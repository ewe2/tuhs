Well, in all fairness, what you are now claiming is that Intel ripped 
off DEC IP when designing PCI. That is not the same thing as claiming 
that DEC designed PCI themselves.

I have not really looked into details on TURBOchannel compared to PCI to 
say if they are related in some way, but they are definitely not 
identical. So PCI did originate within Intel, and the Wikipedia article 
is correct (and even if you point fingers at Wikipedia for various 
issues about money and whatnot, you most of the time do have source 
references that can be checked, and which are not fabricated by Wikipedia.)

And yes, Intel certainly ripped off DEC IP a couple of times, so I would 
not be surprised if this turns out to be another example. But DEC did 
not design PCI.
