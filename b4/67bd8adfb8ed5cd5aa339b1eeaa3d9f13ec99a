There is a provocative article published today in the lastest issue of
Communications of the ACM:

	David Chisnall
	C is not a low-level language
	Comm ACM 61(7) 44--48 July 2018
	https://doi.org/10.1145/3209212

Because C is the implementation language of choice for a substantial
part of the UNIX world, it seems useful to announce the new article to
TUHS list members.

David Chisnall discusses the PDP-11 legacy, the design of C, and the
massive parallelism available in modern processors that is not so easy
to exploit in C, particularly, portable C.  He also observes:

>> ...
>> A processor designed purely for speed, not for a compromise between
>> speed and C support, would likely support large numbers of threads,
>> have wide vector units, and have a much simpler memory model. Running
>> C code on such a system would be problematic, so, given the large
>> amount of legacy C code in the world, it would not likely be a
>> commercial success.
>> ...
