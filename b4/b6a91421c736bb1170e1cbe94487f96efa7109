Yes, but you've removed the reference to the incorrect expansions.  As
I noted at some length earlier in this thread, that's not appropriate.
It ignores the fact that people have made these claims, it removes the
comment that they're unsubstantiated, and it prepares the field for
somebody else to make the claim again, with possibly even more bizarre
expmanations.  I won't back it out yet, because I can see further
changes coming from other directions.  Once again this Tedickey
character has been very active.
