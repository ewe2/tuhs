Probably because the NetBSD list, unlike the tuhs list and most others,
doesn't mess with the headers or body in any way - not by attaching a
"helpful" tag to the Subject, and not by appending an xtra fake sig with
unsubscription info.

Either of these "modern" paractices will invalidate the source DKIM
signature, and so also trigger a DMARC reject if a strict policy is set.

By the way, my inbound processing automatically strips the Subject tag
before I get to see the messages.  It is useless.
