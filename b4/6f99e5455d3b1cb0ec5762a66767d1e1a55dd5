Subject: [TUHS] Berkeley Unix / BSD history presentation at NYCBSDCon
Message-ID: <alpine.NEB.2.01.1011031914010.1774@t1.m.reedmedia.net>

I will be giving a lecture at NYCBSDCon on November 13 about my research 
covering the history of Berkeley Unix and will highlight some of the 
important events and key participants in BSD history.

I have done over 50 interviews with early participants, including during 
the first Berkeley UNIX Software Tape, the Second Berkeley Software 
Distribution, and vmunix period. (I still have many to do.)
