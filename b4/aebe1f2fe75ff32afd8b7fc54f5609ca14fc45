It's more complicated than that.  The issue isn't to do with /r, I've checked all that, it's to do with permissions.  If I execute the script in my home directory it runs fine, if I execute it in the directory I am intending to use for building packages on it blows out.  This happens whenther I use the scripts from the package or write my own.  I have all of the directories above this set to 777, right up to wherre I have the device mounted.  It is on a separate device.

I am now well confused!!!!!!
