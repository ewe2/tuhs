I figure that a Celeron is a superset of the 386 - ergo, of the 286
also - so there shouldn't be a problem.  Maybe I'll do that though,
it's safer in a sandbox.

!!

I think if you converted the ASM to some other format, you could use
Turbo C++ to build it, though...haven't tried that, I don't grok ASM.

LOL, I have 6 working C compilers on the Windows/DOS side of my box
already :) (Turbo C++ 1, Borland C++ 3, Watcom C 11, djgpp, MinGW32,
Cygwin)
