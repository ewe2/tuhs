Oh, I have fond memories of the Masscomp.  That's where I learned how to
do sys admin (recovered from an rm -rf /) as well as networking (based
on 4.1c BSD as I recall, plus hacks).  Masscomp had a really nicely redone
version of the socket programming docs that was most helpful at the time.

I was ..!uwvax!geowhiz!geophys!lm as I recall and all the geo* were 
Masscomps.

Ah, the joys of 20 users on a 40MB disk.  That's why I wrote something
that turned Honeyman's time optimal but space worst case pathalias
db into O(time optimal) as well as O(space best case).  Only dynamic
programming alg I've ever done and written up.
