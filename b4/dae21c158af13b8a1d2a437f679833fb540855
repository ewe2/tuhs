The original X series part was originally unnumbered but a sticker was
later set for the lids that said X68000 (I had one on my desk - which was
used for the Tektronix Magnolia prototype).[1]  The X series ran at 8 Mhz,
but the original released (distributed - MC68000) part was binned at 8 and
10  as were the later versions with the updated paging microcode called the
MC68010 a year later.   When the 68020 was released Moto got the speeds up
to 16Mhz and later 20.  By the '040 I think they were running at 50MHz

[1] I think I still have the draft list of issues in my files.  There was a
halt and catch fire style error you had to be careful about (I've forgotten
the details - but if you executed it in supervisor mode, the ucode turned
on the address drivers in such a manner that they stopped working after
that and the chip was ruined).  I only did that once ;-) when we were
debugging Magix (the OS for Magnolia)
