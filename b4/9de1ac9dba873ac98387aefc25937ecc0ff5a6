Subject: [TUHS] Fwd: Re: X Windows preX10R3 releases
Message-ID: <200710182345.07767.wes.parish@paradise.net.nz>

I emailed Jim Gettys on ancient X Window System code and this is his reply.  
(I asked him if it was okay to pass this on to the TUHS list, and he said 
yes.)

He's after someone who knows ClearCase, so if there's anyone on this list 
who's knowledgable, or knows someone else who's knowledgeable, feel free to 
get in touch with him.

Thanks

Wesley Parish

Yup.  I have bits back to the very beginning of X, and slightly
before.... I have snapshots of our RCS pool back into 1984 or so;
unfortunately, I did not copy the RCS pool itself which would have every
commit.

I also have copies of the X Consortium backups; in there are ClearCase
databases which the RCS pool was imported into, and may have the commit
by commit history back to the beginning for many files; but it will take
someone with ClearCase expertise to retrieve things from that.

I've been meaning to do something with these for the last couple years,
but have been too busy with OLPC to follow up.
