 From a mailing list I belong to, a back-and-forth is going on that I am 
not involved in. The following sums it up nicely:

Seriously? What do (or would) "original C" programmers think of this? To me, anything non-zero is "true" so the first is perfectly acceptable.

The original assertion in the discussion was that the following is not "right" because of the mixing of bitwise and boolean.
