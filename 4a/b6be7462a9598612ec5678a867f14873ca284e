I would definitely want an image of the 4.4BSD tape too!  But I do mean *tape*,
not what's on Kirk's CD-ROM.  I'm talking about a record-for-record image of
the Official Release Master tape.

Actually I just took a closer look and it has been in the distributed
/usr/lib/learn since 4.3BSD, it was just never added to /usr/src/usr.lib/learn
for some reason (not even in Quasijarus, I probably didn't notice it).  So you
don't have to go through the pain of downloading a dist from Harhan to pull it
out of there, you can just take it from your CD-ROM set.

Well I'll take a look at what they did to learn in 4.4BSD and see if any of it
is acceptable for Quasijarus.  Hopefully I won't have to reinvent the wheel.
I believe in adding new features without breaking or disturbing historical
stuff.  It feels so great knowing that my current modern OS (last release
2003-12-07 counts as current and modern to me) still has nearly all original V7
UNIX code almost completely untouched.  It's what gives me the right to call it
UNIX.

As far as learn goes I think I would need to add new lessons for UNIX on a CRT
or some options or somesuch, but I do NOT want to remove the facility for
teaching UNIX on a hardcopy tty.  That's such a gem, it should be kept!
