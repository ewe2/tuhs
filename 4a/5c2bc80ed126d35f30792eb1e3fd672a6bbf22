Proffessor Toomey:
    I have an interesting problem for you....

    A friend of mine here in Denver, (Colorado,US) is in posession of a
PDP 11/73 and litterally a ton of peripheral hardware- it was left in
her house by her ex-husband who more than likely dumpster-dived it while
working for the phone company. The Ex is a talented Computer guy, but a
bit of an idiot in his personal life....

Friend wants to find a new home for this machine.
Friend is erratic. Also fairly pissed off.
Could probably use some money, but mainly wants the thing to go away,
rather than calculate actual dollar value or whatever.... Would be happy
if it went to a good home.

What does one do in such a situation?

In my case, I found your web-page near the top of a Google search.....

Regards,
Joe Dellea
