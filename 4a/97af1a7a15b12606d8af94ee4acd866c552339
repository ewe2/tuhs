Does anyone know if UToronto's MRS database system (from about 1979) has
survived?  It was described in:

Robert Hudyma, John Kornatowski, Ivor Ladd.  MRS: A microcomputer
database management system.  Proceedings of the 1981 ACM SIGSMALL
symposium on Small systems and SIGMOD workshop on Small database
systems, pp 174-180.

Apparently it was distributed to over 50 unix sites.  This is the
software which became the MISTRESS and later EMPRESS products.
