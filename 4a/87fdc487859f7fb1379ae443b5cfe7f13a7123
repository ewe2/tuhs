But also "Release 4.2 was launched in February 1982 for both the 3B & the
DEC
machines. It contained improvements to the data communications and
networking
software and more mature IPC" though it goes on to say 4.2 was provisional.
5.0
did have more things from CBUNIX: init and getty.

I've also found this:

https://groups.google.com/g/net.unix/c/-H9x36DMOBQ/m/P_G_s9SJBrgJ

"Eventually, UNIX/TS was augmented to have
many of the features present in CB-UNIX (this was done by Roger Faulkner
at Indian Hill, BTL. This, in turn, became the base for UNIX 4.0, which
was never released externally."

This from a supervisor at Columbus...
