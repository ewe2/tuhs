Tim, I think the as we have from the s2 tape is a V2 assembler, as it has
an 0407 header, not an 0405 header.

Patching the V2 as binary to work like V1 is going to be hard. I even though
about modifying the V7 as to output 0405 headers, but again hard.

Given that we know the assembler has predefined symbols, which means
renaming $mount, I think we might as well take the path where we modify
the source code so that it can be built with the tools we have, which is
your option 2) above. And of course, document the changes.

Cheers,
