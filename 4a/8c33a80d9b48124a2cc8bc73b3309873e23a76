Thank you Heinz for correcting my poor memory. I don't think we ever met.
Using LSX was a fun project.

LSX was before DOS and far better than any DOS in my view.

Thank you for responding.

    Not true. LSX was developed by yours truly during the mid-70&#39;s<br>
    while I was at Bell Labs in Murray Hill. See BSTJ July/August 1978,<br>
    page 2087-2101. It was developed to support some real-time<br>
    features like contiguous files and asynchronous I/O. A number<br>
    of groups in Bell Labs used LSX and added device drivers to<br>
    support their dedicated applications.<br>
    <br>
    Western Electric (WE) was responsible for licensing the UNIX system<br>
    at the time and only provided source code for the UNIX system for<br>
    the PDP11 computer with an MMU for $20K. LSX source code<br>
    was not included in this. <br>
    <br>
    I also developed (actually modified and wrote device drivers for)<br>
    a version of the UNIX system that ran on the PDP11/10 computer,<br>
    which also did not have an MMU. It could support up to four users.<br>
    I believe that the source code for this system (Mini-UNIX) was <br>
    provided to some universities by the UNIX Support group at <br>
    Bell Labs. WE did not license this.<br>
    <br>
    I do not believe that WE ever considered licensing a binary<br>
    version of LSX or the UNIX System to run on the IBM PC or<br>
    any other microcomputer. WE only offered binary licenses<br>
    later on, and then only for the PDP11 with an MMU first.<br>
    In hindsight, a missed opportunity, but that&#39;s another story.<br>
    <br>
    Doug may be able to offer some insight into this as well.<br>
