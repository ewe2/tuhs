I must be stupid or something. What quadratic algorithm?
vi gets the "correct" terminal database entry directly from the 
environment. Admittedly, getting any variable out of the environment 
means a linear search of the environment, but that's about it.

What am I missing? And once you have that, any operation still means 
either searching through the terminal definition for the right function, 
which in itself is also linear, unless you hash that up in your program. 
But I fail to see where the quadratic behavior comes in.
