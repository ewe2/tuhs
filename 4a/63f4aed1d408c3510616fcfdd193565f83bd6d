Hi all,
  Wanting to set up an 11/34 or 11/23 with a unix that's at least
contemporary enough to run telnet and ftp.  From what I can gather on line,
I guess 2.10 is the best shot, but it's apparently a little less popular
and I can't fin enough docs about it to determine if it'll run with the
hardware I have.  Am I on the right track here, or should I be considering
backporting the programs to 2.9?  Pointers to 2.10 Setup manual would be
most welcome as well as suggestions on where to find other resources to
meet this goal..

thx
jake
