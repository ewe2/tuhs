As was mine mostly 8-) I remember it from the PITA it was to translate 
in my head.  Unix folks looked at partitions as /dev/dsk/0s0->0s7 (I 
think 7 was the SVR2 maximum.  The "Unix" partitions fit inside the 
FDISK partition or dos slice... The dos guys looked at it kind of like 
the fdisk space disk0 partition 3 (for example) was the partition and 
then the BSD folks broke that in to /dev/sd0a /dev/sd0b /dev/sd0c etc.

I did a little SunOS and SysV along with Dos and Windows and could make 
them coexist as long as there was an open primary dos partition.

Sounds like SLS -- Soft Landing System -- which later was pretty much 
replaced with Slackware.  I used the early MCA stuff on PS/2's at IBM 
for a while.  Most of the PS/2 stuff we had was SCSI.  The boot loader 
was lilo.  It could go in the partition space or disk mbr.  
See:https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-bootload/index.html

                    Sure, IBM's anemic marketing, and their
                    close-to-outright-hostility to 3rd-party developers
                    didn't help.  But what killed it, really, was how
                    damn good its 16-bit support was.  It *was* a better
                    DOS than DOS and a better Windows than 3.11fW.  So
                    no one wrote to the relatively tiny market of 32-bit
                    OS/2.</div>

                  <div>I fear that had Linux not made the leap, MS might
                    well have won.  It's largely the AOL-fuelled
                    explosion of popularity of the Internet and Windows
                    ignoring same until too late that opened the door
                    enough for Linux to jam its foot in.</div>

                  <div>Hurd was, by the time of the '386 Unix Wars and
                    early Linux, clearly not going to be a contender, I
                    guess because it was about cool research features
                    rather than running user-facing code.  I kept
                    waiting for a usable kernel to go with what Linux
                    had already shown was a quite decent userspace, but
                    eventually had better things to do with my life
                    (like chase BeOS).  It was like waiting for Perl
                    6--it missed its moment.</div>

                  <div>Plan 9 and Amoeba were both really nifty.    I
                    never used Sprite.  Neither one of them had much of
                    a chance in the real world.  Much like Unix itself,
                    Linux's worse-is-better approach really worked.  <br>

                  <div>I have a hypothesis about Linux's ascendance too,
                    which is a personal anecdote I am inflating to the
                    status of hypothesis.  As I recall, the *BSDs for
                    386 all assumed they owned the hard disk.  Like, the
                    whole thing.  You couldn't, at least in 1992, create
                    a multiboot system--or at least it was my strong
                    impression you could not.  I was an undergrad.  I
                    had one '386 at my disposal, with one hard disk,
                    and, hey, I needed DOS and Windows to write my
                    papers (I don't know about you, but I wanted to
                    write in my room, where I could have my references
                    at hand and be reasonably undisturbed; sure
                    Framemaker was a much better setup than Word For
                    Windows 1.2 but having to use it in the computer lab
                    made it a nonstarter for me).  Papers, and, well, to
                    play games.  Sure, that too.</div>

                    non-destructively repartition it, and create a

                    computer for school and screw around on Linux.  I'm

                          community of interested folk willing to build
                          their own thing, and that weren't interested
                          in Windows NT.  (Nay, one should put that more
                          strongly...  That had their minds set on
                          something NOT from Microsoft.)  So I think we

                        out of its sails, given that there's the dozens
