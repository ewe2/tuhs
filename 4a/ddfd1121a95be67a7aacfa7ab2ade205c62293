Not true, sorry ;) The host irises was my SunOS machine that I used for 
USENET news because it had 1GB SCSI disk on it. The host kilowatt was 
the modem front-end for my BBS and did all the UUCP processing. I was 
...!mcdhup!kilowatt in the early 90's.

RFS was included with SunOS 4.1.3 that I installed on irises. See below, 
motd shows SunOS release, and /usr/etc/mount* are all dated the same 
day, so it was installed from the SunOS 4.1.3 distribution at the time 
of initial install.

 From my archives:

medusa# pwd
/export/archive/tapes/irises.3/a2
medusa# cat etc/motd
SunOS Release 4.1.3 (IRISES) #4: Sun Mar 6 15:14:38 EST 1994

This is irises, a sister to kilowatt. It is a Sun Sparc IPC. I hope to
move to this platform in the near future, but for now, it has to be a
conglomerate.
