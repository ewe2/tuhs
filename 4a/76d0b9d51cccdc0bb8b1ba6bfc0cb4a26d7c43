Absolutely, there were always open bug reports that couldn't be
reproduced, or were a side effect of misusing the product, etc.

We didn't ship with stuff that we thought should be fixed and could
be fixed.

I wasn't there but it's hard to imagine anything as complex as an
operating system went out the door with everything fixed.  I dunno
how the kernel was done back in the day, but for us, doing a release
was a 6 month process.  If you reset that process each time a new
bug comes in, you'll never ship.  At some point, you have to balance
the set of features and bugfixes you can fix against whatever new
thing that shows up.  It's definitely an art to get that right.
