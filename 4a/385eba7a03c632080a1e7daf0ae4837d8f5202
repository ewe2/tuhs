Isn't time wonderful .....   4.2 and 4.3BSD predates the release of bind,
which was separately sent into the wild..

The good news is that you can certainly get things working with a static
host table.   And frankly for a simulated system, the network is likely to
be very small and you are unlikely to need more modern services like a
browser with URLs et al.   That said, the early bind will work on 4.2/4.3
without a lot of hassle, as that's the system that it was developed.
Except .....   the problem is the >>client side<< is used all over the
place AND that needs to know you a DNS.

My suggestion is getting 4.3 running up with a very small (static) host
table.   Then take on the DNS.   The resolv library (client code) is likely
to have a lot of static calls to the old (non-DNS based) versions of
gethostbyXXX and the like.   If you bring bind over, you'r probably going
to have to do a full rebuild and relink , reinstall of applications space
clients use the DNS, not the static tables.

Have fun.

Clem
