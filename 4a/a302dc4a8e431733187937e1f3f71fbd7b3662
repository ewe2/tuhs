According to my memory, reinforced by reading the manual section File
System (V), there are several limits.

The disk size (in 512-byte blocks) is kept in the super-block as a
16-bit integer.  This implies at most a 32MB file system.  Since at
that time there was only one file system per disk, that means a
maximum 32MB disk.

The file size (in bytes) is kept in an i-node as a 24-bit number,
implying a maximum 16MB file.
