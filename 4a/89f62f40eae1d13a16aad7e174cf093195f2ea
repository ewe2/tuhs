Subject: [TUHS] OT: critical Intel design flaw
Message-ID: <CALMnNGh7FJ7LYgna1LKJUSW9+bE5O7cSEK8PViqqogwe08V8ow@mail.gmail.com>

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/

Including here as it concerns Unix kernel and leaking memory from kernel
space to userland.

This is big -- it appears this is a fundamental Intel bug that exists in
all x86_64 CPUs.

It will be interesting to watch the ramifications and impact of this on the
industry as a whole.
