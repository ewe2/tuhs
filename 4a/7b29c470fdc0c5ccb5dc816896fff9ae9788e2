mamun

tks for the prompt reply but we need the rate to malaysia not to jeddah and 
the rate must be break bulk because cntr will be very expensive.  since each 
shipment is about 15 000 tons (fifteen thousand tons) it means we'll need 
about 700 cntrs !!! , and the contract will be about 150.000 tons divided 
into 10 shipments of 15 000 each .


break bulk will be much cheaper , pls try to find some one else very 
urgently try shipco people maybe they can do it.

pls mamun this is very important and top urgent , also I need reply 
overnight as client is losing patience.

tks & rgs
zouhair
