Thanks for taking the time to produce a CSRG repo that seems to
mimic changesets as they really happened.  As i never made it
there on my own, i have switched to yours some weeks ago.  (Mind
you, after doing "gc --aggressive --prune=all" the repository size
has more than halved, it was the final reason to prepare new
repositories on a vhost with good internet connection before
getting this through my flaky wifi here.  Storage and internet
bandwidth and their cost really do not seem to bother anyone
anymore.  I have no offense in mind, i only recognized it (the
hard way).)
