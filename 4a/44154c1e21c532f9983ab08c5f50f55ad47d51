Actually the 11/780 and 11/785 used an 11V03.(I believe they had either 12
or 16k of memory to start and when upgrading to the 11/785 the console was
upgraded to either 16 or 28k.

  The OS was a very stripped down one.  It used an RT11 filesystem, but I
don't know if it was RT11 based.  I was told it wasn't.

The 11/750 was 8085 (IIRC) based.  The 11/730, I think, used an 8088 or 8086

The 8600/8650 used a T11 chip on a special board and ran  a version of RT11
IIRC.

The later (85xx) Vaxes often used left-over Pro350's and later Pro380's as
VAX consoles.

The biggest problem with RT11 on the Pro is they had to make the bitmap
display emulate a DEC standard terminal. (Not sure if it was VT100 or just
VT52 compatible...)

I gave away my Pro350.  They'll get my Vaxstation when they pry it from my
cold dead hands.  (Or my wife wins the argument).
