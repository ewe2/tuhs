Anders -- good for you.

That said, as one of those 'grey beards,' can I recommend that you stop,
and go to a technical library or bookstore and find yourself a copy of Rob
and Brian's wonderful book: "*The Unix Programming Environment*" (*a.k.a*
"UPE" or ISBN 0-13-937699-2)  *then do the exercises*.  That book is still
relevant today - a little secret, I give a copy of it and "*Advanced
Programming in the Unix Environment*" (*a.k.a.* "APUE") to all my new
engineers - even though they are all using 'Linux' for their work.  To
those that object at first, I remind them, Linux is just the current and
most popular implementation of the ideas from Ken, Dennis, Doug, and
friends and I'm sure they will learn something from the time invested[1].

FWIW: Besides learning ed (which will help you unlock some of the mysteries
of other UNIX tools like grep and sed), take a shot at looking at the
introduction to nroff/troff (as has been discussed here - not to restart a
war).  Learning to use a 'document compiler' like the troff family is never
a bad investment.

Have fun,
Clem


1.]  BTW I have yet had a young engineer that actually did try the
exercises not come back and say something like "Wow, I never knew ...."   I
don't gloat, but I smile inside, know that I just made them a more
effective for our team.  If they ask, I point out I had been using UNIX and
hacking on the kernel most every day for at least 10 years when it first
appeared in the early 80's (84/85 I think), and I learned a few tricks when
I read it.
