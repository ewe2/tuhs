I ran NetBSD at home for over fifteen years until last year, on both a disk
server and a workstation, and usually on whatever odd hardware came my
way.  For the most part it was extremely clean and efficient, but at some
point I realized that for amd64 hardware there was a real lack of
performance as compared to Linux.  NetBSD is wonderful for running on older
or exotic hardware when performance is not the #1 consideration, and as far
as I know the networking stack is still among the best, but for a day to
day workstation it just wasn't able to cut it anymore.
