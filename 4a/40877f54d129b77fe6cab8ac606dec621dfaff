Hi, take a look at http://mapage.noos.fr/clefevre/4bsd/

you will found the listings of some archives found around the net some years ago.
don't ask me where, I can't remember. If you are interrested by one or more
of them, let me know, I'll provide you in a way or another.

FYI, appart the 4.3BSD-Tahoe archive, the following one is also broken :

4BSD/Distributions/4.3BSD-Rev2-Foreign/usr.tar.gz

4BSD/Distributions/4.3BSD-Tahoe/src.tar.gz
4BSD/Distributions/4.3BSD-Tahoe/usr.tar.gz

Cyrille.
