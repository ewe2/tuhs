Subject: [TUHS] C reference manual
Message-ID: <200210171314.g9HDE2D11674@minnie.tuhs.org>

To forestall those who haven't looked: the good news is that
the papers from Volume 2 of the manual were included in /usr/doc
on the V7 tape; the bad news is that the C Reference Manual was
omitted.  Here is /usr/doc/cman in its entirety:

  Sorry, but for copyright reasons, the source
  for the C Reference Manual is not distributed.

Presumably the problem was that the Reference Manual was published
as part of the a real book in 1978.

I forget just what Tony was after in the first place, but maybe
some of the stuff on Dennis Ritchie's home page will help:

In particular the Sixth Edtion version of the C Reference Manual
is there.
