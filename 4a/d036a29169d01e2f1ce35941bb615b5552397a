Dude, I was there.  Jolitz used to work for me at Sun, Theo's Sun 4/470
was given to him by me, I know most of the players.

I agree BSD was a better starting point if there was one BSD.

The problem is there was {386,Net,Free,Open,DragonFly}BSD where there
should have just been "BSD".  One, not a bunch.

Where do you think Linux would be if there was {A,B,C,D,E,F,G}Linux?
There is one kernel.  One and only one.  With everyone working on that
one kernel.

If you can't see the difference, I don't know what to tell you.  Are you
seriously going to take the position that BSD is better off because
it has all these variants and replicated effort?  Because if you are,
this conversation is over, at least from my point of view.
