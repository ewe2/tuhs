Subject: [TUHS] DR11-W - anyone need one?
Message-ID: <8cb760b6-65fa-b540-01a1-c33a7dc8c4f3@kilonet.net>

Probably no one here wants it, but I have a DR11-W UNIBUS board: 
http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/unibus/DR11W_UsersMan.pdf

It's basically a 16-bit DMA interface that can actually do 500Kw per 
second (woo hoo! 1MB/sec!) to another DR11-W

Anyone need it? Want it?

Figured I'd try here first, in case we had some historic UNIX people 
that were still running a UNIBUS PDP-11 (or VAX).

No takers in a few weeks, I'll try the museums next.

thanks
art k.
