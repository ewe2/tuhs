Looks interesting.  Forty-six papers, each with a brief essay by Harry
Lewis setting the context.  ‘...with an emphasis on the period of
1936-1980 but also including important early work’.  Amazon shows 4.8
out of 5 stars after 26 ratings: 77% 5*, 23% 4*.  https://amzn.to/3rkvPaU

One review says ‘The book originated from a discussion course the
author taught at Harvard’, another points out Thompson's ‘Reflections’
is missing.  :-)  Amazon's ‘Look inside’ works to give a flavour.
