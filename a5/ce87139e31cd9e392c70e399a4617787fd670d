Hi,
  I had a disk in my 11/83 that I'd set up for autoboot.  The pdp11 would
load block 0, load /boot and happily count down 5 seconds, then continue on
with kernel loading & regular bringing up of the system to multiuser.
That was cool!

So I pulled that disk out and plugged it into my other system with a dual
height 11/73 (this system has same CMD CQD-200 scsi controller) and it gets
to the countdown part and stops!  I'm wondering why.

The initial bootblock load is apparently fine and loading and running of
boot is happening.. its just that the countdown stays stuck at five and I
have to hit <cr> to get it to boot (and the rest of the boot sequence is
totally normal).

I had a suspicion that maybe the clock isn't working on the 11/73.  Would
that make sense?  Maybe boot is actually using a clock somehow?  Maybe I
have to check jumpers on the 11/73 to be sure its clock is enabled?

Just thought I'd float the question here in case someone remembers this
oddity before I start digging / "use the source."

thx
jake
