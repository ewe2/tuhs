These days the modification generally consists of pam_krb5 added to the

And similarly =E2=80=93 in other protocols (IMAP, SMTP, IRC, the same LDAP)=
 one can
authenticate a session via SASL, which usually wraps GSSAPI, which usually
wraps Kerberos.

You're right, it's primarily an authentication protocol. But due to the way
it works, it *also* negotiates a 'session key' between the user and the
service, which then may be used for transport encryption (sealing). It's
not commonly used as far as I know =E2=80=93 most new protocols already hav=
e their
own security layers such as TLS or SSH.

Actually LDAP is the only still-widespread protocol that comes to mind
whose implementations frequently make use of Kerberos-based encryption (via
GSSAPI). This is especially common in Active Directory environments, where
the DCs might not have a valid TLS certificate.

(I seem to recall kerberized Telnet didn't survive because it was limited
to DES/3DES for an odd reason. Didn't quite understand why that was the
case, though.)
