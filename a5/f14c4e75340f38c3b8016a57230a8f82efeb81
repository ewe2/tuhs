Subject: [TUHS] Classic Unix workstation GUIs

The recent FOSS release of CDE has got me thinking of other Unix GUIs
from the "golden age" of workstation Unix. Obviously, stuff like
SunView and OpenWindows from Sun and 4DWM/Indigo Desktop from SGI are
pretty well known, but I've always wondered what else was out there.So
far, I've come across Looking Glass, DECWindows and HP VUE. Is there
anything else of any importance/interest out there?
