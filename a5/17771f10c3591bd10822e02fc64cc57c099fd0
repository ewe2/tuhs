Subject: [TUHS] UNIX tools updated
Message-ID: <20041216225544.3286fdce.txomsy@yahoo.es>

I just noticed this site by a posting on Groklaw.net:

	http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/

I don't remember having seen it here before, and I believe it is worth a look.

The Heirloom Toolchest is a collection of standard Unix utilities derived from
legacy Caldera-released sources and brought up to date to a number of versions
(SVID3, SVID4, POSIX, 4BSD) with support for UTF-8 and other enhancements.
