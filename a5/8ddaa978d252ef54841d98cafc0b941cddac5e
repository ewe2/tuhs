Apropos of the 'my iPhone has more power than our System-360/50, but it =
has nowhere near the sheer I/O throughput of a mainframe' comment: =
there's obviously no doubt that devices like phones (and laptops, =
desktops &c) are I/O-starved compared to serious machines, but comparing =
the performance of an iPhone and a 360/50 seems to be a matter of =
choosing how fine the dust you want the 360/50 to be ground into should =
be.

The 360/50 could, I think, transfer 4 bytes every 2 microseconds to/from =
main memory, which is 20Mb/s.  I've just measured my iPhone (6): it can =
do about 36Mb/s ... over WiFi, backed by a 4G cellular connection (this =
is towards the phone, the other direction is much worse).  Over WiFi =
with something serious behind it it gets 70-80Mb/s in both directions.  =
I have no idea what the raw WiFi bandwidth limit is, still less what the =
raw memory bandwidth is or its bandwidth to 'disk' (ie flash or whatever =
the storage in the phone is), but the phone has much more bandwidth over =
a partly wireless network to an endpoint tens or hundreds of miles away =
than the 360/50 had to main memory.=
