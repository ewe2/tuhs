I recall a message to the list a year or two(?) ago from Warren (I think) 
describing how he had to explain to one of the many incarnations of SCO[1]
just exactly what all this "UNIX" stuff was that they had bought (i.e. 
all the nth Editions, SysIII, SVRx, etc).  I'm too lazy to search the list 
archives to find it, but it's there someplace.

[1] The SCO-variant that was the ancestor of Caldera/Novell.  My brain 
turns to cottage cheese every time I think about this part of history.
