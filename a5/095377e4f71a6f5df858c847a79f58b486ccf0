Hi Paul,

I have seen in the tuhs list, that You are going to upload 4.2.10 sources .
Can You tell me , where did You get if from ?
Or You mean sources of 4.2.14 once available at demon or mayn ?

Or Did You get it from MWC ?

Regards
Andrzej
P.S It does not mean I am interested . I have authoried sources of 4.2.10.
