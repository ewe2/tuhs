Subject: [TUHS] Whence 1st Edition Unix Kernel Assembly?
Message-ID: <20080423060356.GA88398@minnie.tuhs.org>

All,
	I'm sure I saw a PDF document a few years ago which was an early
UNIX kernel written in assembly code. I thought I had saved the document,
but alas I can't find it. Can anybody remind me where to get it, or
perhaps I was hallucinating!

Thanks,
	Warren
