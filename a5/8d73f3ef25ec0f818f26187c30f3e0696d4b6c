Subject: [TUHS] where is "the true arpanet mailer"?
Message-ID: <alpine.NEB.2.02.1311261000450.15942@t1.m.reedmedia.net>

I am reading the delivermail (later known as postbox and then sendmail) 
code from 4.0BSD and from sccs history from June 1980.

Its arpa-mailer(8) manual says it just spools the letter and actual 
delivery will be performed by the ARPANET mailer daemon and refers to 
mailer(ARPA) manual. The arpa.c code says "is stuck away in the 
outgoing arpanet mail queue for delivery by the true arpanet mailer."

Where is this true arpanet mailer?  I am guessing it periodically looks 
in /usr/spool/netmail/ and delivers the messages using FTP and RFC458. 
Where is this mailer(ARPA) manual?

Where is the ftp server code used for the incoming mail? (Example 
code mail-dm.c is provided for the ftp server to "handle the MAIL <user> 
command over the command connection.")

Also where is the uucp-mailer(8) manpage referenced in delivermail(8)?
