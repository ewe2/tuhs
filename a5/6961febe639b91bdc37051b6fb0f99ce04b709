Subject: [TUHS] v5 and v6 kernel is mode 777
Message-ID: <CADxT5N5HEftowuKauBvujcNAm9OCqK+xJrevkEGq=eoO4MhtEA@mail.gmail.com>

I just had it brought to my attention that the unix kernel is mode 777
in Unix v5 and v6:

ls -l /unix
-rwxrwx  1 root        27066 Mar 23  1975 /unix

There's no reason for it to be mode 777 is there? It seems rather dangerous.

In Unix v7 it defaults to mode 775 and in 32v it is 755. I figure it
setting it to mode 755 will work and so far it seems fine in v5.
