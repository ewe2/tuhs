If I could get the Consensys running that I used to have that would be 
great, it would be "authentic" to me at least.

However, it relies on either an Adaptec 1540 SCSI controller, or the 
standard ISA WD MFM/RLL controller (and maybe ESDI), which my VMware 
environments can't support. I'm reluctant to go into running yet another 
emulator anywhere on my home office network, so it might be Unixware 2.1 
which I managed to get running in VMware.
