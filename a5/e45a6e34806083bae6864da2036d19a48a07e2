The trouble is that there *is* no legal filing on the Linux without
IBM case.

Ah, sorry.  Got to pass on that one.  They probably have the rights to
XENIX.

There are plenty of cases where you need to initialize a data
structure.  Many data structures are public knowledge, and
initialization is a brainless enough task that the code could have
been written independently and look almost the same.  Does this line
ring a bell?

	(*bdevsw[major(bp->b_dev)]->d_strategy) (bp);

How many people have written that independently of each other?
