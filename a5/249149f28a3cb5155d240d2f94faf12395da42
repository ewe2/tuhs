The record is quite clear on that.  How the 50 fixes tape got out of Bell
Labs may not be as puzzling as the song the Sirens sang or who blew up
Mallow Bridge, but likewise the question is not beyond all conjecture.
Ken wanted those diffs out there, the more so because they didn't all
come from inside the Labs.
