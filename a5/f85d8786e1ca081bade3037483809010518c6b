No prob.. If I get a SLIP link up and running I'll just suck down the right
date from an NTP server on my net which is synchronized to a radio clock.

Heck, I could just hook up a clock receiver to the machine directly! 

I hardly ever bother to set hardware clocks in my machines anymore. The
batteries in my VAX for the clock and stuff ran out quite a while ago, but 
no problem either..

Any idea about version numbers I could check? This machine was used until 
pretty recently in a production environment and maintained pretty 
well on the hardware/firmware level. I don't think it was decomissioned
because of Y2K, but because they were told that they could provide a 'better' 
service with a Micro$oft solution. 

Last thing I heard is that the new solution is sorta falling apart all over
the place.. Not surprising to me, but they're not getting this machine back! :-)

							Bye, Arno.
