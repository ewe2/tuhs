Happy New Year to you all. It's also the year we will celebrate the
50th anniversary of the Unix timesharing system. Just FYI, I hope to
be in Los Angeles the week before the 2019 Usenix ATC, to go to the
CHM. Then to Seattle before the ATC to visit the LCM+L, then the ATC.
Hope to see some of you along the way.

I'm feeling the need to get a few other people to help out curate and
maintain the Unix Archive. Not that it changes very often, but it might
help to have some fresh eyes (and opinions) look at it and add/improve it.

So if there is any interest from a few of the long-time TUHS members,
please e-mail me. I run Nextcloud on the server, so if you can run a
client at your end and have about 4G spare disk space (or less if
you are only interested in a specific section), that would be great.

I'll be away for about 7 days but I'll try to read/respond to e-mails.

Cheers, Warren
