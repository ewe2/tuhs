I don't mind staring at the assembly, I just don't want to hand crank it any longer. :-/

I'll spend quite some time fussing with the compiler and optimization flags to get loops to run at maximum speed before I'll take the assembly in hand to 'make it right.'

For stack traces, I've found the GNU compiler support for stack tracing quite handy and for my company it works quite well.

On the discussion of x86 assembly, I have to agree that it is horrific. I'll take ARM (and I have done context switchers and trap handers in ARM) any time.
