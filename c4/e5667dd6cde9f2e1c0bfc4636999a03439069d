Self taught touch typer here.  I frequently compare typing to running
my excavator.  If I don't think about what I'm doing, everything works,
I can type in the dark (doing that right now) but as soon as I start
thinking about where the keys are (or what the joysticks on the excavator
do) it all goes to shit.

And getting back to writing, I personally feel like if you write the 
man page first, it settles my messy brain into a good space, the code
comes easier after writing docs.  I view writing docs as sort of the
first pass of thinking about how to write the code.  Doesn't always
work but it is pleasant when it does.

My parents encouraged it mostly because it would make  writing term papers much easier, which it did, but of course it had many computing benefits as well.

I never did develop good typing skills. I'm pretty much a two-fingered typist. Ironically, I have probably done more typing than 90% of the female classmates who were allowed to take the class.
