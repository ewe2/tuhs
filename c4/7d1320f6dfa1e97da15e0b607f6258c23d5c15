IS25: just so. I managed to retrieve the scanned PDF for
the manual for this virtual instruction set.  It's an
internal memo, but I'll send it if anyone asks.  It's
2.8MB of page images and is 108 pages long.

The memories of Lindsly and Lowenstein are also apposite.
AT&T donated quite a few machines (3B20 and 3B2) to universities,
and though they appreciated the thought, there were
various drawbacks--the gift didn't include maintenance, for
example.
