This appears to have been inherited from UFS.  My recollection is
pretty much the same for UFS, and even the man page entry for EXT4 is
closely related to UFS newfs(8):

Linux:

       -m reserved-blocks-percentage
              Specify the percentage of the filesystem blocks reserved for
the
              super-user.   This  avoids  fragmentation, and allows
root-owned
              daemons, such as syslogd(8), to continue to  function
 correctly
              after non-privileged processes are prevented from writing to
the
              filesystem.  The default percentage is 5%.

FreBSD:

     -m free-space
             The percentage of space reserved from normal users; the minimum
             free space threshold.  The default value used is defined by
             MINFREE from <ufs/ffs/fs.h>, currently 8%.  See tunefs(8) for
             more details on how to set this option.

And I can confirm that file systems slow down significantly after the
last 1% of free space has been used.

Hopefully Ted will comment.  But UFS has had even more decades.  And
arguably 600 GB on a modern disk is less of a concern than 15 MB on a
300 MB disk 40 years ago.
