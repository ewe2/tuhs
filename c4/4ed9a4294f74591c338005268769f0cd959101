RH did make several strange things that did make me wonder whether they are 
really an OSS company, but they have a person working in the OpenGroup core 
team.

This person (Eric Blake) usually helps to connect to developers from glibc, but 
he of course knows about the problems GNU software has with the POSIX standard.

He is one of the active people in the teleconferences and he does not try to 
bend POSIX to follow what is in use on RH-Linux.

I remember several cases where he helped to convince GNU people to make their 
programs POSIX compliant.
