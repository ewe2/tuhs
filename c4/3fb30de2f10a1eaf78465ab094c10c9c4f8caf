Uh...? Where do you see that there is any TCP/IP support in Ultrix-11? 
If any was done by someone else, there is no saying that it would be 
usable on a machine without split I/D. To be honest, I've never seen any 
mention of TCP/IP on any machine without split I/D space. I guess it 
could be done, but it would be a rather big headache...
