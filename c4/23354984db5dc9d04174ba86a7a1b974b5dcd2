Ø  Well, I had known but forgotten in fact.  There's also a distinction
between whether a system swaps/pages onto a dedicated device and whether it
exposes that device by some special name in /dev.  

 

Im pretty sure that swapping in V6 took place to a major/minor number
configured at kernel build time.   You could create a dev node for the swap
device, but it wasnt used for the actual swapping.
