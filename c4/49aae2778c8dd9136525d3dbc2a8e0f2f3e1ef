Sorry to top-post...

To me, the biggest handicap to getting anything done, code-wise, 
command-line-wise, basically anything, is the keyboard/mouse.

I use keyboard shortcuts as much as possible, being an old LA36 kind 
guy, but I would love to have something that just by looking at text, be 
able to highlight, copy/cut/paste, etc.

Even action buttons. It would be great to look at the "Send" button in 
Thunderbird and press a key on the mouse or keyboard (or some other 
eye-contact type signal) and "do" it.

Was anything ever done in terms of sub-vocalization? Lots of stories in 
Sci-Fi about that, nothing ever came out of it, I don't think.
