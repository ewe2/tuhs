Thanks for the feedback, all.

Rand ports were done in 1977 by Sunshine/Zucker. I=E2=80=99ve only come =
across Rand Ports in the context of V6 and the Arpa crowd 1977-1981. =
I=E2=80=99ve never seen a reference to Rand Ports on V7 or later. This =
of course does not mean that it did not exist.

I=E2=80=99ve dug further, and it would seem that named pipes under the =
name =E2=80=98fifo=E2=80=99 appeared first in SysIII (1980). That =
matches with Luderer=E2=80=99s remark. It does not seem to exist in the =
Research editions. It only appears in BSD in the Reno release, 1990. All =
in all, it would seem that =E2=80=98fifo=E2=80=99s were a SysV thing for =
most of the 80=E2=80=99s, with the BSD lineage using domain sockets =
instead (as Clem mentioned).

Interestingly, Luderer also refers to a 1978 paper by Steve Holmgren =
(one of the Arpa Unix authors), suggesting =E2=80=99sockets=E2=80=99 (in =
today=E2=80=99s parlance) for interproces communication.

PS really nobody on the list recalls Luderer's (et al.) distributed Unix =
and how it related to other work ??
