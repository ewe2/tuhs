Those look an awful lot like the distribution disks for COHERENT 4.2.10.
There's a writeup of how to get that installed and running under qemu here:
http://thebeezspeaks.blogspot.in/2012/05/my-life-with-coherent-part-2.html

However, there have been some reports of stability issues with the emulated
disk under qemu; VirtualBox seems to be the most consistently reliable (and
fast!) alternative, but you have to run it under a 32-bit host OS.  I ended
up installing a 32-bit Linux under VMWare to run virtual box to run
COHERENT (yes, it's awful).  I haven't tried qemu lately to see if the
stability problems have been addressed, though.
