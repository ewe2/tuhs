Subject: [TUHS] Did realloc ever zero the new memory?

On every system that I've ever used, I believe that realloc did not do a zero fill. There might have been a time when malloc did a zero fill, but I never counted on it. I always performed a memset or bzero after a malloc. I'm pretty sure that I counted on realloc to NOT perform a zero fill.

I’ve just had a discussion with my boss about this and he claimed that it did at one point and I said it hasn’t in all the unix versions I’ve ever played with (v6, v7, sys III, V, BSD 2, 3, 4, SunOS and Solaris). 

My question to this illustrious group is: Did any Unix or Unix like OS ever zero fill on realloc?
