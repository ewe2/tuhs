Subject: Good news on the Ancient UNIX License front
Message-ID: <20000508150240.A7092@loomcom.com>

Hello all,

I've just received this mail from SCO.  I think it's appropriate to
post here.

Apparently we can expect the Ancient UNIX License available on the
SCO website by Friday (U.S. Pacific Time, I would suspect).  Very
good news indeed!
