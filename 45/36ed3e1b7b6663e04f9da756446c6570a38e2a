The fact that a pointer of zero generates a hardware trap is not defined in=
 the language, whereas a 0 is is defined to be a null pointer.=20

I've worked on systems where a 0 pointer could be dereferenced without a tr=
ap. I wouldn't recommend it. System designers do things like make the first=
 page of memory invalid so we will get a null pointer trap. On Plan 9 the b=
eginning of the text segment starts at 0x1020.

But that's not part of the C language. The fact that 0 is a null pointer is=
.
