Before I headed off to my first summer job, my mother, who was working as
a programmer, gave me some good advice: "before you throw away a deck of
cards, put a rubber band around it...".   Saved my butt twice that
summer...

Incidentally, I figured the other day that a Petabyte of data, if punched
onto punched cards, would make a deck that was 6 times higher than the
distance to the moon...
