I simply wrap gcc in this script:

#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/bin/gcc -m32 "$@"

to solve problems like this.  I keep it in ~/bin named gcc32 and
then rename it to gcc when I need to compile 32-bit-specific code.
It's much better than trying to whack on the Makefile.  I wish I could
use a similar hack to get bas/bs running directly on Linux: they seem
to assume 16-bitness, and segfault quickly.
