I remember Ron! He was quite a character. And I remember festoon.

Was it he, or Bob Flandrena, that gave us the holiday poetical and 
phonetical treat:

     Tweeze Denied Beef Workers Isthmus

(Say it out loud fast, with a pause in the middle of "Workers", to get it).

I think I have it on paper somewhere, but no soft copy.

On this occasion,
no team responsibilities could have polyesced a renewed emphasis.
A friction had penated an activation.
At the present moment in time,
an undue number of good progresses being collected together with the populations were being proportionately fideated by
 the fact that there was a data stream which was transenniesced by an issuance being joined together with these team re
sponsibilities,
because natural basises have been veriating a partitioning.
The supplementary work should be conclusively quinquepolyated by a well defined interfacing.
A sophisticatedness by a schedule is operated by a nature in conflict with a correspondence under some serious discussi
ons.
It is within the realm of possibility that the effectiveness had vicfacesced a schedule,
but there was not a necessary background information which is being testesced by a strong interest,
and a statistical accuracy was tempoesced by the preparation.
It should be noted that a joint partnership very repeatedly aidioated this publication of a centralized organization.  
Due to the fact that there is a simplification which simply enniesced a process,
a new technology is fluxesced from monorogatities.
It is of the utmost importance that an insurance could be putated by an assumption.
A major advance centered about a deficiency octocessates an important outcome.
.P
An effectation would extramicroate to the situation.
A complete revision gravated a direction.
Inasmuch as there was not a potential usefulness that cedeates by the timely delivery,
a consideration centered around a technique was monofortated by an integration:
.BL
.LI
There is a not unclear meterdom which had risiesced an occasion.
.LE
.P
A clamstress of this enclosedness is cludescing the hemidormity.
.P
To arrive at an approximation,
a large quantity had been chromated by a strong feeling.
Moreover,
that idea sharing was lusated by a current proposal.
Anytime that the final outcomes had been very firmly unpathesced by not unphilaible reasonable compromises,
no serious concerns might be being sacrated by internal establishments for the basic objectives in back of a full utili
zation.
.P
As a consequence of the fact that a total effect might vacate an easily situational beneficial assistance,
the apparent provisioning being effectuated by a continuing difference can have protenesced a realization of an underly
ing purpose.
A different doubtful important outcome is cludated by a capkin.
A rationale had fortated attachments.
Moreover,
this assumption had nilcoresced the continuing study.
.P
.H 1 "An Easily Added Basic Assumption Being Joined Together With A Concept Stage"
There is not an impediment which neoated a restriction,
therefore.
A couple utilizations could morsate a great similarity at considerable difficulties,
but an input is primescing the concept activities,
and a growing importance was hemicisesced by that beneficial assistance.
In the same connection,
these extremenesses are rather usefully ultralucesced by directions.
