I was able to social-engineer an operator a few times on TOPS-10 systems 
back in the day to reset passwords, or mount disks. "Can you give me a 
list of disks you have ready to mount?" - "blah blah blah" - "OK, mount 
pack BLARG".

But then, one time, I was talking to an "operator" for a while before I 
realized it was an ELIZA-like program that kept going back around in a 
loop. Trying to be suave, I started it by asking how they were doing, 
and got all sorts of weird responses.

At some point, realizing I was talking to a bot, I said: "I feel bad" - 
and it replied something to the effect of "Can you explain why you feel 
bad?". Typical ELIZA response ;)

Someone at that university had a sense of humor, that's for sure. Broke 
into it anyway guessing passwords.
