So at least in that case, a WAIT could result in the kernel sitting around waiting for the next interrupt. I don't really think DEC intend WAIT to be used in the way Unix uses it, and it don't really have the properties that would be ideas for Unix. Also somewhat indicated by the fact that DEC did not use WAIT this way themselves.

I don’t have access to the RT11 or RSX source to see how DEC used the WAIT instruction, but here’s how UNIX did it on the 11/40. It’s ridiculously simple as there’s no display register to manage.

_idle:
	mov	PS,-(sp)
	bic	$340,PS
	wait
	mov	(sp)+,PS
	rts	pc
