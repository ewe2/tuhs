One of the best things about DEC was the lack of taking itself too seriously. 

11/730 product announcement for the Solar Horologue... 

See the above in Google and Slashdot.

​I don't remember which comic it was, but about 8-10 years ago one the late
night comedy guys brought a film crew to SC and made that same exact
observation.​

While Intel does do many things well, this one is part of company culture
and I'm not in a position to change it.  I wish I could.  I think the place
would be a small bit happier if it did not take itself quite so seriously,
but that's just my personal opinion.


As the late Roger Gourd used to say: *"Bring me to a sacred cow, and I'll
start up the sacred bbq." ;-) *
