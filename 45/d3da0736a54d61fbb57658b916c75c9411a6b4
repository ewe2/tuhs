peed *vs.* pooped -  one is marking territory while the other is destroying
it.

+1 and that's why it is even more difficult to understand.   Being polite
and 'fitting in' would really not been any harder than being like Jon's
father-in-law.

I'd maybe say it as they don't want to be real Unix people and fit it with
the rest.

Frankly, trying to turn a Lisp Machine into a "Unix box" would have been as
much of sin, in my eyes. Hey, I'm thrilled to see rms and his friends can
build and purchase as many LMI box as he would like (But I do observe, the
'technically superior system,' in the end, wasn't very economical).   I
really don't mind bringing things over (like more, or job control, or
command/filename completion that all came from other systems).  That is
really adding value to the new system (UNIX in this case).

touch=C3=A9

As Larry and Jon have said better than I, it was the seemly effect of tryin=
g
to replace man with info that I just don't understand.     As Larry has
said if they had made a way go from texinfo to man, even if it had been a
little rough on the edges, I might have grumbled, but I would have tried to
use it.  The truth is today, like many other Unix hacker I know, if I am
offered a new tool but using it means that I am being led down a path to us=
e
info/texinfo, I rethink if I want to use that new tool or not.   It's a big
turn off for me to want to learn to use such a tool since I know the
authors have made no attempt to integrate it into a traditional UNIX
workflow if they have not built proper man pages, much less written
traditional docs.
