Thank you for your efforts Warren.  I owe you a drink if I ever see you 
in person.

1)  Please expand the list to participants that run DKIM / DMARC 
filters, Gmail being quite common.  I personally run such a filter and 
would appreciate being moved so that I don't accidentally reject message 
from others.

2)  I think you can configure Mailman to only munge From addresses if 
the sender's domain has DKIM / DMARC.  -  I don't know if that changes 
things or not.
