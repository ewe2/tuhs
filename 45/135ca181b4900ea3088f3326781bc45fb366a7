Yes, the RK05J is the removable one, as described above.  The RK05F is
the fixed version that doubles the density.  However, to the system, it
appears as two separate drives, not as a single 5MB drive.  I am not
sure how the data were interleaved between the two "logical drives"
which is important when scheduling seeks on the logical drives.
