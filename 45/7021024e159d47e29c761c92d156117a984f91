Part of the https wave is the fact that the Tin Foil Hat Society thinks 
they are being maliciously monitored by the gov't. The move towards 
privacy on the Internet is fostered by this conspiracy-minded 
thoughtlessness. Meanwhile, it just adds another step to any entity 
wanting to figure out what you've been doing online. Either monitor your 
browser (ala telemetry), or the websites themselves. If one were to see 
https traffic to a website that's known for it's racist content, then 
that pretty much defines what you've been doing without having to 
decrypt the actual packets. Much less get your search history from 
Google in the first place.

I've heard this very same privacy concern from what I consider 
moderately intelligent people I associate with.

I have a (very) small website in http that has a few TOPS-10 items for 
download. That doesn't need to be https, but for some reason, I've heard 
that Google will lower my rankings because I'm not using https. What 
tomfoolery is this?
