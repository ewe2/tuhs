Subject: Problems booting 2.11 on a 11/84
Message-ID: <199812212159.NAA07290@moe.2bsd.com>

Hi -

	What CSR do you have the TC13 set for?

	The Boot ROM did it's job of reading in the 512 byte boot record and
	transferring control to location 0.

	The bootblock relocates itself to 48kb which is 0140000.

	I don't think the problem is cabling in this case.  

	If you have another system that you can view the sources with the
	file you really need to have in front of you at this time is
	/usr/src/sys/pdpstand/mtboot.s

	The section of code where the system is halting (with added octal 
	offsets) is:

0262		bne	ctlerr
0264		bit	$!1000,hter(csr)	/ any drive errs except HTER_FCE
0272		beq	bumpaddr		/ no, go bump address
	ctlerr:
0274		halt

	The label 'ctlerr' is shared but it indicates that a controller
	error was encountered out of the 'tmtscom' common logic (shared between
	the MT and MS drivers):

tmtscom:
	bit	$100200,(csr)		/ error or ready?
	beq	tmtscom			/ neither, keep looking
	bmi	ctlerr			/ error - go halt


	The thing to try is when the system halts looking at the registers
	(R0 thru R5) _and_ the tape controller registers (starting at 0172520).

	It's also possible to look at the command buffer being presented to
	the controller by looking at offset 0460 (0140460).  Not sure how useful
	that will be though.

	It might be possible to single step the processor starting at location
	0 as long as R0 and R1 are set up correctly (R0 has the unit number
	and R1 the control register address which is 172522 for MS and MT
	devices).

There is a diagram at The Internet Operating System Counter which is at
http://www.hzo.cubenet.de/ioscount/.  Take the "Unix networking" link.
It was published in iX, a German magazine.

As I feared when I heard it came from iX, it's *very* inaccurate.
For example, it claims that 1BSD was derived from 32/V (should have
been 3BSD), derives 1BSD from 1BSD and 4.1BSD (should be 4BSD) from
the second 1BSD (should be 3BSD), derives ``BSDI'' from 4.3BSD, when
in fact BSD/OS is derived from 4.4BSD, doesn't mention System V(.1) or
System V.3, etc.  And all this is OS code, not networking code.

Dear PUPS List, 

I have an Emulex TU13 tape drive interface.  Does anyone on the list have
the dip switch layout so that I can program them properly?

Thank You,

Merry Christmas,

Rick Copeland
