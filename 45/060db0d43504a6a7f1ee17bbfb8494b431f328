Robert, I forgot to cc my reply to the others on the PUPS mailing list.
Would anybody in the US be able to look at Robert's tapes to see if we
can recover System III? John Holden just donated System V to the PUPS
archive, so System III would also be a good addition.

Please email to Robert & the mailing list if you are willing to look at
the tapes.

Thanks in advance,

	Warren

Hello,

Curiousity, How does one get a license for a PDP-11 version of unix these
days?  I've had an 11/73 I've been itching to run unix on.

<See the petition hyperlinked on http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/PUPS/

I've done the petition.

<Hopefully (soon) you will be able to buy one from SCO for about US$100.
<You can get the binaries for v6 and v7, see Bob Supnik's PDP-11 emulator
<on the same web page.

I also know of the binaries for v6 and v7 at several sites for emulator use.

What is unclear is how to get those binaries onto a real PDP-11 such as my 
11/73 and if the devices I have are even supported.

Sorry for the misunderstanding Allison!

Actually, that's a very good question. As I'm not a hardware person, I'll
pass this over to the other PUPS mailing list members. If/when SCO start
selling licenses & we make CD-ROMs or FTP sites available, this question
is going to come up an awful lot:

Question 1
----------

How do I get a Unix distribution onto:

	- a tape, because I have a tape drive

	- a disk drive, as I don't have a tape drive

assuming I [ have RT-11/ RSX / no operating system ] on the PDP-11 already.

Question 2
----------

I have [ this particular CPU and this list of other peripherals ].
What version(s) of Unix can I run on this PDP-11?


Can anybody help out with answers to Question 1? Bits & pieces of Question 2
are answered on the PUPS web pages, but they need expanding.

Thanks in advance for any information, and any programs (boot code etc)
that I can add in to the PUPS archive!!

	Warren
