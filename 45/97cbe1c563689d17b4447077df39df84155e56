Hello from Gregg C Levine
How do you mean by that? " The links pointing to the 'unix_v7_rl.dsk'
image I found are dead ... :-(" You said. How so? As I recall, that file
that's in there, for unix_v7_rl.dsk" is there, it's a totally different
UNIX_v7 file name, you need to call it that for the E11 product. For
SIMH, the full name as rendered by the extraction process from the
compressed file works.
