The first edition ran on pdp-11, not pdp-7.

Tukey buttered parsnips at the labs, but Brits did
so several centuries before.

Contrary to urban legend, patent was not invoked to
justify the Unix pdp-11; word-processing was. The
quiz does not make this mistake.

The phototypesetter did not smell. The chemicals
for (externally) devoloping photo paper did.

Shahpazian is Dick Shahpazian; Maranzano is Joe Maranzano.

cagbef addresses out of bounds.

I appreciate Rob's discretion about the Waterloo theft.
