This stuck a chord for me this evening. I completely understand why such a
saying would come into being, having watched things like cdrecord as a
young person - I totally get the view on licenses here. But I had a chance
to work with J=C3=B6rg, if only tangentially, on a project and found him to=
 be
warm, engaging, brilliant and overall quite pleasant. I was in a unique
position to connect J=C3=B6rg and Henry (yes, that Henry) to talk about som=
e old
Unix arcana and it was magic to witness. I hope that in addition to J=C3=B6=
rg's
eccentricities people also remember how neat he was as a person. He was a
brilliant mind.

Thanks
