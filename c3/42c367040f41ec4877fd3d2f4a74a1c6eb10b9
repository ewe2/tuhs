Subject: [TUHS] UNIX V 6.9999999 ?
Message-ID: <CA+rfG9Z7N03m2ss0sWJtF4BftK_kS_SficQXFKwqCZ7Z6xHCew@mail.gmail.com>

While cruising olduse.net I came across this puzzling entry in net.general


            Department of Computer Engineering and Science

                    Case Western Reserve University

                            Cleveland, Ohio



        We would like to announce our connection to Usenet. We are a

private university located in Cleveland, vacation spot of the midwest.



        The department's primary facilities consist of:



        VAX 11/780: hardware: RM05's, TU77, DZ-11, DH-11 (able), 2.5 Mbytes.

                    software: 4.1 BSD



        PDP 11/45:  hardware: RM02, DS330 (RP04), RK05, RX02, RS04(solid
state)
                              cache45 (able), DH-11

                    software: UNIX V 6.9999999



What is UNIX V 6.9999999?? I suspect it's v6 with a bunch of patches, but
not quite v7?  I've seen from some Russian stuff that they prefered v6 on
pdp-11's as it "ran faster" than v7 and needed far less ram/disk space... I
know it's 30 years too late to ask them what it is but I figure someone may
have actually ran/used 6.9999999...


Thanks
