One of the really nice things about Go is that all the library source code
and documentatin is installed by default and you can run a local instance of
the documentation server on your laptop (or whatever).  Likewise, the
specification is one HTML page - if you really want, you could convert that
to PDF but having all the hyperlinks is really handy.  (I haven't tried
running a local copy of the playground but that should be possible as well).
