Agreed.

Those were all discrete jobs and associated files in the UUCP queue.

It's my understanding that bag files were an aggregation / collection of 
what uucico (or something closely related) would typically write to the 
modem connected to the remote system.  This output was redirected to a 
single, monolithic file, called a bag.

At least that's my understanding.

This bag would then be transferred some means out of band.

The last time I did this, someone would periodically ftp the bag files 
off of the server.  (I don't remember why he wanted bag files instead of 
standard UUCP.)

I've heard of people using bag file(s) to put news (et al) onto a flash 
drive / tape and sneaker net it across to other disconnected systems 
where the process was done in reverse.

That's typical UUCP.  That's distinctly different than my understanding 
of bag files.

Yep.
