In my humble opinion, "spool" means files in transit. Run something 
locally, it generates a file, it gets shipped somewhere (email, printer, 
etc) and it's gone.

On Linux and Solaris (to a lesser extent), /var/lib seems to be 
configuration files like samba's password database, and other "non 
transient" files.

If you're storing files for long periods, /var/spool is not where you 
want to do that. Again, IMHO.
