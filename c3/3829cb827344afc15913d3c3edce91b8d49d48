Interesting.  WRT sun and vax, those were the two most popular platforms
at the time. So if you wanted to spread the Free Software gospel, it
made sense to target those platforms first.

Targetting 68020 also made a number of other vendors potentially available.
Apollo comes to mind, I'm sure there were others.

I remember bootstrapping GCC 1.0 on one of the vaxen I ran when I
was a sysadmin at Emory University. I don't think I played with anything
earlier but I don't remember.

I know it’s old, but it’s funny how pro SUN they were at the time.
