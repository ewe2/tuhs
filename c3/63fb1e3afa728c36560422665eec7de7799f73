I give them credit for remounting read-only when seeing errors, they may
have gotten that from BitKeeper.  When we opened a history file, if we
encountered any errors we opened the history file in read only mode so
if it worked enough you could see your data, great, but don't write on
top of bad data.

Me too.  Though with a 32TB drive (I'm guessing rotating media), that's 
going to take a long time.   If I had a drive that big, I'd divide it
into managable chunks and mount them all under /drive/{a,b,c,d,e...}
so that when something goes wrong you don't have to check the whole 
32TB.

That's a stretch, they are just trying to not encourage you to make a 
mess.

I sent Linus an email to find out where btrfs is, I'll report back when
he replies.
