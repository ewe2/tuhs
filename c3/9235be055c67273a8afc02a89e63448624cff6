It's not me, it's all of you.  OSL has a gigabit link to the net if I
recall correctly.  But I don't think TUHS needs that.  There are only
so many of us old farts.  But fast is nice.

I do think that there is a _huge_ amount of value in the TUHS archive.
I think that anyone I hire who has not wandered through there, should.

Anyhoo, I'm pinging the OSL guys, I suspect that they will be cool about
hosting a mirror, they have been way cool in the past.  For that matter,
they'd host www.tuhs.org but I suspect Warren may not be cool with that.
Dunno.  I can arrange introductions, they are a cool group, this is a
cool group, who knows?

I'm off to put the chickens to bed (yeah, I live in that sort of place.
My net connection is a 100KB/sec but http://bitmover.com/lm/house makes
it worth it, great to live in the country with the bobcats, coyotes,
boar, mountain lions, and still commute to silicon valley).

I'll report back as soon as I know more.  Happy holidays to everyone and
for the record, I'm one of those guys that have learned a huge amount
from the old school unix and apply it to this day.  One of my machines
is named slovax because that was the 11/750 at Wisconsin that held the
BSD source and I had an account.  Still remember the day I read popen()
source and realized you code fork in libc - that was an eye-opener.
I think it still has a lot of value and appreciate Warren and all of
you for caring and passing on the knowledge.

Cheers all,
