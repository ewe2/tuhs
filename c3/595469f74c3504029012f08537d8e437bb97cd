Just a quick question.  Was the `dc' command introduced with one of the
BSD releases or did it exist in an earlier version of Unix like the 6th or
7th Edition?

I see it on the System III and Version 7 systems.   I don't see it in V6 distro 
however.

It appears in the First Edition manual, and according to A Quarter
Century of Unix, it's even older than that.  "There was also a version
of dc, desk calculator, a very very early program.  That was actually
the first program that ran on the PDP-11.  It ran standalone before
there was an operating system." (p. 35)
