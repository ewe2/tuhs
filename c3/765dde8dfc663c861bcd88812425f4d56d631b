I still like one-letter switches, and my programs sometimes use tons upon 
tons of them.

Even well into the days of tab completion, I still often keep my filenames 
down to 8 characters or less plus extension, which leaves people wondering 
what the heck "L34-01.MP4" is. (spoiler: "Lupin the 3rd, Part IV, Episode 
1")

That said, just yesterday I was wondering what the heck "TANGALA.BAS" on 
my hard drive was.  (It was a TANdy 1000 program that played the startup 
jingle from GALAga.)

-uso.
