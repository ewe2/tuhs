Subject: [TUHS] Anyone know what a LANTERN is?
Message-ID: <1501171118.69633.1054588920.11864815@webmail.messagingengine.com>

There is a character in the terminfo/curses alternate character set,
ACS_LANTERN, which is mapped to "i" in the VT100 alternate grapical
character set. This character is, in fact, on a real VT100/VT220 (and
therefore in most modern terminal emulators that support the full ACS),
"VT" (in 'control character picture' format, along with HT FF CR LF NL).
The ASCII mapping uses "#", and some CP437/etc mappings map it to the
double box drawing intersection character.

Was there ever a real 'lantern' character? The manpage mentions "some
characters from the AT&T 4410v1 added". What did it look like?
