I=E2=80=99ve been wondering about the growth of Unix and if there=E2=80=99=
s any good data available.

There=E2=80=99s the Early Unix Epoch, which probably ends with the Unix =
Support Group assuming the distribution role, plus providing / =
distributing their version of the code.

Later there=E2=80=99s commercial Unix:
	System III and System V, I guess.

BSD, until the lawsuit was resolved, required a Source code license, but =
their installation count is important in pre-Commercial Unix.

Large licensees like SUN, HP & IBM (AIX) may not have published license =
counts for their versions - but then, were their derivatives =E2=80=9CUnix=
=E2=80=9D or something else?


Warner Loch=E2=80=99s paper has data to around 1978 [below].

I=E2=80=99ve no idea where to find data for USG issued licences, or if =
the number of binary & source licences were ever reported in the =
Commercial Era by AT&T.

I=E2=80=99ll not be the first person who=E2=80=99s gone down this road, =
but my Search Fu isn=E2=80=99t good enough to find them.

Wondering if anyone on the list can point me at resources, even a bunch =
of annual reports.

I don=E2=80=99t mind manually pulling out the data I=E2=80=99m =
interested in. But why reinvent the wheel if the work is already done?
