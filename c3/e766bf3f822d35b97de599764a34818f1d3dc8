​If I can find and read some old mag tapes with sources, I'll try to get
you earlier dates to put into your records.  I'll take that off line.​

​1981 -- That makes sense...   I would come to UCB in September of '81, but
IIRC wnj had spent the summer before @ research; where Ted spent his
summers also.   Ted had came to CMU in '76 I believe and developed what
would become fsck that year on the EE Digital Lab's 11/34

@ CMU, later in '76, EE & Bio Med got an Unix machine of some flavor, as
did Mellon Institute (which would be the system with the first commercial
UNIX license for a University).     fsck did not make it over to CS to the
11/40e's until later probably '78, likely by dvk who was not EE but common
with me @ Mellon.

I took it with me to Tektronix in '79.    I think Wayne (an CMU EE UNIX
hacker) took his Hawaiian shirts to Cambridge, MA in '78, so that's about
the time it would have made it to MIT.

The important point is that fsck was 4-5 years old by the time it made it
to UCB and was already migrating to other places via sneaker-net.
