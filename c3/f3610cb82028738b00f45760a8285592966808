Can't tell you definitively.  You'd need to ask some one like Andrew.

FWIW: the 11/40 has a MMU, but does not support split I/D like the 45.  He
has  256K bytes [128k words] as the Max memory.  IIRC v6 will boot with 48K
words [96K bytes] - maybe a little less.  But the less physical memory, the
slower the system (the more it swaps).

DEC was just switching to semiconductor memory at the time and it was
pretty expensive.  The MS11-B was MOS based 18 bit x 4K word modules for
the 11/45, which were dual ported Unibus and Fastbus.  I have forgotten
what the 11/40 used as we tended not to use DEC memory modules***.

Lions and his team was likely to have been between 96K and 256K max,
depending on budget.    In my experience, we tended to build up to max
memory on systems, but only as soon as we could afford it.  In
my experience, we often bought the machines in phases... just enough to
boot it, with two or three RK05's to start.  Then add more memory and more
serial ports and more terminals.  Then more (larger) disk and maybe a tape
drive and printer, and then even more serial ports and some sort of modems
and network connections.

*** At CMU during those days, we tended to use aftermarket memory or
locally designed memory boards on the 11/40 and 11/34s as EE/CS had
negociate and bought a few megabytes of memory chips from National Semi for
C.mmp at a heavy discount - other groups could add to that order as needed.
