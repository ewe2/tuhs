Anyone remember picasso, a vector graphics GUI app
that generated pic(1) source?

I know nothing of it, anyone got a screenshot even?

is the source available?

was its frontend X11 or blit terminal?

Was it related to the blit cip and xcip tools
or are they a different genus?

Thanks for any info.

-Steve
