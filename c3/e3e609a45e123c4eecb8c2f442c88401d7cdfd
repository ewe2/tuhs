Picture tapes. I had a collection of 20 or so. A few of them were girly 
pictures, but there were several excellent ones. Nemoy as Spock holding 
a model of the Enterprise. Neil Armstrong on the moon. My favorite was 
the PSA grinning bird over the San Francisco Bay - it was 8 strips wide. 
FORTRAN carriage control to cause overstriking. I recently got my 
collection read off the magtape.

My understanding was the a photo was scanned at 256 grayscale levels, 
and the program let you tune the contrast with 16 gray levels of 
different overstrikes, ranging from 4 blanks to M, W, X, @ overstruck.

There's a tool called asa2pdf that can turn the carriage control files 
into PDF, but printing on a laser printer leads to a chore with an 
office paper cutter and lots of staples and scotch tape. I put one 
together of SAN FRAN as a parting gift to a coworker at my retirement 
luncheon.
