But it *was* fixed in BSD, and it's in POSIX as the SA_RESTART flag to
sigaction (which gives you BSD signal semantics).

POSIX supports both the original V7 and BSD signal semantics, because
by then there were programs which expected system calls to be
interrupted by signals (and to be fair, there are times when that's
the more convenient way of handling an interrupt, as opposed to using
setjump/longjump to break out of a restartable system call).

P.S.  The original implementation of ERESTARTSYS / ERESTARTNOHAND /
ERESTARTNOINTR errno handling in Linux's system call return path was
my fault.  :-)
