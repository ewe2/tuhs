I miss Brian on this list.  I've interacted with him over the years, the
one I remember the most was I was trying to do an awk like interface to a
key/value "database".  I talked to him about it and he sent me ~bwk/awk
which had all the original awk source and the troff source to the awk
book in english and french.  

Ken, Doug, Rob, Steve, anyone, could you coax him onto this list?

If you want me to try first I will, I don't know if he remembers me
or not.  But I can try and then maybe one of you follow up?
