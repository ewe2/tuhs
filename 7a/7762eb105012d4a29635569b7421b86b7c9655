Well, I was talking filenames (as also the subject says)... :-)

On the PDP-8, you sometimes saw @ used as a prefix character in SIXBIT. 
So you'd use @M to get a CR, and @J for an LF, and @@ would mark the end 
of the string. But not for filenames. But in code, since you sometimes 
used SIXBIT for string constants as well.
