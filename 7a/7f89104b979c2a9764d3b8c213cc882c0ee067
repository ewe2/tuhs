All,
	With the freeing up of the Unix source, not only can I open up
the Unix Archive to anonymous downloads, but I can now make my Unix Tree
web site available anonymously: http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/

Here is where you will find unpacked versions of Unix source code, and
a means of comparing files between different versions.

Cheers,
	Warren

P.S Thanks to the many people who have set up mirrors of the Unix Archive.
