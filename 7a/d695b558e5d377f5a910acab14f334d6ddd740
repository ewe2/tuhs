The hardware was the same only for PA-RISC based machines (i.e.
HP-9000 800 series and later, not the 200/300/400 series based on
the Motorola 68k nor the older 500 series based on a proprietary
processor).

If I remember correctly, the switch from HP-Windows to X-Window on
HP 9000/300 and /800 series (X10, not X11 at this time) occurred
around 1987 or 1988.
