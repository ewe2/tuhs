With all due respect, may I suggest that this list is precisely the sort of 
resource necessary for tracking down copyright ownerships?

After all, we do have a good number of subscribers who were there at the ealry 
stages of Unix(R)(T[F]M).  (I wasn't - I was a high-schoold student at Deakin 
High, Canberra at the time Prof Lions was writing his Commentary, and the 
nearest _we_ got to computers was an Apple II we got in 1978 - and it was 
mostly used for games. ;)  Sad but true. ;^)

I'm sure we're up to it.  Just ask us.
