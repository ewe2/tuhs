If it's ODS-1 (aka FILES-11) format, it should be possible to mount it
on a Vax or Alpha system, as it is a down-level version of the OpenVMS
format ODS-2.

Let's face it: software is crap. Feature-laden and bloated, written under
tremendous time-pressure, often by incapable coders, using dangerous
languages and inadequate tools, trying to connect to heaps of broken or
obsolete protocols, implemented equally insufficiently, running on
unpredictable hardware -- we are all more than used to brokenness.
