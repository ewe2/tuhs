He did FP as a result of doing Fortran.  In an interview by
Grady Booch he says
  Well, it was just trying to be at a higher level so that
  you didn't have to get into all those gory details and
  stuff. Basically, the idea was to try to describe the
  transformation that you wanted to take place, rather than
  how to do it. It evolved very slowly and peculiarly.

But he said ultimately his effort failed because he couldn't see
how to deal with real time. Something he worked on for years.
