This is the sort of reason why QBUS x86 machines exist...  Not cheap, or
easy to come by these days, but they filled a niche of emulation but with
access to real hardware... Nor easy to find with a web search, it seems :(.

There's a number of nuclear power plants that employ MACRO-11 programmers
because they can't swap out the old gear w/o going through a prohibitively
expensive recertification process... It's cheaper to hire and train good
programmers than it is to go through that process :(.
