In Henry Spencer's v7 sources there is a "struct void" in
cmd/sh/mode.h -- may have to do Bourne's fascination with
Algol68!

Bitfields were available but they were not used in v7 sources.
May be because v7 pcc generated slow code for bitfields access.
[Gosling's emacs used bitfields extensively. I managed to
compile it but it ran extremely slowly on a 5.6Mhz Fortune
box. That was the main reason I didn't switch to emacs. Then
Yost brought along the Rand editor and I used it until it
would no longer compile on *BSDs.]

IIRC the differences between that version of Dennis=E2=80=99s compiler =

stdio was first released as part of the typesetter compiler but it was =
still a work in progress.  =20
