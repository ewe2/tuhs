Subject: [TUHS] where the docs have gone
Message-ID: <201509282014.t8SKE0qq001737@coolidge.cs.Dartmouth.EDU>

The disappearance of some troff-related documents that had
been on line at Bell Labs was recently reported on this
list. That turns out to have been a bureaucratic snafu.
Plan 9 and v7 are back now. It is hoped that CSTRs will
follow.
