Most of the following is in
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/research/

v1: full kernel source on paper, which has been scanned in and brought
    back to life with the v2 user-mode binaries (see below)

v2: paper copy of Programmers Manual is scanned in, some binary user-mode
    executables and bits of user-mode source code, no kernel anything

v3: machine readable copy of Programmers Manual, nothing else

just before v4: kernel source in C, aka the 'nsys' kernel

v4: machine readable copy of Programmers Manual, nothing else

v5: bootable disk image with full source and binaries, NO machine readable copy
    of the Programmers Manual, but there is a paper copy of the UPM which I
    have not yet scanned in.

v6: bootable disk image with full source and binaries, machine readable copy
    of the Programmers Manual

v7: bootable disk image with full source and binaries, machine readable copy
    of the Programmers Manual

Cheers,
	Warren
