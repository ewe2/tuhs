There is an emulator.. I was actually playing with it earlier this week trying to get SunOS 2 to boot, on a SUN-2 ..  

Anyway it's called TME

I think my machine may be too fast.  It's very touchy to build and I think the slj threadding is really interesting but may also introduce complications...
