I honestly can't tell if this is genius level snark :) in case you're
sincere we generally go to great lengths to build up data types and
structures (in C lingo) when programming only to tear those useful
attributes off often at inopportune times.  Basically type
systems/type safety have been too expensive or too difficult to use
through history.

Think of sitting at an SQL prompt as a counterpoint.  You can pretty
easily get at the underlying representation and relationships of the
data and the output is just a side effect.  Not saying SQL is the
ultimate answer, just that most people have a bit of experience with
it and UNIX so can mentally compare the two for themselves and see the
pros and cons to preserving the underlying representations.

Regards,
Kevin
