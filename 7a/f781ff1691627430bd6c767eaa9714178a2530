The deployed systems in the field have swap space configured. But if we're
not careful we can still run out. Larry's tests are at the extreme limits,
to be sure, and not having swap exacerbates the bad behavior at the limit.
If he's trying to ameliorate bad effects, doing it on worst case scenario
certainly helps. The BSD box allows for it, and it's not that much slower,
but it kinda misses the point of the exercise.

Also, the systems in questions often operate at the limits of the disk
subsystem, so additional write traffic is undesirable. They are also SSDs,
so doubly undesirable where avoidable.
