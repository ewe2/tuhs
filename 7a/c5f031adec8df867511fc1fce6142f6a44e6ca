This is what I've been using for years...

http://gunkies.org/wiki/Mkdisttap.pl

I've been keeping interesting source code tapes here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/bsd42/files/Package%20Tapes/Source%20Code/

And various binaries I've built under simh:


4.2
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bsd42/files/Package%20Tapes/4.2%20BSD/


4.3
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bsd42/files/Package%20Tapes/4.3%20BSD/

4.3 UWisc
