Subject: [TUHS] How Unix brings people together, or it's a small world

Side story on Unix related to Xview.

I go to a conference in San Jose for Sun users in the mid 80’s
and am discussing Xview with a few folks (names lost to memory).
A very nice person named Nancy Blackman walks up and joins
the discussion. We get to talking and she has a weird memory
bug and I’m willing to help her look at it. So we go to ‘her place’
which is her lab at Moffet field. We discuss her bug, find a fix
and I go back home to San Diego.

I mention that I met this very nice lady named Nancy Blackman
at the conference to my wife. Turns out my wife went to school
with Nancy before she moved to San Diego.

So, who else has weird stories of how Unix development or
Unix conferences had the side effect of making the world a
smaller place.

If this is too off topic, drop the conversation here.
