I look at it slightly differently as the person who opened this particular
can of worms.

I'm not saying that the world should be fixed in stone; for example that
there should never be another language because we already have one.

I have trouble imagining how the features of C could be added to Fortran,
Lisp, or Cobol in a reasonably compatible manner.  And I have no issue
with C not being an extension of an existing language even though it uses
some of the features of other languages; to me C was the first non-clunky
programming language.  While I find C++ ugly, at least it uses C syntax
where possible making it a reasonable transition for programmers.

Going back to the original *roff discussion, I would have preferred to see
a ".2D" request for *roff that added two-dimensional formatting.

Guess what I'm saying is that I'm against change for the sake of change;
I'm not against innovation.
