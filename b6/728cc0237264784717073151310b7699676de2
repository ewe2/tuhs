Tom Ivar Helbekkmo:

  Why should anyone need to?  Of all the mailing lists I'm on, this one is
  the only one that has this problem.

=====

Beware tunnel vision.  Another mailing list I'm on has exactly
the same problem, made worse because it's being run by a central
Big Company Mailing List Provider so the rules keep changing under
foot and it's up to the poor-sod list maintainer (who is not a
programmer) to cope.

To bring the focus back to this mailing list, not every program
runs on a little-endian computer with arbitrary word alignment
and pointers that fit in an int.
