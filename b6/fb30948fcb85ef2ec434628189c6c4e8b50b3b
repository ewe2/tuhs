As I am reading the details of this, it seems that they are at a planning 
stage,
and wanting to coordinate the Library of Congress centrally with other federal
and non-federal agencies and organizations to develop the "network" of
libraries and repositories for these materials.  It was not clear what funding
was available to non-federal agencies.  My expectation is that the PUPS
and TUHS efforts ought to be somewhere in the overall thicket of the Library
of Congress effort.  We need to find out more about this legislation and
potential work and funding.  It sounds very interesting...

Spinning the ol' propeller-headed beanie at full speed, and thinking out 
loud....
