Ah, well I remember when "make" was first introduced (in PWB?); I thought
it was Christmas...

Now, even it has to be modified for various platforms.

Trivia: what does "make love" say on your system?  My Mac boringly says 
"make: *** No rule to make target `love'.  Stop." and the FreeBSD box 
isn't much better: "make: don't know how to make love. Stop".  I don't 
know what my Penguin laptop says because it's currently switched off.

Sigh...
