i am confident groff was part of (Free)BSD even before it was
released.  That is, i have used groff with FreeBSD 4.9 (?) base
systems onwards, and i know from the CSRG history that they worked
to get there.  (It is not part of the repo, though, it is only
deduced.  I still don't have the McKusick CD's, shame on me.)
