Subject: [TUHS] Another book
Message-ID: <20160121201901.GB13264@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, Don Libes and Sandy Ressler just donated a PDF of their book
"Life with Unix" to the archive. It's at:
http://minnie.tuhs.org/Archive/Documentation/Books/

I've also found PDF copies of a bunch of other books, so look
through http://wiki.tuhs.org/doku.php?id=publications:books
for links.

Cheers, Warren
