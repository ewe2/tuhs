You are absolutely correct, they sharing culture was around throughout the
50s and 60s.  In fact the IBM "DECUS" equivalent was (is) called Share.
When I say, dop really was creating the idea of  FOSS, it was different
from the sharing that had occurred previously.

Lots of places, such as my own undergraduate institution - CMU and other
places like MIT and Standard, were notorious for "selling" its research.
Pederson had a real epiphany with his "industrial liaison program."  He
wanted ERL  to "know" what was going on in the "real world."   He very much
felt that cost of fabrication machines were prohibitive for a research team
and yet he wanted to be able to work those that had them.  So his idea was,
he would supply the students, and code - free - and then get back room
access.  In fact if you look at my thesis, you will see reference to a
"proprietary digital circuit."   I knew what it was, but was not allowed to
identify it at the time (its the ALU from the Vax 750 -- a very, very cute
design).

ERL had a lot of things like that that most companies guarded.  But dop and
newton were trusted.   It was once said, there was not a secret in Silicon
Valley that Richard or Don did not know.  They were consulting for all the
majors players.

As an example, BTL was researching the FET, came up with the first model
for it.   What was the first program to have that model in it?  Ellis put
it in SPICE2 for the Bell guys.   Same with the MESFET which Tom added for
Tektronix at one point that I remember.

Anyway, the idea really was more than just what SHARE, DECUS or even the
shared code from places like CERN, LANL et al.
