Part of the problem too isn't so much who owns the copyrights, but whether
or not the copyrights for the
V7 and earlier actually exist and are valid. One of the reasons the BSD
suit was settled was at the time
the judge strongly telegraphed that there wasn't a valid copyright by
western union based on the copyright
law at its time of creation.... So even the question of who owns the unix
copyright might not be as simple
as all that... The stuff is so old, there's no money in removing any of the
ambiguity for the current copyright
holders (to the extent that it is valid), so we're left with a lot of
possibility, but no certainty. Though given the
Supreme Court's latest 'fair use' rulings, it wouldn't surprise me if were
it to wind up in court if that didn't
further weaken the answer to the point where it just doesn't matter what
the underlying details are, copying
and making a derived work would be OK. Though that's my own layman's best
guess...
