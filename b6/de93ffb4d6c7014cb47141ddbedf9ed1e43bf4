CTL-D (EOF on input) works for me? Or maybe the version I have (it was a
binary only that came off the Shoppa disks, IIRC) is slightly different from
the one you have, and that only works in this version (which has a number of
extensions).

I don't think I ever found any other way to exit it. Although looking at the
code, it seems like probably the only way is to generate a 'quit with core
dump' interrupt - I forget what character that is in standard V6.
