>I suspect the real reason for C's sucess was the nature of the language.
it has most of the elements of structured programming as known in the 70the=
/80ths, and - most important - it produces small and fast performing binari=
es like no other high level language. Furthermore its syntax is relatively =
close to the system, and systems calls are easily adoptable. Thus for me it=
 still is and ever will be the first choice.=20
