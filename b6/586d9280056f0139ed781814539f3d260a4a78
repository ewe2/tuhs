Sorry, but I couldn't resist. this has been bothering me for days since my
previous post.

I knew it happened but was writing from memory. I looked to my ancient mails,
looked into the net.. (this started to look like the hunting of the snark) and
then remembered it had been discussed in Usenet. Here is the reference now for
the record. I know the message is long, but I think it is worth reading.

There certainly was an Ultrix for Alphas. As I remembered, the first Unix
port for alphas was that of Ultrix, and it was the first OS to run on Alpha
but it was an internal, research development in DEC that never saw the light
of sun. The full thread discussing it can still be found on deja-news: 
search for ultrix and alpha butnot FAQ.
