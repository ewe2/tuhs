Subject: [TUHS] PDP-7 Unix listings?
Message-ID: <4819795B.9010009@gmail.com>

A while ago, I heard someone (I can't remember who) say that he had a 
paper listing of (at least part of) PDP-7 Unix. How much is there in the 
way of surviving listings of PDP-7 Unix (if any)? With all of the 
discussion of OCRing the V1 Unix kernel listing, I was wondering if 
something similar could be done with PDP-7 Unix if enough listings have 
survived (which is sort of unlikely, but you never know).
