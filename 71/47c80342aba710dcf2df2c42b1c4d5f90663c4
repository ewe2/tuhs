I wonder if part of the (perceived?) performance gain was from the 
likelihood that swap at one end of the drive meant that things could be 
contiguous.  Seek, lay down / pick up a large (or at least not small) 
number of sectors, and seek back.

I had always assumed that the outer edge (what I thought was the end of 
the disk) was faster than the inner edge (what I thought was the 
beginning of the disk) because of geometry.  However, as Ronald stated, 
hard drives were constant angular density.  Thus negating what I 
originally thought about speed.
