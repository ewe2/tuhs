I think there is a beautiful simplicity to B code as a high level
assembler or universal machine language.  The lack of types is closer
to the machine since a CPU generally does not enforce types on memory
or register cells.

Adding types to B (to create C) was an excellent design choice,
however another choice would have been to keep it type-less.  Operator
forms would explicitly encode the appropriate type (such as unsigned
right shift >>> in Java, or floating point add #+ in BCPL.)

Pointer dereference and increment symbols would also need size
annotation (perhaps char and word forms would suffice.)

It is interesting to ponder such a language as a universal target for
higher level language compilers, or as a specialized language for OS
and device driver development.<div
