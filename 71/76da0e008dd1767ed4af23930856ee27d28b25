This thread made me a little curious so I went to eBay and found an 11/44
there:

There's also an FPGA SoC on opencores.com that runs 5th edition UNIX and
2.11 BSD UNIX:

http://opencores.org/project,w11

The latter had been a little more than a passing interest for me, but I just
haven't had the time to play with it.
