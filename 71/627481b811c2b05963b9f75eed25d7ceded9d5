I read the paper when it was last mentioned on the list, and it's indeed
impressive: more like awk than perl, except in a few particulars.

Someone asked me once how I dared to use the .sig below.  I replied
that I come from New Jersey, where the very hero sandwiches in kids'
school lunches are made from shoggoth meat, and I now live in NYC,
where the banks foreclosed on sunken R'lyeh.  They're probably going
for a controlling interest in blue-litten K'nyan, red-litten Yoth, and
Black N'kai even now.  Gotta diversify in these degenerate days, y'know.

(About the name: Abdul al-Hazred is an ill-formed expression in Arabic,
having two definite articles in a row.  Correcting it to Abdullah
al-Hazred, which inserts the Divine Name between the articles, gives
the reasonable Arabic name -- or more likely, alias -- "servant of God
the Forbidden".  IRL it's an exoticized version of Hazard, the surname
of some of Lovecraft's ancestors.)
