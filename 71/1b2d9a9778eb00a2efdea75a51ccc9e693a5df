Wow! Thanks. This is stuff I've not thought of in eons. I use to play 
around with early Darwin releases on my Power Mac I had at the time.

I use to have a website dedicated to things I figured out. I even helped 
the author of the Mac Perl book, Chris Nandor, get his Darwin box ( 
which didn't have GUI at the time ), on the internet.
