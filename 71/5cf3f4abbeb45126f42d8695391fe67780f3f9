Hi there,

Sorry for an eventual Offtopic but this is strictly
related to our Computer Museum activity... 

We launched a campaign to get some help for our upcoming
initiative, that will be the starting point for a big step
forward to a new Museum!

So please take time to read it, and please share everywhere to
anyone interested!
