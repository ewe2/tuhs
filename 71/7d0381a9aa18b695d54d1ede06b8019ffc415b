Conceptually I agree.

However, I've had to teach enough people to know that they need a way to 
boot strap themselves into an environment to start learning.

Thus I find having a streamlined process available to them to be 
beneficial.  Then once they have gotten a taste, presuming they like it, 
they can go back and attempt to do more complicated things.

I do consider what (I believe) Warren put together for the UUCP project 
to be a very good start.  Simple how to style directions that are easy 
to follow that yield a functional system.

Conversely, take a look at what's involved in IPLing a minimal MVS 3.8j 
system in Hercules.  (Ignoring the turn key packages.)
