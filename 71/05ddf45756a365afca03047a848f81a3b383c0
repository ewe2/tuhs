Subject: [TUHS] "hacker caught" paper
Message-ID: <de782ac2f282e5bd392722555c6e491a@quintile.net>

I am trying to find a paper. It was written at Bell Labs,
I thought by Bill Cheswick (though I cannot find it in his name),
entitled something like:

	"A hacker caught, and examined"

A description of how a hacker got into Bell labs, and was quarintined on
a single workstation whilst the staff watched what they did.

Does this ring any bells? Anyone have a link?

I know about the Cuckoo's egg, but this was a paper, in troff and -ms macros
as I remember, not a book.

Thanks,

-Steve
