Yes, he had died by the time I knew what UNIX was.   My jest was always that
there was only one person who truly understood troff and he was dead.

We lost J.F.Ossanna in 1977; he had a hand in developing Unix, and was
responsible for "roff" and its descendants.  Remember him, the next time you
see "jfo" in documentation.
