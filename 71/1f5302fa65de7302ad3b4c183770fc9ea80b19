Subject: [TUHS] My response to SCO vs. Linux

Michael

I don�t agree with you on this , your complain about linux is unfair , on 
the contrary to many unixers especially the new generation of hackers and 
new unix users even those users fed up with Microsoft gimmicks , linux was 
miracle touch that helped to re energize the otherwise stale unix market , 
simply look at the market today which operating system has grown beyond any 
expectations ? . Another thing , in the days of corporate greed and bullying 
a-la-microsoft way, linux played a significant role to cement the open 
source movement.

Good old dear BSD , where is it ?? still fighting a niche turf , why it 
didn�t burst in the open ? , it�s troubles doesn�t have anything to do with 
linux it�s been there way before linux surfaced. I will not go into this 
flame war which is better BSD or Linux because both are dear to me and each 
has its own strong points and weaknesses .

Finally , this whole nonsense from SCO wouldn't be there if SCO had any good 
products to offer or enjoying good revenue , so this law suite shows how 
desperate SCO is sinking in the red and using this law suite to float itself 
again .


Love it or hate it linux is here to stay J .

_______________
preparing for eventual flame war ,

automatic sprinkler = check
fire extinguishers = check
fire fighting water hose  = check
fire proof suite and helmet = check

all systems go .
