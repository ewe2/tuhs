Thank you for bringing this up.  I first posted to the list about the 
project in February 2013 [1], and some of you helpfully supplied me 
login names I was looking for.

Over the past few weeks I managed to solve a difficult problem that was 
puzzling me, namely how to commit each release snapshot files 
incrementally, while also ensuring that git blame would work correctly 
across releases.  Having solved the problem, I created a working 
repository with a some key releases in it, and was waiting to tidy up a 
few loose ends before coming to the list for more help.

Now hat the cat is out of the bag, here are a few things I could need 
your help.

1. The login names of the following Bell Labs researchers
Charles B. Haley
E. Schmidt

2. The login names of the following Berkeley authors
A. R. Newton
Charles Haley
Colin L. Mc Master
Douglas Lanam
D. O. Pederson
Ellis Cohen
Earl T. Cohen
Ivan Maltz
Juan Porcar
Jeff Schriebman
Kurt Shoens
Len Edmondson
Olivier Roubine
R. Dowell
Ross Harvey
Richard Tuck
Robert Toxen
Susan L. Graham
Zhishun Alex Liu

3. The names corresponding to the following Berkeley ids
claudio
csvaf
denise
ecc
epg
evan
fitz
fortran
harrison
lam
opcode
orange
rt

4. The authors of a few relatively large contributions (the numbers are 
the changed lines associated with the specific release and corresponding 
total lines).

5. Errors and omissions in the files that map file paths to authors. [2]

You can supply these things via the list, if you think they're of wider 
interest, through private email, or through git pull requests.
