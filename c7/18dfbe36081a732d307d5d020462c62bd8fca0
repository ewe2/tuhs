I wasn't aware of a MicroPDP-11, but I have an LSI-11/73, photos at
http://www.lemis.com/grog/photos/Photos.php?dirdate=20001122&imagesizes=112#Photo-2

Clearly it's a little larger than a MicroVAX.

If anybody's interested, this machine is up for grabs.  I don't want
any money for it, just the knowledge that it will be looked after.  It
comes with a lot of tapes and (RL-02) disks, and also lots of
documentation.  If anybody here in Australia wants it, you're welcome
to come and pick it up.

This one does.  I gather the architecture  is identical to the
PDP-11/73.  One of the tapes includes the 7th Edition.
