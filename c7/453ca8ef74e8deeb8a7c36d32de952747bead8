  I found a document addressing the Uruguay Treaty at
http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ38b.pdf.   It seems it only
applies to certain foreign works (non-US) that were previously
considered public domain in the US.

  In case you haven't guessed, I'm thinking about the various include
files in the Linux kernel that SCO has claimed infringes on their
copyrights.  Many of the defines and comments seem to have originated
in Unix Edition 7 and earlier. For example,

errno.h - http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/Nsys/sys/nsys/user.h.html
  and  http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/V5/usr/source/s4/errlst.c.html

signal.h - http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/Nsys/sys/nsys/param.h.html

ioctl.h
ioctls.h -http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/V7/usr/sys/h/tty.h.html

ctype.h - http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/V7/usr/include/ctype.h.html

stat.h - http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/V7/usr/include/sys/stat.h.html
