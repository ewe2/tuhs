Subject: [pups] Sums - help needed
Message-ID: <6TKZbWAPQIy$EwSQ@falstaf.demon.co.uk>

This is rather off topic I know but the people in this group stand a 
good chance of being able to help, so apologies.

Now, I am struggling with the sums involved in Reed Solomon 
encoding/decoding.  Can anyone walk me through a couple of worked 
examples?

Cheers

Robin
