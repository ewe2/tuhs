Um, depends what you mean by thrust. It was originally designed for a  
11/45
where bus activity would have been a fare indication of machine load  
since
all memory and i/o used the unibus (I'm excluding the effects of fastbus
memory on 11/50 and 55's).

The 11/70 unibus was actually slower than the 11/45, and generally  
didn't
have memory or disk/tape i/o on it (separate memory bus and massbus). So
'thrust' was probably mainly character i/o (dh and dz's) and older
disk/tapes (RK05's etc)

Now, where's 11/70 maintenance printset?

Cheers
John
