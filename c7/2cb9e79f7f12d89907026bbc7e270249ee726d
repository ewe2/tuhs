I was told in school (in 1985) that if I was ever lucky enough to have
access to the unix source, I'd find there were no comments. The reason, I
was told at the time, was that comments would make the source code useful,
and selling software was something AT&T couldn't do due to some consent
decree. I've never been able to verify this story, but it came from someone
who started with v5. Sadly, he passed away 15 years ago, or I'd just ask
him again...
