Rewording that, as I recall from Computability Theory there are three 
statements needed for Turing completeness:

   1. S <- 0         S is some var
   2. S <- S + 1
   3. if S=0 goto L  L is some line#

Beyond that everything else is icing on the cake.  Kind of like needing 
nothing more than a bunch of NAND gates to build a computer, 
disregarding practicality...
