wow, systime.

i went for a student placement there but didnt get it - i guess my long hair=
 (then)  didn't fit as the interview seemed good.

i had a mate who was working late on the day the combined uk police and CIA (=
it was said) arrived to shut them down, and tell them they ARE being taken o=
ver by CDC. the crime was selling systime re-badged vaxes to the ussr at the=
 height of the cold war. seem odd now that they thought they could get away w=
ith it.

exciting times.

-Steve
