Announcing the initial release of the XPL to C source translator.

The XPL language is a dialect of PL/I created by McKeeman, Horning and Wortman
and documented in their book "A Compiler Generator" published in 1970.
XPL is a procedural language with structured program flow.  The language
supports integer arithmetic and logical operations.  XPL supports dynamic
string variables and powerful character string manipulation features.

The compiler and the runtime are written in C.  The compiler generates C source
so anyone with a working C compiler can compile and execute code written in XPL.

XPL and the BNF analyzer were the cutting edge of compiler technology 50 years
ago.  This release includes both the compiler and the BNF analyzer written
in the late 60s.
