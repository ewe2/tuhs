This matches my memory as well.  I think I learned C in 1983 or 84,
it just worked.  To me it felt like it was PDP-11 assembler only nicer.
The thing I liked about C is that you always felt like you were right
on the metal, it didn't hide the fact that there was a computer under
it.  Very different feel from, say, Pascal.  I think the fact that you
could feel the machine under the language had a lot to do with it taking
off.

And what Toby said about compilers, oh, man, so true.  Once you got out
in the real world, gcc was buggy and slow, companies wanted to charge
you at every step of the way for compilers that were marginally better
than gcc at best.  When gcc finally got good enough, I agree, around
1990 or so, it was a relief.  You just used it and ignored the platform
specific ones.  G++ took a long time to be good enough.
