fun (sic), I decided to revive the Ratfor (Rational<br />Fortran) preproces=
sor.&nbsp; Please see:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a target=3D"=
_blank" href=3D"https://github.com/arnoldrobbins/ratfor">https://github.com=
/arnoldrobbins/ratfor</a><br /><br />I started with the V6 code, then added=
 the V7, V8 and V10 versions<br />on top of it. Each one has its own branch=
 so that you can look<br />at the original code, if you wish. The man page =
and the paper from<br />the V7 manual are also included.<br /><br />Startin=
g with the Tenth Edition version, I set about to modernize<br />the code an=
d get it to compile and run on a modern-day system.<br />(ANSI style declar=
ations and function headers, modern include files,<br />use of getopt, and =
most importantly, correct use of Yacc yyval and<br />yylval variables.)<br =
/><br />You will need Berkely Yacc installed as byacc in order to build it.=
<br /><br />I have only touch-tested it, but so far it seems OK.&nbsp; 'mak=
e' runs in like 2<br />seconds, really quick. On my Ubuntu Linux systems, i=
t compiles with<br />no warnings.<br /><br />I hope to eventually add a tes=
t suite also, if I can steal some time.<br /><br />Before anyone asks, no, =
I don't think anybody today has any real use<br />for it.&nbsp; This was si=
mply "for fun", and because Ratfor has a soft<br />spot in my heart.&nbsp; =
"Software Tools" was, for me, the most influential<br />programming book th=
at I ever read.&nbsp; I don't think there's a better<br />book to convey th=
e "zen" of Unix.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Arnold</span></span></blockq=
