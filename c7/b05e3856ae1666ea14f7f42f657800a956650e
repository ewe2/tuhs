: Do the Net-2-derived BSDs (including Darwin) really count as Unix-derived?

Yes.

: I thought they were fairly free of AT&T code now, other than headers and
: the like.  Conceptually, of course, they are Unix-derived, but then so
: is Linux.

There's 24 files that have AT&T copyright notice on them that are
still present in the code.  And there's dozens of files in SYS V that
are bsd-derived that now have the proper UCB copyright notice.  The
link to Unix is direct and explicit in the 4.4-lite derived BSDs,
unlike Linux, which has no AT&T code to speak of in it.  Also,
technically speaking, all the BSDs (including Darwin) are 4.4-lite
derived these days, not net-2 derived, since all the projects switched
to 4.4-lite as apart of the ucb/at&t settlement.

See for example from FreeBSD:

: It would be snazzy to restore the classical typography of Unix as

That would be cool.
