To my knowledge, sml/nj was never part of the Unix distribution, though it
was definitely available thereon (and also on SunOS). One of the main people
behind SML/NJ was Dave MacQueen, who was in the same general organization as
the Unix people.

As for sml/nj being too slow to be generally useful, Rob Pike (I think) once
wrote a desk-calculator program in C. I took that program and rewrote it in
sml/nj. Compared to the C version, it ran about twice as slowly and the
source code was about half the size. So no, I don't think sml/nj was slow.
