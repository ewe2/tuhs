It does print "cdecl> " as a prompt on my system.

   $ cdecl
   Type `help' or `?' for help
   cdecl> explain int*()* f
   syntax error
   cdecl> declare f as ptr to function returning ptr to int
   int *(*f)()
   cdecl> ^D
   $ 

However, running it with -q turns this off:

   $ cdecl -q
   declare f as ptr to function returning ptr to int
   int *(*f)()
   ^D
   $ 

The man page for mine says 2.5, Jan 1996, and the Debian package
version says 2.5-11. 1996 in 2017 is old even for Debian.

Are you sure that you don't have a stray alias somewhere, or something
that might be causing it to misdetect as not running in a terminal?
