Deborah,

I'm pretty sure I know the conversation (and I don't believe I was a 
part of it, just read it) and I'm 100% sure nobody intended to be 
rude, they were just trying to get at an accurate history of what
happened.

I can see how you could take offense but I don't think any was intended
and it would be a loss if you left.  Please reconsider.
