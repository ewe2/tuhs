It depends on how it was found in the first place. A quick Google 
doesn't tell me much about exactly how it was discovered initially. Nor 
is there any background information that says it wasn't (or was) 
exploited before the announcement. Was it discovered because someone 
(St√©phane Chazelas) was just reading open source code? Or was he trying 
to do something innocent and it broke in such a way that it was obvious 
bash was doing something bad? Or was he investigating a break-in and 
found the vector? Serious questions, I'd love to hear from anyone who 
knows more.

My original point remains: Open Source doesn't necessarily mean more 
secure if a really bad exploit was allowed to exist for 25 years.

No offense intended to anyone on this list.
