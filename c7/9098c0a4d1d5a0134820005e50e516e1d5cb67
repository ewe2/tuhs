AFAICT 386BSD port started out with 4.3BSD-Tahoe sources.

Jolitz pulled in GCC[1], and Linus would have run into the same 
compiler.
Did Jolitz even have much of a choice back in '89?

[1] - From the original project proposal for 386BSD
3.1. Language tools:

We will base our port on nascent language utilities from RMS's GNU
project (GCC & GAS & LD), which are fairly well fleshed-out but have
never been put to the acid test. Obviously, we will encounter and
bypass and/or fix compiler bugs. Until we find a dedicated compiler
participant who is familiar with GCC, the author will field all
compiler problems and be responsible for fixes and/or workarounds.

We think that GCC is an excellent compiler to work with, and hope that
our use of it will provide FSF with much useful feedback on fixes and
improvements.
