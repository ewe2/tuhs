Actually, I think he was thinking of the application rather than the
whole system.  Was there ever a DIBOL compiler for the PC??  Was there
ever a DIBOL compiler for any non-DEC systems??  Would it be possible
(and maybe even fun) to either write a DIBOL to C translater (like p2c
or f2c) or even a DIBOL front end to GCC??  Would there be any interest
in having DIBOL available again??

I think the above questions should easily show that even though I have
the DIBOL manual and probably even have a copy of the compiler on a tape
somewhere, I have never used or even looked at the language.  I have,
however, heard a lot of comments praising it.
