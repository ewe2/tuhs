Jay Forrester, who invented core memory, first described it in
a lab notebook 65 years ago today.

(Thanks to the Living Computer Museum, through whose Twitter
feed I learned this tidbit.  It's a place--the real museum,
not just the Twitter feed--many on this list might enjoy:
among their aged-but-working computers are a Xerox Star and
a PDP-7.)
