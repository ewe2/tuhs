teco, a very early (even earlier than qed/ed) character based editor, rather a stream editor in unix terms, was written by the student dan murphy for the pdp-1 in around 1964. In the 70ths two teco macro collections were popular in MIT's AI lab: tmacs&temacs, written by gus steele et al., leaving both  packages unmaintained. rms took over maintenance, consolidating and improving them. That's all. He neither written teco nor the teco macro packages.
