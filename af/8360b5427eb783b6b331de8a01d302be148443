Subject: [TUHS] Make love
Message-ID: <1438290719.13422.for-standards-violators@oclsc.org>

My vague memory is that the original make, e.g. in V7, printed
`Don't know how to make love.'  This was not a special case:
`don't know how to make XXX' was the normal message.

There was a variant make that printed
	Not war?
if asked to make love without explicit instructions.  I thought
that appeared in 3BSD or 4BSD, but I could be mistaken.
