Slight disagreement here.  I would say that grep is *a* a tool for JSON and
that jq is *a better* one.  The UNIX model part of this is that jq is another
tool in a toolbox and plays well with others.  What disturbs me about a lot
of software (and my tractor) it when it does the equivalent of throwing a
random metric bolt into something that's built from SAE hardware.
