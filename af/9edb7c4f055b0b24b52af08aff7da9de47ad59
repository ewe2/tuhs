Yeah, DEC did it all in octal.

Look at PDP-11 machine code. Two-op instructions look like this (bit-wise):

  oooossssssdddddd

where 'ssssss' and 'dddddd' (source and destination) have the same format:

  mmmrrr

where 'mmm' is the mode (things like R, @Rn, etc) and 'rrr' is the register
number. All on octal boundaries. So if you see '010011' in a dump (or when
looking at memory through the front console switches :-), you know
immediately that means:

  MOV	R0, @R1

Much harder in hex... :-)
