To be pedantic, if it's POSIX then:
(from http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/)
The contents of the new object shall be the same as that of the old
object prior to deallocation, up to the lesser of the new and old
sizes. Any bytes in the new object beyond the size of the old object
have indeterminate values.
