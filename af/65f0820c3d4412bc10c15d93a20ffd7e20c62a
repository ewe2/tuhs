If we could get DEC/Compaq to allow access to Pro/Venix by UNIX source
license holders, then yes I would certainly add it to the Archive. If
there's no source code, and SCO are happy, then it could go up for anon ftp.

I'm trying to help get the kernel for the version of 2.9BSD ported to the
Pro-350. The patches supplied by Rick Macklem are slightly incomplete, e.g
there is no config shell script which knows about the new device drivers etc.

Anyway, one vital missing file is pcreg.h, which holds the structure
describing the registers of the serial ports on the Pro-350. By perusing
the file dev/pc.c, I've worked out that the struct looks something like:


struct pcdevice {
	??? baud;
	??? cdb;
	??? csa;
	??? csb;
	??? csr;
	??? dbuf;
	??? mc0;
	??? mc1;
	??? mode;
	??? stat;
}

where the fields are not in the correct order, and I have no idea what
C type each is. If anybody can help recreate this file, could they
email me?!

I've included below the C comments at the top of dev/pc.c.

If anybody has Rick Macklem's email address, could they pass that on too?
I will email him and see if he's got a more complete set of patches somewhere.

Many thanks in advance,

	Warren

The UU.SE and gatway.dec.com version of it I ahve running on my PRO-350

I'd like to have SLIP/PPP running on it or even be able to tweek it.

Oh hand I'd say yes.

<As already mentioned in previous messages, I'm working on getting

The F11 does not do I&D split but does have user/system.

It's my understanding that 2.11 will run on F11 systems (pro350 and 11/23)
if properly configured but the only binaries loose are for split I&D.
So if properly configured you can get 2.11 to utilize the user/system
spaces.

Hi -

> From: allisonp at world.std.com (Allison J Parent)
> The F11 does not do I&D split but does have user/system.  

	Correct.  Some systems also have an 18bit only MMU which restricts
	memory to 248kb max (others have a 22bit MMU and can physically
	have more memory).

> It's my understanding that 2.11 will run on F11 systems (pro350 and 11/23)
> if properly configured but the only binaries loose are for split I&D.

	Not likely.  The kernel won't fit in 48kb that I know of.  And there
	will be no networking support since that requires supervisor mode
	which non-split I/D systems don't have.

> So if properly configured you can get 2.11 to utilize the user/system spaces.

	The skeleton of a Makefile for non-split a kernel exists but it 
	will take much work (it is essentially just a list of file that may
	or may not be 100% current) to kick into shape.  Also, remember that
	programs like 'csh', 'vi' and so on are not only split I/D but 
	overlaid - they will not run on a non-split machine.

The DECNA uses one of the earlier Intel network chips.  It lives

I'm going to give up as I seem to remember nothing anymore... sigh.
Allison also sent e-mail saying the DEQNA is not T-11 based.  I guess
I'm thinking of an RQDX3.  I've had no place to unpack my old iron in
over three years and certainly miss being able to pick up the part in
question before foaming at the mouth spouting nonsense. Many apologies
for suggesting such major inaccuracies.  -- Ken

P.S.  Allison describe the DEQNA as a state-driven device with PALs
      (I think) and that "big F" may the the gate array also mentioned.
