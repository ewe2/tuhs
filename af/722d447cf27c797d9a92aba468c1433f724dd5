Hi QingFeng, I think you should join the PUPS mailing list ( see
http://minnie.tuhs.org/mailman/listinfo/pups ), as the people on
the list should be able to answer your questions.

Q1: The source code for V6 init.c is here:
    http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/V6/usr/source/s1/init.c.html

Q2: I would browse through this area of bitsavers.org:
    http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp11/

Hope this helps, and if you have other questions please e-mail them
to the PUPS mailing list, so that we can all help you out.

Cheers,
	Warren
