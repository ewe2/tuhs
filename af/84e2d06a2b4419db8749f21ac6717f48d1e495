True words.

These concepts (what you call abstractions) is no optional geek
pleasure but the most important information for everyone using the
system or language. It's important to teach them, make them explicit,
deal with them, substract points in exams for correct solutions that
have bad style, keep the libraries and books on a high level, ...

This is one of the lesser regarded aspects of what Unix did really
well.
