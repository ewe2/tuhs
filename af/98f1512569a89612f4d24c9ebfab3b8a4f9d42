I played around trying to get the last11c C compiler to work, but no luck
yet. I can compile it using Apout and the existing cc, c0, c1, as binaries.

Tim, I suspect that we need to modify the 0407 patch to also clear the
bss area in core. Here are the headers from several binaries

	    Size of:   text    data    bss
/usr/lib/c0   000407  023324  003574  005700  017614  000000  000000  000001
/usr/lib/c1   000407  016664  011554  003030  010624  000000  000000  000001
/usr/bin/cc   000407  004576  000416  001024  003644  000000  000000  000001
/usr/bin/as   000407  016616  000000  000000  000000  000000  000000  000001
/usr/bin/size 000407  002626  000000  000000  000000  000000  000000  000001

You can see that c0, c1 and cc all have bss areas, but as and size have no
bss areas, which is probably why they work OK.

Cheers,
