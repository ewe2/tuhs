Some people mentioned it being out of print.  I was wondering, has anyone
tried purchasing it from

    http://www.peer-to-peer.com/catalog/opsrc/lions.html

They don't seem to have any indication on the web site that it is out of
print, and they have a link to it from their home page
(http://www.peer-to-peer.com/).
