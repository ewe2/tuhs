Ah, yes, now that you point it out, I see the sorting in the RP driver.

It looks that way, yes.  The fact that it does a synchronous write of
the superblocks at the start of the sync seems to imply that two
successive calls should ensure a proper flushing of everything, and may
even have been written like that with that effect in mind, but once disk
drivers started optimizing I/O ordering, the effect was lost - which
might just be why the synchronous superblock write was gone in V7.
