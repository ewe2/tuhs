Um, so there were 3: 386, Net and Free.  That's already 2 too many.

So I had a successful commercial product that ran on all of those variants
without issue.  I supported linux on everything from ARM to IBM's z-system
mainframes and all the arches inbetween.  I think I have one #ifdef SPARC
in there because there was a cache flush bug but that was a hardware issue,
not a software issue.

I also supported {Free,Net,Open}BSD and I had way more problems with them
than I did with Linux.

There is one kernel development stream that matters.  RedHat knows that
if they don't get their stuff into Linus' tree, they have a nightmare
on their hands.  That's why RedHat paid so many of the kernel developers.

Sure, there are forks, but there is one tree that matters, and that is 
Linus' tree.  You can't say that about BSD and that is the problem in
it's entirety.  If I want to change BSD, which one?

For me, I gave up when there was no longer one BSD, there was one Linux.
