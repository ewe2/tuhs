I should have been more clear. The Unix history Git repository contains 
synthetic commits imported from snapshots, patches, SCCS, CVS, and Git 
files. I took the liberty of attaching the email ID at research.uucp on all 
Bell Labs commits, even though many predate UUCP email.

Your SCCS work belongs to the mysterious subset of Bell Labs commands 
that made their first public appearance on BSD Unix. I didn't find SCCS 
included in the 6th or 7th Research Edition, nor in Unix 32/V, which, I 
understand, were the ancestors of BSD.

Specifically, I first find SCCS included in the BSD-4 snapshot (e.g. 
usr.bin/sccs/sccs.c) and also in the BSD SCCS repositories predating 
BSD-4, through commits such as the following.

commit 20f9634be56fa471a34bc386dcc4c04f9587791d
Author: Eric Allman <eric at ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU>

changed path to SCCS/s.
added chghist & help
generalized argument chomping

SCCS-vsn: 1.2


Other commands that fall into this category include fsck (frodo), gres 
(lem), efl (sif), diction (llc), and ideal (cvw). Somebody has commented 
on this list that a secret tunnel linked Murray Hill and Berkeley. I'd 
welcome any better explanations you may have.


I'll find a way to graft you as the developer of SCCS somewhere between 
BSD3 and BSD4, so please do claim marc at research.uucp on GitHub.  Are 
there other files I should also attribute to you?
