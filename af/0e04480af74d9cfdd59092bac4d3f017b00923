Exactly.  He is the true father of UNIX.
I always admired Ken's passion for minimalism and elegant, simple solutions
to IT problems.  Ed(1) will always be the most beautiful editor ever
written.

Besides Go I have not seen him getting involved with other projects
recently though and the world needs him now more than ever...

Linux and FreeBSD are now two monstrous trolls, bloated and extremely
complex and large.

Plan 9 is dead.  MINIX is dying too...

It seems UNIX fate is doomed.  The only last remaining production quality
UNIX that still maintains minimalism as one of its goals is probably
OpenBSD these days...

I am glad Rob and Ken gave us Go.  It breathed a new life into the complex
world of writing software.

Happy Birthday, Ken.
