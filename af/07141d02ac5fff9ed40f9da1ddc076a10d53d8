Subject: [TUHS] Downloadable Usenet groups?
Message-ID: <20111201224509.GA15471@minnie.tuhs.org>

Also, is there a place where I can download archives of Usenet groups
in a plain text format? I think I've got v6.bugs and v7.bugs and some
of comp.sources.unix. I just came across net.unix on Google Groups,
but I'd rather not have to wget all that HTML!

Thanks,
	Warren
