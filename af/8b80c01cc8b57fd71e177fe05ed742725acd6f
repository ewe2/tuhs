As early as V5 the (thompson) shell prompts were “#” and “%”, and “:” for
a label. As the goto command exists in V4 (there is a man page for it), I
would assume that those characters were used in V4 as well. So it would
seem to go back to 1974.

In the V7 (bourne) shell the default non-root prompt is “$”. Goto is
dropped at this point.

Don’t know when or where “>” was first used on Unix as a prompt character
(on my boxes it still is “$”).
