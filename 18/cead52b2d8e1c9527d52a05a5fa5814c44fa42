It turns out the original FORTRAN (manual published in October 1956; code first shipped around April 1957) included the arithmetic IF as well as the assigned and computed GOTO statements â€” see chapter 4 of this manual:

J.W. Backus, R.J. Beeber, S. Best, R. Goldberg, H.L. Herrick, R.A. Hughes, L.B. Mitchell, R.A. Nelson, R. Nutt, D. Sayre, P.B. Sheridan, H. Stern, I. Ziller.

Applied Science Division and Programming Research Department, International Business Machines Corporation, October 15, 1956, 51 pages.
