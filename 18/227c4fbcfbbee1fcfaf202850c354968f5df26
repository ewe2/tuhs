The issue of a.out magic numbers came up.   The a.out header was 16 =
bytes.    The first two bytes was 0407 in the original code.    This was =
followed by 16 bit quantities for text, data, and bss sizes.   Then the =
size of the symbol tables.   I'm pretty sure the rest of the fields were =
blank in V6.   Later a start address (previously always assumed to be =
zero) was added.

The number 407 was a neat kludge.   It was a (relative) branch =
instruction on the PDP-11.   0400 was the base op code.  7 referred to =
jumping ahead 7 words which skipped you over the a.out header (the PC =
had already been incremented for the branch instruction itself).    This =
allowed you to make a boot block without having to strip off the header. =
  Boot blocks were just one 512 byte block loaded from block zero of the =
disk into low memory.

Later executables used 410 for a write protected text segment and 411 =
for split-I/D executables.   Later versions added more codes (413 was =
used in BSD to indicate aligned pages followed etc...   Even later =
systems coded the hardware type into the magic number to distinguish =
between different architectures.

Note that the fact that 410 and 411 were also PDP-11 branch instructions =
wasn't ever really used for anything.
