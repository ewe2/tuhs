See 4.0BSD /usr/src/sys/newsys/sys1.c
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4BSD/usr/src/sys/newsys/sys1.c
for two mails from Dennis to Berkeley, sending the info and code.

I tried to follow all the traces of #! and collected the results on
http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/
I'd be happy to add and fix stuff, if somebody spots anything.

Warren, one has to be careful not to have trailing slashes in web archive URLs.
(e.g., after modifying URLs by hand). Example: calling
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4BSD/usr/src/sys/
eventually results in the link
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4BSD/usr/src/sys//sys/TODO
which yields "...is not a known file.", while
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4BSD/usr/src/sys/sys/TODO
is valid.
