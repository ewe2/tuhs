Oh sure! Sorry; the mention of the 4K data section was meant to be
orthogonal to the empty-shell file thing. However, one still cannot
'exec' an empty shell script, even on OS X:

: hurricane; mkdir t
: hurricane; cd t
/Users/dcross/t
: hurricane; touch true
: hurricane; cat>dotrue.c
int main() { execl("./true", "true", 0); write(2, "Boo\n", 4); return 1; }
: hurricane; chmod +x ./true
: hurricane; ./true
: hurricane; echo $?
0
: hurricane; make dotrue

(The system-provided /usr/bin/true is >16KB!!)
