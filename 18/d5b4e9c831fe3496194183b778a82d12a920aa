What I seem to remember is that it was a trick used in BSD to achieve 
compatibility with SystemV shell scripts (the shell on System-V would
understand [ .. ] but the one on BSD wouldn't and making [ a symlink
to test would fix the problem).

My copy of Portable C and UNIX system programming only mentions that
the [ .. ] construct may be missing on some shell versions and this
can usually be fixed by symlinking [ to test.

A hardlink from /bin/[ to /bin/test was present on Ultrix since at 
least 3.1, which would also attest to the BSDism or workaround for
non-System-V systems. Sorry, this is too far back in time for my 
feeble memory.
