Based on that extra info I think you have a later version of Network Unix, which
is still wonderful and exciting.

The initial 1975 implementation was - in the authors' recollection - only some
one to two thousand lines of extra kernel code and one thousand for the NCP
daemon. That would make for some 50 pages of printout. It is possible.

I know the Kelley document well and sections 5 and 6 contain a fairly
detailed code walkthrough. Perhaps this is what lingered in your memory.
I suspect this (Oct 1978) code walkthrough will match with the code on your
tape.
