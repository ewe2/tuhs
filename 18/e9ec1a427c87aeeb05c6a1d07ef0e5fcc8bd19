Subject: [pups] 2.11BSD Patch 445; FPSIM fixed;
	211bsd runs on systems without FPP
Message-ID: <459BF364.8010602@gsi.de>

A note to all 2.11bsd users:

Some time ago I looked into running 2.11bsd on systems without
floating point unit. The release notes state that this is untested
and unsupported, and indeed it didn't work.

Robin Birch some time ago fixed part of the issues, see patch 434,
but still the kernel paniced when the very first program was started.
I managed to localize and fix the problem in sys/pdp/mch_fpsim.s.

Steven Schultz right away issued 2.11BSD patch #445. All patches
up to and including 445 are provided by Steven under

   ftp://sg-1.ims.ideas.gd-ais.com/pub/2.11BSD

A patch level 445 system will now boot on simh for example on a

   set cpu 11/70 nofpp 4m

configuration and work just fine, albeit a little slower.

It should thus also work on a real 11/70 without FPP. I heard
of some 11/70 with non-working FPP's, so this maybe good news
for the owners.


			With best regards,

				Walter Mueller
