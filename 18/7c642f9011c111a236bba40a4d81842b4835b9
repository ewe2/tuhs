Dave Yost wrote the serial driver for our 4 port serial card @ Fortune
(1981-82).  Later chips like NS16550 had 16 char on chip buffers but we
back then we used a Moto SIO chip that had only one char buffer.  IIRC,
he used two tricks. One was "partially evaluated" xmit/recv handlers so
that each port got its own xmit/recv functions, with hand-crafted
instructions (in hex, no less!) just right for a given port and all the
interry t handler . The  do was transfer a char from/to the buffer it
(lready knew about. The other was he increased the cblock size from 8 to 128
(what a clist points to). He says he described this design to dmr who said
why not?!  With this design Yost's code was able to handle 4 full-duplex
9600 baud streams at full-speed. Not bad for a 5.6Mhz clock machine!
