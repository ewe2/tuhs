The same is true for the more recent Unix variants, modulo a few special
cases such as Larry mentions, but broadly speaking userland and the kernel
are still separated.

You mean like the Web?  :-)

In 2000-2005 I wrote a substantial quasi-batch application that supported
$EMPLOYER's main product and was written about half in shell scripts and
half in Perl, or more accurately entirely in shell scripts, but if I needed
a pipeline component that wasn't already available in SunOS or as
third-party open source, I wrote it in Perl.  (There was a single 10-line C
program to eliminate a performance bottleneck.)  So the application as a
whole was full of hard boundaries across which nothing could pass except
text streams; I found that this added substantially to its debuggability
and maintainability.
