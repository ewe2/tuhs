RMS credits Multics Emacs with the idea to use Lisp as the extension
language:

    The language that you build your extensions on shouldn't be thought
    of as a programming language in afterthought; it should be designed
    as a programming language. In fact, we discovered that the best
    programming language for that purpose was Lisp.

    It was Bernie Greenberg, who discovered that it was. He wrote a
    version of Emacs in Multics MacLisp, and he wrote his commands in
    MacLisp in a straightforward fashion. The editor itself was written
    entirely in Lisp. Multics Emacs proved to be a success great
    programming new editing commands was so convenient that even the
    secretaries in his office started learning how to use it.
