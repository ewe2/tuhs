To be fair, this is basically what modern software development in

Find someone who=E2=80=99s interested and talk to them?  I mean, that=E2=80=
=99s kinda what
this list is, right?

The other part: it=E2=80=99s historically been a crap shoot whether the CS
department at any given place came out of EE, in which case it was the
bottom-up here=E2=80=99s a transistor, and here=E2=80=99s a flip-flop, and,=
 look, logic
gates!  Adders!  Et cetera, or it came out of the math department and is a
theory-heavy specialization of some very particular parts of discrete
mathematics and combinatorics.
