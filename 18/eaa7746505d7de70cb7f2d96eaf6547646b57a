​I have never heard that justification.   It's always been talked about as
the "loader" communications I had with different folks including Dennis.
In the early/mid '70s the person that introduced me to Unix (tjk) always
called it the loader.​   Ted was (like many of us in those days) coming
from either IBM's TSS or MTS, and influenced by IBM's terminology as well
as DECs.

​I used TSS/8 and I've forgotten what is was called there, never used
OS/8.  In TOPS and Tenex land it was called a linker, as it was on TSS and
MTS.

​As the author of VMS's link and later versions, I'll try to ask Paul
tomorrow what he knows/remembers.  In my presence, he has b*tched about
Unix calling it a 'loader.​
