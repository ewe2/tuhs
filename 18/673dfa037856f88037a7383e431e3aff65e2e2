​You're right of course.  I was referring more to the fact that changes
tended to be an issue​.

I always give Dave Clark credit (what I call "Clark's Observation") for the
most powerful part of the replacement for the ARPAnet - aka the idea of a
network of network.   Dave once quipped:  "Why does a change at CMU have to
affect MIT?"  I've forgotten what we did at CMU at the time, but I remember
the MIT folk were not happy about it.

​Right.

Thanks, ​I never knew that.  Makes sense.

​Thought, didn't you guys have the 3Mbit stuff like we did at CMU and UCB
first?  ​

​Hey when we did it, we were trying to a UNIX machine to talk to CDC Cyber
and an VMS/VAX.   No routers.  We were happy to just have those systems
communicating ;-)

I was not smart enough to see something like ARP - which later seemed like
such a D'oh moment.

Then again -- at the time 48 bits of Ethernet was supposed to me "enough"
and you were not going to need anything else.  Funny how it all worked out.​
