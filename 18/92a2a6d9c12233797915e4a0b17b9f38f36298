Subject: [TUHS] Solaris 10 source code
Message-ID: <42B3B2F4.4070503@peacemax.org>

To all the Unix Officiando's,

    Have any of you checked out the recent release of Sun's Solaris 10 
source code known as OpenSolaris?

    What are your thoughts on the subject?

    Is the source code still considered to be based on SVR4?

     Any likely chance of using Solaris source code to bring 32V or 
Version 7 of  Unix into the modern world of x86 usage?

Thank you,
James Falknor
