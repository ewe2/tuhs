Warren,
False alert... Ultrix-11 V3.1 source tape file is NOT corrupted.  My WinZIP
was - I use NT at work, download stuff, and take it home with me, to load onto
the Unix machines. The Unix boxes have no problem with the files...

Hi all, I'm back from holidays. With regards to corrupt files in the
UNIX Archive, yes it looks like I have had a few hit. I'll check through
my old backups for a clean version of Ken Wellsch's 6th Edition disk image.

There is a checksums file in the archive: /checksums, with MD5 checksums
for all files. If you do suspect a file is damaged, please check to see
if the MD5 checksum matches that in the /checksums file.

Also, has anybody tried out the VTserver 2.0 alpha program?! I'm going to
be flat out here at work for a month or two, but I will try to add support
for things other than plain copying of disk images.

Cheers,
	Warren
