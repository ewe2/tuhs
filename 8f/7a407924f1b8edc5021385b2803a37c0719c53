Likewise.  And on a related subject, FreeBSD dropped its Alpha support
(from the development branch) earlier this week - it had fallen below
critical mass - and a lot of this would have been the death of the
underlying chip.

From it's start I was very impressed with it.  It was a very good RISC

I can't think of any other architecture where the designers considered
what they needed to do to make the architecture future-proof.  The
normal architectural design criteria are a mixture of the number of
transistors they can fit on a chip today and backward compatibility.

It's effectively end-of-life.  There will be no future releases, though
HP will support it until about 2011.

If Linux and *BSD aren't Unix, how do you define Unix?  (Other than
having paid TOG the trademark licensing fees).

That is a surprise to you?

There's a bit of a feedback loop: Starting with the IBM-PC, x86 sold
in large volumes, so there were lots of profits and design costs could
be amortised over a larger volume, allowing more man-hours to be
invested in the next generation whilst still returning a profit.  This
makes the next generation of x86 outperform the competition at a lower
price - encouraging more people to use x86.

I suspect the IA-64 will quietly fade away.  It hasn't lived up to the
hype and even Intel seem to acknowledge this by licensing the amd64.

SMP support started earlier than 4.1.4.  The sun4m machines (SS470,
SS670) were the first SMP machines and ISTR they were supported in
the last 4.0.x or early 4.1.x releases.  (I was using them at the
time but the details have faded a bit after 15 years).

Most early SMP systems worked this way - it's relatively easy to
implement and gives good CPU utilisation on CPU-intensive tasks (that
don't need the kernel much).
