Definitely. Like how most compilers do - the caller cleans the stack 
afterwards, if we have a system where a variable number of arguments are 
allowed and not indicated in other ways. Not to mention explicit 
cleaning up of the stack in the function before the return as well.

Probably not. This ties in with an old (urban) myth about the PDP-11.

The MARK instruction was not in the basic, original instruction set. It 
came about in one of the extensions that were done. And one story behind 
it was that it was "invented" in order to copyright, or somehow protect 
the instruction set for a few years more.
(I think it came at the same time as SOB, and the EIS stuff, but I don't 
remember for sure...)
