The C compiler we had at NMT that Greg Titus wrote/rewrote allowed one to
pick a number
of different choices for character size (5, 6, 7 or 8). It defaulted to 7
or 8. I recall that the
defaults produced OK results for student work, but that was a bit slow for
pushing the
envelope without some very careful choices. But it was good enough for me
to write
my OS group project running under 'ZAYEF' a DecSystem-20 emulator running
on the
DecSystem 20 under TOPS-20... My first exposure to virtual machines... It
was a total
trip to have 18 bit pointers and weird interrupt semantics....

I really rather working on the VAX 11/750 in 'C' and later on the Sun3/50s
more, though.
In part because the debugger was better (or at least more approachable by m=
y
poor undergraduate mind).
