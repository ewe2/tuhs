Subject: [TUHS] 32I: spl*() and paging up
Message-ID: <3FC96E2B.1030200@monmouth.com>

A quick update.

I have spl*() code as well as ia32 paging up in a small test kernel. 
More testing remains to be done before integrating into 32I kernel. 
Interrupt structure working well, as well as system call interface.

Still need copyin(), copyout(), fubyte(), fuibyte(), fuword(), etc., as 
well as save(), resume(), etc.

Future progress will slow down a little.  I have accepted an adjunct 
teaching position, and will need to devote some otherwise free time to 
preparing lessons.  I still expect to have a preliminary running kernel 
by New Years.
