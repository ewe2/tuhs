You might laugh, but when I worked at Tektronix on their workstation product,
they had a group that actually did that, or at least as close as possible.  I
remember them agonizing over fixing cpile bugs in eqn.  Was actually really
nice to have a pretty bug-free system available.  But, in the tried and true
bad management style that was Tektronix, nobody every asked whether there was
any customer value proposition.
