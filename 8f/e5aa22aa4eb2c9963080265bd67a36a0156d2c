Probably an incorrect memory.  Of course, in an edge-labeled general
graph, directories don't have names any more than files do in modern
Unix filesystems, so it isn't "what's its name?", it is "what's its
name in some directory?"

I assume you know about
https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html , which is an essential
resource on Ancientest Unix.  Note especially the absence of any way to
create directories while the system is running.
