One of the original references was from the proceedings of an AUUG
conference.  From personal experience I can confirm that the level of
review for the conferences fell far short of what USENIX did.

Yes, that last sentence was my update.  As I mentioned in an earlier
message, I think that it's appropriate that it should stay, if only to

But it would be nice to be able to remove the [better source needed].
It seems that there's only one person objecting to the changes.  I've
asked him on the talk page what he really wants.
