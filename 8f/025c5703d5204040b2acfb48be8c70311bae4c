Speaking of DG/UX, anybody know where to find this article?

M. H. Kelley.  A look at the DG/UX file system.
Technical Report 3, Data General Corporation, 1990

I have a feeling DG was very early with journaling / crash resistant
filesystem tech but I've seen almost no detailed info, just a couple of 
lines in a brochure.
