Thanks,

those are the patch kits, Mario.  You grab a system, then patch it
up to 'current' with those patches.

I expected something like that - any idea where to grab a system?

Every now and then, a kind sould releases a fully 'current' system.

Are there any old <fully 'current' systems> around? 
Has anybody tried to run it on an emulator?
