4BSD (4.0) usr/src/sys/sys/TODO (of Nov.  9, 1980) says it was planned:

	6. Exec fixes
        	Implement dmr's #! feature; pass string arguments through 
		faster.

And the usr/src/sys/newsys/sys1.c has explanation of it and source code.

This seems to indicate the idea was not developed separately at 
Berkeley.

It was introduced into BSD by April 1981. For 2BSD (2.8) it was added by 
Dec. 16, 1981 when built with MENLO_SCRIPT defined (but I don't see that 
documented or defined).
