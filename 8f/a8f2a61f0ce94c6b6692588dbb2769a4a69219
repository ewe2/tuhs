I=E2=80=99m still not clear on why you think acme is a bad citizen. If anyth=

makes its windows more accessible to other tools. Unlike emacs or vim
or any IDE. What could acme have differently or what other editor is
not a =E2=80=9Cbad citizen=E2=80=9D.

Composability is implicitly the key point in =E2=80=9Cthe Unix way=E2=80=9D b=
ut typically
editors are not very composable. Or composable in a different domain.
Similarly GUI. Once you add a human in your composition, further
composability falls apart! A human being the ultimate =E2=80=9Cdo everything=
=E2=80=9D
kitchen sink:-)

The question is what can be done to improve composability beyond the
=E2=80=9CUnix way=E2=80=9D or plan9 way.=
