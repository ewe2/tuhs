I know I'm well within my rights to port the code.  I've kept copies of 
the license and modified the sources I'm working on to include the 
Caldera license, BSD style.  The only potential problem is that it may 
be a lightning rod and I could loose permission to complete the project.

Just thought I'd pass along the latest SCO craziness.
