Why not? If there's enough backing store availble?

Note that many systems demand page-in the code section straight out of the
executable, so if some of those pages aren't needed, they can just
be released.  And said pages can be shared among all processes running
the same executable, for further savings.

It depends upon the system. Some had pageable page tables, which is
pretty hairy. Others didn't. I don't remember what 4BSD did on the
Vax, but I suspect that the page tables and enough info to find everything
on swap stayed in kernel memory.  (Where's Chris Torek when you need
him? :-)

But yes, swapping was generally used to free up large amounts of memory
if under heavy load.
