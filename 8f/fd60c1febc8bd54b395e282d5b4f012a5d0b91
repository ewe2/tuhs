I was in my late teens around that time but I got the impression that in
the early to mid 1990s when this shift was happening, networking was
moving to IP and all the IP software was Unix - certainly it was the only
option if you wanted to run network services at the scale of a University
or ISP. At the same time Windows was all about workgroup-scale office
networking. I don't think their network protocols were OSI but Exchange
was based on X.400 and to this day still only does Internet mail
grudgingly.
