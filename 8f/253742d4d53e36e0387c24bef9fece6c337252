Most - if not all - the AOS work was done by Roger Florkowski and Mark
Dapoz, and Roger was definitely working for IBM at that time.

I think time was limiting factor, but also Roger was not really wanting
to port the Mach VM to AOS due to the RT MMU limitations - in
particular, there is no way for multiple virtual addresses to point to
the same page, so you need to keep evicting/switching mappings when you
want a page to be available to the kernel and the currently running
userland process. That was fixed in the POWER MMU.

I'm afraid that doesn't ring any bell.
