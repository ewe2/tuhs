Hi -

	Good Idea because the default is only suitable for single user mode
	and building a new/custom kernel.   Quite a few kernel tables
	are sized based on 'maxusers' - in particular the coremap and swapmap
	tables (which track the fragments of memory and swap space) will be
	exhausted easily if you bring up a network'd kernel and start up
	the various daemons.

	It really doesn't - not having UMRs to deal with is a Nice Thing about 
	the Qbus ;)   The kernel (and the standalone utilities of course)
	need to know if they're on a U or Q-bus system but once a Q system
	is found then the UMR handling is bypassed.

	Cheers,
