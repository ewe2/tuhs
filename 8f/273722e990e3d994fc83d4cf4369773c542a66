Why does it matter?  A rose by any other name....

I will observe that people who are insisting on Linux and how it
should be named usually have some kind of agenda.  Take for example,
someone who tried to rename Linux as GNU/Linux.

For people who want to insist that Linux is not Unix; that's fine.  I
usually like to yank their chain by saying, tongue in cheek, that
sure, Linux is not Unix, but it is largely compatible with Legacy Unix
systems.  :-)
