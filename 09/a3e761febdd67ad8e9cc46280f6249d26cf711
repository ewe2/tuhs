Subject: [TUHS] What UNIX on a PDP-11/34 ?
Message-ID: <20051108223406.GA10659@freaknet.org>


Hi all, 

here at freaknet medialab we made some images of our
RL02 disk packs with RT-11 and GAMMA-11 software 
(specific for a Nuclear Camera, this pdp-11 was used
for medical exams) :)

those images are very funny, we can use them under
simh emulator! :)

So, now that we have the backups, we're wondering about
installing UNIX in this pdp11/34.

what can we install? any hint ? 

please help! :)

p.s. something about our restoration and the disk image of
our rt-11 system is online at http://zaverio.net/pdp11, under
the "stuff" directory. :)
