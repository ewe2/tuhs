Seconded... At a past life, we had a SONET circuit that we were using for
timing signals, but needed some way to do networking... The timing signals
and driver chips we were using precluded using the front door, so we used
the 1-byte service field per frame to do PPP, which we did have access to
(and was the only data field we had access to).
