Like I pointed out, RFC760 lacks ICMP. Error messaging was supposed to 
be carried in IP options. That is more than an editorial change.

Packet format, yes. Semantics and operations differed. ICMP didn't even 
exist.

Depending on how you defined "well", people might still argue about 
that. :-)

I would seriously question that, if nothing based on just my comments 
about ICMP above.

Anyway, let's dig a bit more then, shall we...

RFC 762 is "Assigned numbers". There you will find that the IP version 
field in the IP header values. Version 4 was defined in August 1979, 
with a reference to: "Postel, J. "DOD Standard Internet Protocol," 
IEN-128, USC/Information Sciences Institute, January 1980."

Which also makes one question how anyone would have known about IPv4 in 
1978.

Also, first definition of TCP shows up in RFC 761, which is also 
IEN-129. And that is the DoD standard. Also dated January 1980.

Another rather interesting document is RFC 801, which lists the current 
status of TCP/IP implementations in appendix D. This document is from 
November 1981, and there it is clearly stated which implementations 
exist at that point (that the authors know about). And it's for the most 
part very much "work in progress". And this is at the end of 1981...

So yes, I still have problems with claims that they had it all running 
in 1978. :-)

I don't really agree with your view on the RFCs here. :-)

Yes, except of course, those documents aren't really that much earlier 
in some cases, like ones I pointed out above, which I think are most 
relevant here...
