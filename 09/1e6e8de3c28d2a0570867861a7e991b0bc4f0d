I was a sysadmin at the time at Emory U's computing center. We were very
fortunate to have the worm bypass us, since we were running a sendmail.cf
file that I had written (from scratch!) instead of the standard one.

(It was written using Ease, a preprocessor for sendmail.cf files. It
took me a long time to write and test.  I have, fortunately, literally,
forgotten more about sendmail than most people ever know. :-)

Anyway, I came in that Monday morning to business as usual, only to
hear about the chaos happening in the rest of the Unix world. :-)

I am sure, now, that I totally didn't understand then how really
lucky we were.
