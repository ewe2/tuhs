I'm guessing by this you files like /dev/fd/42.

There's a historical disconnect here. Setuid scripts were disabled in
the mid- to late 80s.  /dev/fd didn't hit the commercial Unix world
until SVR4 in 1989, and didn't get into the other systems you mention
until even later.

So yes, that might have worked, but the solution came along too late.
