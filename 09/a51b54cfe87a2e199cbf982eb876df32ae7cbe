Your request set me on a chase of my own. I found a dated message by Bob 
Drzyzgula praising e and giving in turn the web address of the current
maintainer.

As it turns out this page at CERN was no longer accessible, so I contacted
Bob asking if he still kept any copy. Meanwhile I tried as well to contact
the current maintainer, Fabien Perriollat and he in turn managed to get
his account at CERN unblocked.

To cut a long story short: RAND E is alive and well, being maintained by
Fabien Perriollat at CERN. The address is

	http://perrioll.home.cern.ch/perrioll/Rand_Editor/

and there you will find both the sources and executables for AIX, Linux,
Lynx OS, Solaris and Windows95.

Best regards,
