Subject: [TUHS] 2018: eighteen months to the Unix 50th anniversary
Message-ID: <20180109003018.GB29792@minnie.tuhs.org>

Hi all, Happy New Year. As it's now only eighteen months to the Unix 50th 
Anniversary, I thought I'd poll you all to get an update of what is being
done to celebrate the anniversary, and/or what could we organise that has
not yet been organised.

Cheers, Warren
