 From "Casting the Net":

In 1976, Mike Lesk at Bell Labs came up with a program called UUCP—“UNIX 
to UNIX
copy.” UUCP enabled users to send mail, transfer files, and execute 
remote commands. Lesk
first called it a “scheme for better distribution” (Mini-Systems 
Newsletter, January 1977); but
only a month later it was referred to as UUCP. First designed to operate 
over 300 baud lines,
UUCP was finally published in February 1978.

UUCP was taken up widely and this led to a need for improvements. The 
next version was
written by Lesk and Dave Nowitz, with contributions by Greg Chesson, and 
appeared in
Seventh Edition UNIX in October 1978.
