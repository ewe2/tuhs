It contains Features from CB Unix but was not the same thing.  In particular shared memory and semaphores were contributed by Dale’s team but it was PWB 3.0 that was rebranded system III and then updated and released by USG aka summit eventually as sys V.   System IV was not released outside the bell system I’m not sure if it ever went out inside. 

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.
