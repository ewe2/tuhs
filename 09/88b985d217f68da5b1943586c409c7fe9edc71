With spdx it would go in neither place.. spdx is prescriptive about where
the bom and such resides.

But one of the big issues with thus stuff is things like USENIX tapes and
other similar artifacts that have unclear or no license data still extant
from the time, if there ever was. Or licenses that are poorly crafted. Some
items have good and clear title, but many do not.  Unix itself has an
unclear chain of ownership at the time the ancient licenses were granted,
especially in light of rulings in some court cases (some of which conflict
in their finer points). We likely do not want to be in the business of
judging things beyond "we have a good faith basis to think we can
distribute this"

So anything that goes beyond the simple spdx stuff, with our own extensions
makes me nervous.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyway, WRT to TUHS, I&#39;m thinking that at least in the ca=

And maybe add a<br>

&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Then update the README in the current top-level dir.=C2=A0 =
=C2=A0Adding to the<br>
