I won't disagree with you.

I remember that stateful vs. stateless was one of the big technical
debates of the time, and I remember that (my impression of) the general
feeling was that stateful was better but much harder to do / get right.
(Again, I don't want to start another long thread over this, especially
as I don't really remember any more than what I just wrote.)

So we can downgrade "stateful" from "good" to "different" and let
it go at that. :-)

Thanks,
