My mail/web server is FreeBSD (of course), which is self-firewalled; that 
latter task will soon be taken over by OpenBSD (of course).

The main client is a MacBook running Sierra (the poxy thing doesn't seem 
to like High Sierra), as FreeBSD for all its advantages is a piss-poor 
client.

I have images of NetBSD etc lying around somewhere, to try on new boxen.

And I keep a tame Debian laptop to see what the penguins have broken on my 
projects[*]...

I was calling Linux that a fair while before OSX came along.

[*]
Just one example: it's 'stty -f ..." on most systems, but "stty -F" on 
Penguin/OS.  Why?
