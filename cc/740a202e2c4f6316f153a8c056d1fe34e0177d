As Neil Young said when he played with the band, it's been of one of
the great joys of my life to be here with you (yeah, I paraphrased).

As a kid who wanted to be at Bell Labs, a student who got the troff
manual and used it for the next 30 years, a student who got an account
on the vax 11/750 that had the BSD source on it and learned so much,
I just want to thank all of the Bell Labs people for being here and
Warren for putting this list together and for Unix teaching me so much.

If I could have one thing for Christmas it would be bwk joining the list.
I did some extensions to awk and asked him about it and he tarred up
~bwk/awk and sent it to me.  I've got the awk source and the book source
in english and french (I think).  Brian is awesome, it would be cool to
have him on this list.

All that said, I super grateful to be here amongst the people who were 
there when you got an image from Ken.  You guys are lucky.
