I recall that Cutler wanted a portable OS and had a cli version running 
on MIPS first.  Eventually, Gates ordered a GUI "bolted on" and things

Indeed, but it was functionally useless in that it could interact with 
the NT system.  It always reminds of the time that NT obtained FIPS 140 
Level 1 but with no network. (Had NIST not re-organised their website, I 
would link to the certificate.)
