Thanks - do you know what FreeBSD version it last worked on?  Also,
which 
version of P11 you are using?  I'm not doing anything significant with
the FreeBSD
box (it's a virtual machine under VMware) so re-installing is not a
problem.

Could you let me know the FreeBSD and Begemot P11 versions you were
using? (Anyone
else who has a working combination, feel free to jump in!)

Thanks very much for the config file, that should make life a lot
easier... And
thanks for all your efforts in updating 2.11BSD - very impressive to get
a full
fledged BSD system on a PDP-11!

Cheers

Richard
