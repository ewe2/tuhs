Yes, this was the problem I was asking about.  Plus the even more vexing
problem of time discontinuity when the train is already en route.

I can still remember the days of thick bound paper schedules in Europe,
and I think for overnight routes there usually was a tiny footnote
about the 2 critical days.  New book schedules were issued each year so
the footnotes could be specific about the dates.  What I don't know is
how this transitioned into the digital age.
