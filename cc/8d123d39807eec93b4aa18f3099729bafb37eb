That last one is a gotcha waiting to happen:

program --this-is-the-long-option

is the same as 

program --this

but that will break scripts (and fingers) when program gets a new 
option like

program --this-is-the-even-longer-option

We wrote our own getopt() for BitKeeper and it had long and short options
but no gotcha unique prefix.
