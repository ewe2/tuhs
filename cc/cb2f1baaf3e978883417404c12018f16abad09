I was going to say it was total and complete BS, at least based on the 
quoted statement in the initial email. But I decided not to send it. ;)

I wrote a POSIX thread based queuing system a few years back that could 
handle thousands of threads on a dual processor SPARC-10 before it just 
completely locked up Solaris (I think 9). It was targeted at larger 
systems, and it could easily scale as far as I wanted it to.

While you could argue that pthreads are not "C", the language was quite 
happy doing what I asked of it.

Sometimes, I wonder... Programmers are supposed to be smarter than the 
language. Not the other way around.
