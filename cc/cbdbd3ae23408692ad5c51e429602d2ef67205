Firstly, many thanks.  I've downloaded it, and will get on to it right away.

Re: Command laguage - judging from what the book "The Architecture of 
Concurrent Programs" says, I always assumed that the job control language was 
pascal itself,  eg, pg 70, 71:

"if the user forgets which programs are available, he may for example type:
	help
(or anything else).  The system responds by writing
	not executable, try
	list(catalog, seqcode, console)
The suggested command lists the names of all sequential programs on the 
console."

"Still more information about a program can be gained by reading its manual
	copy(readman, console)
"
and, pg 75:

"The program does not know whether it is being called by another program or 
directly from the console."

Thus like the LispMachine, the operating system is user-extensible.

If it's any help, I've got the book, and it does contain a brief section on 
usage - I'm sure I could make a valid case for Fair Use if I copied the user 
HOWTO out and posted it on my web site as a HOWTO for anyone as interested as 
me in Concurrent Pascal and Solo - understanding that the section is only 9 
pages long, and about 4 of those are half-pages.  Thus it is obvious I am not 
intending to copy the entire book and thus bilk Prentice-Hall out of sales.

Only thing is, I need to get in touch with Prentice-Hall, the publishers, to 
put my case to them.

Anyone know the name of the person I should get in touch with?
