About the best use I can think of for a PC/XT :-)

If you can find an MRV11-D (to put MXV11-B ROMs into) or an MVX11-B, that
would be the best option (and the only ones DEC supported).  However, it
should be possible to put the code from MXV11-B ROMs into several 24-pin
2Kx8 EPROMs (2716 or equivalent), and put the EPROMs into a BDV11.
 However, you'd want to modify the BDV11 for 22-bit operation (that's ECO
005).

Because old hard drives take a lot of current.  The PSU and wiring loom
won't take a full backplane and two hard drives.

I did one of mine a different way.  I have a BA11-N with the backplane
modified to be 22-bit.  In it is an RQDX2 (or an RQDX3, depending on what's
been shuffled around this month), with a 50-way ribbon cable going to a DEC
box (used to be a TKZ50) which has a PSU, a hard drive, and an RX50.  In
the box is also a small PCB I made to do the job of the distribution board
found in a BA123.  Also in the BA11-N backplane is a modified BDV11, with a
pair of 28-pin EPROM sockets which normally hold microPDP-11/23 boot ROMs.
