Hum.

I expect my message directly to you will bounce then, as I'm using 
Linode as well.

I'm purposely sending this message to you so that it will (hopefully) 
bounce.  That way I can open a support case with Linode, as a customer, 
and *hopefully* get them to change their policy.  ;-)

Let's see what sort of cages I can rattle.

Note:  I do not fault you for your black list.  We are each free to run 
our server(s) the way that we want to.
