My real goal is to update NeXTSTEP, but failing that updating Rhapsody and getting it booting on something modern is OK too.

Wow! Thanks. This is stuff I've not thought of in eons. I use to play 
around with early Darwin releases on my Power Mac I had at the time.

I use to have a website dedicated to things I figured out. I even helped

the author of the Mac Perl book, Chris Nandor, get his Darwin box ( 
which didn't have GUI at the time ), on the internet.
