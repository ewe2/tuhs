Mid 60's. Fixed-head disks replaced them - same basic concept, same amount of
bits, less physical volume. Those lasted until the late 70's - early PDP-11
Unixes have drivers for the RF11 and RS0x fixed-head disks.

The 'fire-hose' drum on the GE 645 Multics was the last one I've heard
of. Amusing story about it here:

Although reading it, it may not have been (physically) a drum.
