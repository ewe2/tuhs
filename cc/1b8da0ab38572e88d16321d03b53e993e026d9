I was under the mistaken impression that recordings of the talks would =

Ah, that=E2=80=99s the final version of what we got a preview of?

Right, that makes sense. I would like to see the =E2=80=9Ccolour=E2=80=9D =
which goes with the slides, i.e. all that isn=E2=80=99t written down..

FreeBSD Journal. There's a number of small technical errors in the talk =
owing to two factors: (1) I couldn't see my speaker notes during the =
talk so I think I misspoke or neglected to include a clarifying sentence =
or two that I'd planned and (2) I found more original material that =
helped to clarify timelines (eg: PWB 1.0 was distributed outside of bell =
labs: it was V6 + the "50 changes" based, but still retained features =
like the V6 TTY driver. This was in 1978, about a year before V7 was =
released. PWB 2.0 was fully V7 based and included updates to the tools =
PWB added, exact details TBD). I did talk a little about the ambiguity =
between UNIX/TS and PWB/UNIX 3.0 in the talk, but the details of that =
need to be ironed out a bit. I hope to go through more original sources =
to figure all that out as different people remember things slightly =
differently, and sometimes contemporary documentation or scholarly =
papers contradicts the remembrance so I need to sort that out better, as =

That is wonderful! I have been desperately trying to find the Unix tapes =
which made it to the University of Milan =E2=80=9CCybernetics=E2=80=9D =
department back in the 70s but have failed miserably. Most of the people =
who were there at the time are sadly no longer with us and my dad =
can=E2=80=99t remember who had them. All that I have left is the =
photocopied Unix manual with the cover printed by the department in =
Italian, an nth copy Lions and then other bits and pieces. All the rest =
is gone forever (or, more likely, in some Italian state warehouse since =
the bureaucracy necessary to throw anything away, or donate it, was so =
daunting it was just stuck somewhere). Unfortunately there were three =
physical moves of the department so chances are the cellars were cleaned =
out by workers.

Thank you again for the talk!
