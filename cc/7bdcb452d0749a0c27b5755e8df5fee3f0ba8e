The paper I am thinking of (gee, I wish I could remember any other details 
about it...) was *very* detailed and specific, and was hardware-specific 
to either the PDP-11 or VAX.  It would not at all be applicable to Linux 
or any kind of modern OS.

I am wondering if it is something in the Leffler et al book, I'll have to 
go back and review that.  I'll have to find my copy of it first...
