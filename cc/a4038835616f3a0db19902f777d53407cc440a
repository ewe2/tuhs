My memory is very very very fuzzy on this.  I seem to recall that microcode
state was pushed onto a stack in certain cases, and that it was possible to
fix some problems there for certain weird cases relating to memory management.
That's all that I remember about it as that's not the part of things that I
was working on, just heard grumbles from other folks about it.
