First, edit post.tm and change the PO font to CW.  Then

	refer post.tm | pic | troff -ms | ps2pdf - post.pdf

I sent Warren (off list) a copy that I dorked with a bit, using groff and
the original V7 ms macros to produce a farily authentic looking Bell Labs

deal with putting things into the archive when he gets back.

Thanks,

Arnold
