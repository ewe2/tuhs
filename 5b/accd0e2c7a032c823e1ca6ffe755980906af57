Subject: [TUHS] Installing and Using Research Unix Version 7 in SimH
 PDP-11/45 Emulator
Message-ID: <5665F4FA.5060709@gmail.com>

All,

In the same vein as my prior note, I have made a note available on the 
process of getting up and running on Unix Seventh Edition in a SimH 
PDP-11 environment. The text is located at:

http://decuser.blogspot.com/2015/12/installing-and-using-research-unix.html

I welcome comments, suggestions, and even criticisms.

While I have learned a lot since my last blog entry (many thanks to 
Hellwig Geisse, Nelson Beebe, Noel Chiappa, Clement Cole and several 
others), I am still learning about these environments. I originally 
invested time in getting v7 running so that I could more easily work 
with v6, after having gone there, I believe that it was time very well 
spent. I know a lot more about special devices, tape formats, and so on 
than I did before as a result of taking the fork in the road.

Thanks for everyone's help.

Oh, and by the way, there appears to be quite a bit of active interest 
in this topic - the blog post has been viewed several thousand times 
since I posted it, two weeks ago.

Kind regards,

Will
