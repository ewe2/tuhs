Quote from the site: "This site contains a copy of the Version 7 Unix
sources, upgraded to conform with modern C conventions."

There's also V6on286, see:
ftp://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixArchive/Other/V6on286/. Refer to the previous
"v6on286" posts this month.

Subject: [TUHS] V7 on i386?

Hello,
I was looking through mailing list archives for any attempts of porting
UNIX V7 to i386. I saw a discussion of it at
http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2002-January/000071.html where
Some
brave soul tries to port V6 to i386; Does anyone know whether or not
anything came out of it?
cheers,
Masoud
PS: needless to say, I've recently joined this mailing list.
