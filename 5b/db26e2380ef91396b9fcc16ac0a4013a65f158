Yes, that's it!  Except it was SPL 0; not that it made any difference, but 
it was just as devastating in user mode.

Damn; I'm still trying to visualise how it works...  It took me ages, the 
first time I saw it; I *think* it propagates the MOV throughout memory, 
leaving a trail of SPLs behind it?

Not a problem in user mode?

But you'd need kernel mode for that; this is a DoS attack (one of the 
first?) launched by a user.

It was two words: "YOU XXXX!" (an indelicate term for a part of the female 
anatomy) followed by the phone being slammed down...

Interesting.  I knew the HALT switch didn't halt the box right away; bus 
transfers still completed so we were taught to W/PROT the RK-05s *after* 
hitting HALT, but I didn't know it worked in combination.
