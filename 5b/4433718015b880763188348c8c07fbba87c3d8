No, not Lions. The author is listed on the first page as one T. R.  
Bashkow.

yup. This would be an early pdp11 UNIX from the period before the  
rewrite in C.

It appears to be a listing of an assembly language version of an  
early UNIX kernel for the pdp11 in the pages labelled E*-*; the pages  
F*-* are a commentary; G*-* is a glossary of terms used; H*-*  
contains a description of each function in the kernel with complete  
details of each function.

It's (Bell Labs flavor) pdp11 assembly language.
