Yeah, SunOS 4.1.4 had some MP work done to it.  Pretty sure I posted
about it here and dragged Greg Limes into it.  He was involved in that
work.  I think it sort of worked up to 4 CPUs but as with all early
kernel threading stuff it worked better when it was a 4 cpus of 
userland work, less so when it was 4 cpus of I/O.
