Subject: [TUHS] SIMH compilation problems
Message-ID: <000001c371a1$3a742770$03fea8c0@maciek>

I was having some problems compiling SIMH on FreeBSD. The reason is, all
the sources have stray MS-DOS carriage returns (^M), while UNIX only
uses line-feeds (^J). This causes GCC to misread some of the code. I
suggest you convert the sources to UNIX text format.

Once I correct all that, the code compiles fine for me.

BTW, why is networking not supported on FreeBSD? Does the pcap driver
not work?
