From what I've heard, "Technical arrogance" and "Cutler" in the same
paragraph is redundant. :-)

I work with a bunch of former Microsofties, most of whom were in the
Windows kernel group. None of them have nice things to say about him. They
acknowledged that Gates could be an insensitive jerk, but at least there
was a method behind his madness (he'd be trying to get the the bottom of
something he wanted to understand and he wanted to be sure other people
understood it too, for example). Cutler on the other hand was just cruel.
One guy said his mother was visiting and was standing in the lobby of a
Microsoft building while Cutler berated someone for some minor fault. "She
learned new words and phrases she hadn't known could exist."

Ironically, despite being totally unwilling to move to Boston in 2000, I
find myself in exile here in the outer provinces of Massachusetts now. It's
kind of amazing to see how many survivors of the minicomputer heydays seem
to be waiting for DEC, Data General, etc, to rise from the ashes and take
over the datacenter again. "Lisp Machines will rise again!"
