I was about 10 at the time, I hope you will excuse me for not recalling =
this detail. I just recall the way that he used my =E2=80=9Carrows in =
the street=E2=80=9D to explain how printf() walked through the argument =
list carrying an arrow on its shoulder, then did what it had to do until =
it got to the end of the street. As you can probably imagine it is still =
how I visualise the workings of printf() to this day. Note that this was =
pure K&R, pre-ANSI C varargs.
