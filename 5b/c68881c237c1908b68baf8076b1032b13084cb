And the other issue was besides not enough buffering DZ11s and the TU58 assumes  software (^S/^Q) for the flow control (DH11s with the DM11 option has hardware (RTS/CTS) to control the I/O rate.  So this of course made 8bit data diificult too. And as Paul points out, with HW flow the priority could have been lower. But the HW folks assumed a so called 3 wire interface because they thought they were saving money.  

A few years later when people tried to put high speed modems like the Trailblazers on them, let’s say the Unix folks quickly abandoned any hope.   Ken O’Humundro at Able Computer has quite a business in his ‘DHDM’ board that was cheaper than the DZ, more ports, full DMA and of course full hardware flow control.  

Btw it was not just DEC.  The original hw version of Masscomp MC500 had the same issue in cpu board brcause Jeff Mitchell (who had been one the 11/34 designer) did not know any better. I fixed the MPU board when it was relaided out and our first 8 port serial controller had rewritten microcode from the original OEM to allow trailblazers to work right (fortunately then HW was there on the serial board but it was just being ignored in the original firmware).

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.
