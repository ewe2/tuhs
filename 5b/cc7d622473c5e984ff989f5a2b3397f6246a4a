Right.

There used to be a host called "TYCHO" (nickname "NSA") at host
zero on imp fifty-seven. (26.0.0.57) (information taken from the old
NIC (Network Information Center for Internet) host tables)

Now there is a machine called "DOCKMASTER" on that same imp port
(TYCHO was an old PDP-11 running version 6 unix (which rumors had
flown for quite some time that someone actually proved was secure)).

Here is what the NIC has to say about DOCKMASTER:

	The National Computer Security Center (DOCKMASTER)=20
	   820 Elkridge Landing Road
	   Room A1127, Building FANX-II
	   Linthicum, MD 21090
=09
=09
	   NetAddress: 26.0.0.57
	   Nicknames: NCSC-MULTICS
=09
	   Host Administrator and Liaison:
	      Aliff, Stephen W.  (SWA1)  Aliff.DODCSC@MIT-MULTICS
	      (301) 850-5888

Multics, if I remember correctly, was just given some level of
certification by the government that it was secure. Interesting, no?

Unfortunately, I'm not nearly as much of a Packrat as some might like
to think so I don't have a Maryland phone book (I do have my silly
putty though), so I can't tell you where this exchange is located
(nor where Terry's work number is located). However, looking up
Linthicum MD (I was born and raised just north of DC) shows that
it's just north of BWI (airport). There is a NASA center right near
there and next to that is an un-marked (of course) NSA center.

All of this points that imp 57 is still NSA's imp.

NIC has this to say about host 1 on imp 57:

	National Security Agency (COINS-GATEWAY)=20
	   COINS Network Control Center
	   Fort George G. Meade, MD 20755
=09
=09
	   NetAddress: 26.1.0.57
	   Nicknames: COINS
=09
	   Host Administrator and Liaison:
	      Smith, Ronald L.  (RLS6)  COINS@USC-ISI
	      (301) 688-6375

The NIC generally likes to give a machine the name "-GATEWAY" when
that machine is a gateway into another part of the internet. (the
machine type of COINS is a Plurbus, which is a multiprocessor
gateway machine manufactured by BBN (the folks who do the ARPANET
and MILNET hardware).=20

In any case, it seems that Mr Ridder is un-(or mis-?)informed.=20

Side note: at the last (Portland) USENIX, I happened across a
gentlemen (very cleancut) whose badge listed him as working for the
"Department of Defense, Fort Meade Maryland". I said "Oh, you're one
of those NSA guys!" To which he replied "How did you know?!"...
"Everyone else in DOD says /which/ part of DOD they work for..."

ps. In case anyone is wondering and before you go giving my name to
people that I don't want to talk to (like the Kind Folks at the NSA
(but I'm sure they've heard of me or will before I finish up with my
current round of paperwork with the DOE/OPM/FBI)), I obtained all of
this information through public channels.

Subject: Your posting


	Mr. Andrew Scott Beals

	I am writing to inform you of at least two facts:

	The computer named "wiretap" belongs to my children,
	age 9, age 7, age 2. Jennifer, the 7 year old, named
	the computer. Sarah, the 9 year old, named the other
	computer "bilbo".=20

	Bilbo and wiretap are both private machines. The are
	owned by my family and I. They are in no way shape or
	form associated with the NSA.=20

	Concerning your posting, I am concerned that you have
	no regard for the safety of federal employees. Your
	posting is marked for distribution "net", if you would
	look at the two previous posting they are marked for
	distribution 'usa'. Therefore, you probably have just
	told most of the world the location of what you believe
	to be an NSA facility. This probably has made the location
	a target for any of a number of terrorist groups. What if
	you are wrong? You have place in danger the lifes of=20
	innocent people. Just because you may think you know something
	does not mean that you tell most of the world.=20

	I would hope that in the future that you would take the
	time to think about all the ramifications before making
	a posting, similiar in nature to the one in question.

	I would hope that you will send out a cancel message on=20
	your posting, before it gets to far.

	I sincerely hope that you restrict your speculations about
	my family's association with any federal agency. I hope
	also that you are mature enough to post an apology for
	inferring that my computers were associated with the NSA.

	I do not want to think of what the implications are from
	that speculation on your part. You may have damaged my
	family's reputation and my own reputation.=20

	Please be a little more responsible in the future.
	Engage brain before fingers.

Ridders machines are NOT on the arpanet. They have uucp links to
Uof Maryland. Ridder himself has an account on mimsy.umd.edu.

Ridders two machines were named by his children. ONe had
just finished reading teh Hobbit (hence bilbo, despite the
2 other known bilbos [not to be confused with certain dildos being =
discussed])
and the other had finished some spy book, hence wiretap.

He is quite pompous and seems to think the world revolves around
him. We asked him to rename "bilbo" to not conflict. He replied that
the other machines should change because he had already named his
machine.

By the way, we're talking about toys here (maybe somthing as expensive
as an IBM-PC) not the "real" machines you might be led to believe.

He is best ignored.
