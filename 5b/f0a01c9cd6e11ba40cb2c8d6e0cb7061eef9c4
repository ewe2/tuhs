Is the DWB 3.4 stuff available anywhere? IIRC, DWB 3.3 was released
under the CPL, but 3.4 seems to be orphaned/lost.

Actually the core engine (though not the actual GUI app) seems to be
in the CPL release of DWB at http://www2.research.att.com/sw/download/

The manual for Picasso in the docs/ folder seems to make reference to
the Open Look version, but all I can find in terms of source code is
the batch/CLI version.
