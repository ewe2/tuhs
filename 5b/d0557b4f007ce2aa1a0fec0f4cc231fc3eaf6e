There was an early version of MkLinux for PCs but I'm not sure if
there was ever a complete distribution.

QNX manages to do realtime fairly decently while still being
Unix-like, although it's certainly not a conventional Unix. With a
multi-server OS with a properly designed microkernel, it is possible
for realtime threads to more or less ignore the fact that they're
running on a Unix-like OS (provided that they can access some kind of
IPC API that closely matches that of the kernel) since all the OS
services other than the microkernel are running beside them at
non-realtime priorities, and not underneath them as in a conventional
OS. It's kind of doing the same thing as running a Unix kernel as a
process under a realtime kernel, but the Unix environment is
implemented by servers and libraries instead of a monolithic kernel.
