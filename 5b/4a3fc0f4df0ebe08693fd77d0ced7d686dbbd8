I understand that Linux can still be called a new kid on the block, but it
is actually not "a new platform" anymore.  It has been deployed (along with
FreeBSD) in large corporations for around 20 years now.  It really
became the Standard OS from embedded world to supercomputers.

Personally I do not find this to be a bad thing, because with OS
standardization comes uniformity, and I would rather have one true
Unix standard than hundreds of incompatible ones.

I believe that the future of proprietary UNIX is doomed and the only
remaining choices for server operating systems will be Linux and Windows in
the near future.  If you think about it, the future is already here...
