And you've got to watch out for these ones, which have been around
since 1973:

#define EPERM           1               /* Operation not permitted */
#define ENOENT          2               /* No such file or directory */
#define ESRCH           3               /* No such process */
#define EINTR           4               /* Interrupted system call */

So that that extent, there is real UNIX code in Linux 8-)
