Subject: [TUHS] 32I status as of 17 Nov 2003
Message-ID: <200311171640.hAHGeOwB024089@wwws.monmouth.com>

1. Converted unpublished locore to AT&T syntax.  Work still underway on
   new locore.S file.

2. Will use coff executable format. May comply with Sys V ABI.  The
   latter is TBD.

3. Gcc is tool chain unless someone wants to take on 32V compiler.  May
   take advantage of inline and asm in machine dependent files.

   I wouldn't recommend using the 32V compiler, mainly because there
   are so many syntax changes, as well as newer compiler technology,
   missing from it as to make it a very challenging project.

4. Gcc cross compile to be used for building.  I'll make this available
   later next month, after I shake out the bugs.

5. May go to Bitkeeper for source control. More to follow.

6. License for all new files to be the "revised BSD license."  This is
   compatible with the Caldera license, an "original BSD license" with
   the advertising clause specific to Caldera.  I want to keep it open
   source, and this is the best compromise I see for project license.

7. May change spln() to more understandable nomenclature, e.g., spl4()
   becomes spltty(), similar to BSD practice.

8. 32I is the interim name.  I would have preferred Unix version 7, but
   can't for obvious trademark reasons.

   Project name still up for grabs.  I was thinking of UNX, named after
   the old DEC name for the facility I work in.  Sort of a tribute to
   days gone by, as is porting 32V.  Probably get into trouble for that
   one as well.
