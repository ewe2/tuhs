Yes, we had ASR 37s, used one myself.  Not only did the do upper and lower
case, but they also did Greek and math characters, had bracket building
characters, and so on.  Biggest problem was line noise since these were
mostly on dial-up.  One could be having a nice day and all of a sudden a
burst of line noise would trigger a shift-out and everything would be
gibberish.
