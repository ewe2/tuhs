That one was a C implementation under GCOS.  There
was another 9-bit one for the PDP-10 (not using Unix).
There was a 4x9 bit version of Unix for the Univac 1100
series, which ran Unix as a guest system over the
native EXEC OS.

The most exotic version was the BBN C-machine, which
had 20-bit words, 10-bit bytes.
