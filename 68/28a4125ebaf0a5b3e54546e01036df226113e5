It's important to know the difference between a font and a typeface.   =20
A typeface isn't protectable.  That's the representation of the actual=20
letters on the printed page (or screen in our case).     George was free=20
to scan the output of the phototypesetter.

The font is the process to make these (in modern days small programs=20
that generate the letters).  This is what can be protected by copyright.

The name can be protected by trademark as well.    HELVETICA is a=20
trademark (now) of Mergenthaler Linotype.    Arial is a similar typeface=20
but that name is owned by Monotype.

Straying a little from the topic, a real Linotype machine is a joy to=20
behold.   They have one at the Baltimore Museum of Science and Industry=20
that they still fire up weekly.   What it does is integrate a keyboard=20
with the actual fonts (molds for molten lead) and casts a line of type=20
(hence the name) at a time.   After it does so, the molds go back into=20
sorted hoppers for further use.

To answer the other question about George Toth at JHU.   He was our=20
documetnation guy and went off to work for Airinc or something.  I've=20
not heard from him in a long time.    We continued to use his verset and=20
a versatec for a while with straight troff.   I also hacked it to draw=20
on the framebuffers in BRL's graphics labs.    Later more fonts became=20
available from the Berkeley vcat/vtroff.   Ditroff allowed direct=20
selection of mutliple fonts as opposed to having to hack on the=20
"railmag" file (remember that guys?).

Standard troff voodoo, just put a power of two backslashes in front of=20
it until it works and if you still have problems add a \c.
