One reason you don=E2=80=99t get more of (b) at USENIX these days is =
that the value to writer is basically nil.

Compare writing a USENIX conference paper with crafting a decent blog =
post: the latter gets immediate distribution, a flurry of comments and =
feedback from peers, and can often kick off new software projects, =
define new industry-wide nomenclature, to say nothing of the career =
benefits of building your professional =E2=80=9Cbrand=E2=80=9D.  All the =
things a paper *used* to do, when people attended conferences and read =
papers as a means of information exchange. =20

The pre-publication peer review process, and the annual (or longer) =
cadence means it=E2=80=99s just not the right venue for a fast-moving =
field, for the majority of topics.  Sometimes, it makes sense to turn a =
successful blog post into a paper, to get some formal recognition, or to =
explore an idea more rigorously, but most of the time, things have moved =
on by then, and for an industrial worker (vs. academic), there=E2=80=99s =
very little incentive: you=E2=80=99re much better off getting another =
high-profile blog post than working through and writing up a paper.

It=E2=80=99d be great to see USENIX rejoin this conversation as an =
essential forum, but it=E2=80=99s hard to see how: disintermediation has =
done its thing.
