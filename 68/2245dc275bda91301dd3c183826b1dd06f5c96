As the last week had a discussion on this list about various VMS+Unix =
projects from that era, maybe it is a good time to ask the below =
question again:

For a while I have been searching for a 1982 tech report from CSRG:

"TR/4 (Proposals for the Enhancement of Unix on the Vax)"

This report later evolved into TR/5, the 4.2BSD manual, but I=E2=80=99m =
specifically looking for TR/4.

The only reference that I have for TR/4 is contained in a 1982 =
discussion about VMS vs. Unix:

https://tech-insider.org/vms/research/1982/0111.html (seek for message =
5854 from Bill Mitchell).

Clutching at straws here, but maybe a copy survived in a box with =
VMS+Unix materials.

Wbr,

Paul
