Thanks for that info on the PDP-10 MMU!

What I meant to say was that the high-low scheme has an echo in how the KL-11 was *used* (not how it *worked*). A standard binary (0407 magic) effectively has two segments in PDP11 Unix: a contiguous low segment (for text, data and bss) and a contiguous high segment (for the stack).
