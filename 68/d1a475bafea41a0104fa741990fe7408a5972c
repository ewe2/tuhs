When Sam Leffler added ufs2 support to FreeBSD's dump/restore
programs, he eliminated support for reading very old dump files.
Supposedly, these were only 4.3BSD based dump files, but it appears
that some newer versions of dump still use this older format.
NetBSD's hasn't been updated to support ufs2, afaik, and even if it
has, the support for the old formats hasn't been removed.

FreeBSD's restore, like all the other restores, does have support for
different endians.  If you have a 4.x old older FreeBSD restore
binary, then you should still be able to read these files.

Just for future reference.  There was talk about extracting restore at
the tip of RELENG_4 and making it a port for dealing with really old
restore files, but nothing ever came of that talk.

Glad to see you were able to deal none the less.  This issue seems to
come up every few months.  Unfortunately, re-merging the old format
support back into restore appears to be kinda hard (where hard here
means that the old code won't work due to structural changes, although
one could imagine making it work w/o too much hassle).
