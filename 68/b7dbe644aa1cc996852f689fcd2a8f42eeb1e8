Ah, right. I opened the mouse because one of the encoders didn't seem to be=
 working (it worked fine again this morning, who knows...) and discovered t=
hat there was something duct taped inside the plastic shell:

Peeling back the tape, I saw what I first took to be chunks of flattened be=
er cans:

A closer look showed that they were the wrappers which cover the corks of w=
ine bottles. Up into the 1980s, these were made out of lead, and by flatten=
ing five of them, a previous owner of the mouse was able to add quite a bit=
 of extra weight to it:
