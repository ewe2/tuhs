I thought there was a filesystem in Ninth Edition called
'/tbl' wherein various system related items could be read.
I have never seen it in operation but I'm sure I saw it
in the kernel code; it seemed to fulfill all the functions
of the non-process related information that Linux dumps
into /proc.

Am I perhaps mistaken about this?
