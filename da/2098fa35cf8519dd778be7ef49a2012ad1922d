  There are these:

http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp11/EK-PC300-V1-001_pro300tecV1.pdf
http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp11/EK-PC300-V2-001_pro300tecV2.pdf

and if they're like the spiral-bound book I had back in 1991, they should
do the trick.

  I wonder if I still have that manual somewhere...the Pro that went
with it is long-gone...
