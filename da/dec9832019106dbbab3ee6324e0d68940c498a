Classically, files don't get de-allocated (their blocks re-added to the =
filesystem free list) until the last open reference to their inode is removed, =
even if the file name is removed from all directories.

This behavior is commonly used for temporary files: open(2) with O_CREAT and =
unlink(2), and file disappears when the file descriptor is finally closed or =
the process exits without explicitly closing the descriptor (the kernel will =
close all descriptors associated with an exiting process).

Where process accounting is concerned, the kernel itself holds the inode =
reference until it is explictly told to turn off process accounting. See =
acct(2).
