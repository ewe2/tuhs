So me, being an uber-geek, tried it on a few boxen again...

On the Mac:

    ozzie:~ dave$ make love
    make: *** No rule to make target `love'.  Stop.

Boring...

On FreeBSD:

    aneurin% make love
    Not war.

Thank you for keeping the faith!

And on my tame penguin:

    dave at debbie:~$ make love
    -bash: make: command not found

Sigh...
