$ echo $NNTPSERVER

I think you have to register and authenticate when you connect.

I use tin now. Used to use nn in nn-6.4 days. Also used
thunderbird in between. May have used every other reader at
various times.

Back in 1989 timeframe I used to get a pretty complete feed
via uucp and maintain locally with cnews. Recently I tried
using "fetchnews" recently for that purpose (for the groups I
want) since eternal-september is a bit slow but something went
wrong.
