I was interested to find out more about this: I looked in Hafner, "Where
Wizards Stay Up Late" (the popular, but well-researched, book on the ARPANET)
but couldn't find 'Lawrence Berkeley' or 'LBL' in the index (although it did
have Lawrence Livermore); there were a couple of 'Californa, University of (at
Berkeley' listings, but none covered this. In Abbate, "Inventing the Internet"
(the first half of which covers the ARPANET), nothing under any of 'Lawrence
Berkeley', 'LBL', 'Berkeley' or 'California'.

In Norberg/O'Neill, "Transforming Computer Technology" (the standard ARPA
history, which has extensive coverage of the ARPANET project), there was one
entry for 'Californa, University (Berkeley)', which might be about the work
you refer to:

  "IPTO issued a contract for a 'network' project at the Berkeley campus of
  the University of California ... because of the presence at Berkeley of
  specialists in programming languages and heuristic programming".

But there's nothing about what was produced. Is there anything you can point
me at that provides more detail? Thanks!
