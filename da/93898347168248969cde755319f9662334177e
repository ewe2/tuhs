There is a pile of "revision #.# intentionally removed" in there. See
http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2006/09/14/netbsd_future.html?page=2

Deadly quote "and nobody cares about that early code history any more
--so this is all water under the bridge."

They are available in a manilla folder through a coughing man in a

dspinellis's truly awesome unix-history-repo.
