Now here:

  https://gunkies.org/wiki/PDP-11_C_stack_operation

along with simple examples of args and auto variables, which are both
referenced via the FP.

Not necessary to do anything with R5 (you can leave it blank); the only things
a PDP-11 C routine needs are:

- a good stack
- the arguments, and return point, on the top of the stack

csv will set up the frame pointer, making no assumptions about the old
contents of R5 - see the source:

  http://ana-3.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/tech/unix/lib/csv.s

although it does save the old R5 contents, and restore them on exit.
