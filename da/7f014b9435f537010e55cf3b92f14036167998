Algol 68, like Algol 60 and Pascal, used := (pronounced "becomes") for
assignment, and the Algol 68 assignment operators were spelled :+=,
:-=, etc. (pronounced "plus and becomes", "minus and becomes", etc.)
Pre-increment operators were already known in Lisp 1.5 long before;
they are now spelled incf and decf in Common Lisp.
