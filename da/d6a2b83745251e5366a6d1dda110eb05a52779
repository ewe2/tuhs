Good morning all, currently trying to sort out one matter that still bewild=
ers me with this documentation I'm working on scanning.

So I've got two copies of the "Release 5.0" User's Manual and one copy of t=
he "System V" User's Manual.  I haven't identified the exact differences, l=
ots of pages...but they certainly are not identical, there are at least a f=
ew commands in one and not the other.

Given this, and past discussion, it's obvious Release 5.0 is the internal U=
NIX version that became System V, but what I'm curious about is if it was e=
ver released publicly as "Release 5.0" before being branded as System V or =
if the name was System V from the moment the first commercial license was i=
ssued.

The reason I wonder this is some inconsistencies in the documentation I see=
 out there.  So both of my Release 5.0 User's Manuals have the Bell logo on=
 the front and no mention of the court order to cease using it.  Likewise, =
all but one of the System V related documents I received recently contain a=
 Bell logo on the cover next to Western Electric save for the Opeartor's Gu=
ide which curiously doesn't exhibit the front page divestiture message that=
 other documents missing the Bell logo include.  Furthermore, the actual co=
ver sheet says "Operator's Guide UNIX System Release 5.0" so technically no=
t System V. In fact, only the User's Manual, Administrator's Manual, Error =
Message Manual, Transition Aids, and Release Description specifically say S=
ystem V, all the rest don't have a version listed but some list Release 5.0=
 on their title page.

Furthering that discrepancy is this which I just purchased: https://www.eba=
y.com/itm/314135813726?_trkparms=3Damclksrc%3DITM%26aid%3D111001%26algo%3DR=

26pmt%3D0%26noa%3D1%26pg%3D2380057&_trksid=3Dp2380057.c100675.m4236&_trkpar=

0adef7482b3fffe1682|iid%3A1

Link lives as of this sending, but contains a closed auction for an Error M=
essage Manual from the "Release 5.0" documentation line but no Bell logo.  =
Until the Operator's Guide and this auction link, I haven't seen any "Relea=
se 5.0" branded stuff without a Bell logo, and before I bought the System V=
 gold set, I hadn't seen System V branded stuff *with* the Bell logo.

This shatters an assumption that I had made that at the same time the docum=
entation branding shifted to System V was the same time the removal of the =
Bell logo happened, given that divestiture was what allowed them to aggress=
ively market System V, but now this presents four distinct sets of System V=
 gold documentation:

Release 5.0 w/ Bell logo
Release 5.0 w/o Bell logo
System V w/ Bell logo
System V w/o Bell logo

I'm curious if anyone would happen to know what the significance here is.  =
The covers are all printed, I can't see any indication that a bunch of 5.0 =
manuals were retroactively painted over nor that any System V manuals got s=
tamped with a Bell post-production.  What this means is "Release 5.0" docum=
entation was being shipped post-divestiture and "System V" was being shippe=
d pre-divestiture.  If Release 5.0 was publicly sold as System V, then what=
 explains the post-divestiture 5.0 manuals floating around in the wild, and=
 vice versa, if USG couldn't effectively market and support UNIX until the =
divestiture, how is it so many "Release 5.0" documents are floating around =
in well produced commercial-quality binding, both pre and post-divestiture =
by the time the name "System V" would've been king.  Were they still mainta=
ining an internal 5.x branch past System V that warranted its own distinct =
documentation set even into the commercial period?  This period right aroun=
d '82-'83 is incredibly fascinating and I feel very under-documented.
