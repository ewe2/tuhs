It's been a long time but my memory is that PDP-11 instructions were way
cleaner than any other system I've seen.  My TA for my PDP-11 assembly
class could read octal like it was C, I was never that good.  He told
me it was actually pretty easy once you memorized the instruction set,
which he claimed was not hard because it was so uniform.  I never learned
it well enough to know, just did a handful of programs in assembler,
but his description has stuck with me.  I've had to learn enough SPARC,
MIPS, and (shudder) x86, to do kernel debugging and I've never gotten
the sense that they were are clean as PDP-11 was.
