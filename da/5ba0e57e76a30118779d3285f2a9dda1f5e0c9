Yes, this really is OT ...

This is very true. I discovered this when, at the age of 18, I came to spend
a year studying in Israel. At that point I realized that Americans are
terribly parochial.  ("Whaddaya mean you don't speak English?!?  Whaddaya
mean I can't get a hmaburger here?" etc.)

It's worse than just TV (and movies). It's huge parts of the culture. We
moved to Israel 20 years ago, and on the highways are signs for: Ace
Hardware, Toys 'R' Us, Office Depot, McDonald's ...  UPS and FedEx trucks
are common sights.  As well as the culture, many of the values (that
I personally moved to Israel to get away from) have seeped in as well.
"Cultural Pollution" wouldn't be too strong a term.

I suspect that said programmer didn't even know enough to think about
making it general.

FWIW,
