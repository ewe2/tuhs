Do you want a UUCP (bag) feed again?

I provided UUCP "bag" feed to one of my peers on the first server I ran. 
  I'd be happy to do so again.

  - UUCP "bag" files pushed / pulled via SCP / SFTP.
     - Could probably be done over email too.
  - UUCP over SSH
  - UUCP over TCP port 540)
  - Secure UUCP TCP port 4031)

Obviously:

  - NNTP over TCP port 119
  - Secure NNTP over TCP port 563

I'm also willing to hear about other creative options too.

  - VPN
     - IPSec
     - SSL / TLS
     - WireGuard
     - OpenVPN
