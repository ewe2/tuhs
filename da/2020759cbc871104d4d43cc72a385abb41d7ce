I picked up a book in the early nineties called File Structures or File Systems: I've forgotten which, 
because I didn't read it as much as I had intended. It covered the IBM MVS mainframe dataset file and 
directory structure and the Unix file and directory structure. And yes, I was referring to the MVS dataset, 
as much of it as I can remember from that book. (I sorry I can't recall the exact title: the book is 
somewhere at the bottom of a pile of other books from my last move several years ago.)
