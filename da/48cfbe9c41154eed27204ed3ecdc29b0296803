One thing I've realized as the unit of computing becomes more and more
abundant (one off
HW->mainframes->minis->micros->servers->VMs->containers) the OS
increasingly becomes less visible and other software components become
more important.  It's an implementation detail like a language runtime
and software developers are increasingly ill equipped to work at this
layer.  Public cloud/*aaS is a major blow to interesting general
purpose OS work in commercial computing since businesses increasingly
outsource more and more of their workloads. The embedded (which
includes phones/Fuschia, accelerator firmware/payload, RTOS etc) and
academic (i.e. Cambridge CHERI) world may have to sustain OS research
for the foreseeable future.

There is plenty of systems work going on but it takes place in
different ways, userspace systems are completely viable and do not
require switching to microkernels.  Intel's DPDK/SPDK as one
ecosystem, Kubernetes as another - there is a ton of rich systems work
in this ecosystem with eBPF/XDP etc, and I used to dismiss it but it
is no longer possible to do so rationally.  I would go as far as
saying Kubernetes is _the_ datacenter OS and has subsumed Linux itself
as the primary system abstraction for the next while.. even Microsoft
has a native implementation on Server 2022.  It looks different and
smells different, but being able to program compute/storage/network
fabric with one abstraction is the holy grail of cluster computing and
interestingly it lets you swap the lower layer implementations out
with less risk but also less fanfare.

Kevin
