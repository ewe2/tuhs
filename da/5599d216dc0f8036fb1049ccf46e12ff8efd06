Read the code again, you missed it. :-)
The code first writes one value into memory (R3), then complements R3, 
and for each location checks that the memory is *not* equal to R3, and 
then writes R3 and checks that it now matches. Essentially checking that 
it can be changed into a wanted value in time. And it does it two times. 
First zeroing, and then writing ones, and then back to zeroes again, so 
yes, the memory will be left containing all zeros, except for what 
memory isn't tested.

Indeed.
