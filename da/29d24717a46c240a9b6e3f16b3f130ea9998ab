The "simpler hardware handling" is a big inducement to building
on top of VM. Or at least starting out that way.

Even though AIX/370 was aimed at the educational market, my impression
is that it was still pretty expensive.  When I worked at the Emory U
computing center (mid 80s) I heard about it, but management wasn't
interested in trying to get it for their S/390.

I'm pretty sure I remember hearing at some point, I don't remember when,
that AIX/370 could run either under VM or on bare iron.

Any idea what Linux/370 does?  I think it runs on bare iron.
