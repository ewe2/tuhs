Among the BUGS listed for spell(1) in v7 was "Britsh spelling was
done by an American".

Nevertheless, at least one British expat thanked me for spell -b.
He had been using the original "spell", and ignoring its reports
of British "misspellings". But, he said, long exposure to American
writing had infected his writing. Spell -b was a blessing, for
revealed where his usage wobbled between traditions.
