Presumably, it's not 'y' but has some non-printable characters in it.
You could try "od -c ." to see what the entry actually is, or move
t.tar out of the way and "rm -r" remove the next level up.

If you run "mkdir foo" from the shell, does it work properly?  That will
let you split between the problem being in tar and the problem being in
mkdir.  Adding some printf()s to checkdir() seems a reasonable step.
