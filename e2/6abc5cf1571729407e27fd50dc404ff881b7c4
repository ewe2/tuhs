Try checking to see if there is any disk space left on the root RL device.
It may be full -- these were tiny by today's standards -- disk drives.  10
Mb, if I recall correctly.

The other possibility is that the /tmp directory has the wron permission.
It should be read/write to all (drwxrwxrwx).  If not, try running chmod 0777
/tmp as root, then try compiling again.

You can fix the control E problem by running the command

SET CONSOLE WRU char

... where char is the charcter you wish to use.  (WRU stands for "where are
you" according to the SIMH documentation
http://simh.trailing-edge.com/pdf/simh_doc.pdf).

The biggest PDP-11 had 4 Mb of memory, so you certainly won't be limited
there.  I suspect that if you run nothing else,on the machine you will get
fair perfomance on the emulated PDP-11.  2.11 BSD should run.

As far as your other terminal problems, you probably just need an
appropriate setting for the TERM environment variable to get vi to work.
Usually TERM=vt100 works, but your mileage may vary.

Real men use ed, though!  [?]  I always amaze people by being by being able
to use ed.  Of course, that's because I'm very old -- old enough to have
actually used V6 on a real PDP-11.  I think I'll take a nap now.
