Bell=E2=80=99s Observation on Computer Classes has brought surprises
	- we=E2=80=99ve had some very popular new devices appear at the =
bottom end of the market and sell in the billions.

Even 10yrs ago, I=E2=80=99d not have expected Apple to build their own =
Silicon & certainly not to make a high-performance system based on ARM.

I=E2=80=99d expect more surprises will come, selling in huge numbers.

An obvious application area is Networking + Storage, but many other =
possibilities exist.
$10 interface for SATA drives to Ethernet would solve a lot of SOHO / =
SME storage problems, if only a local backup to the Cloud.

MIT has produced ports of v6 for x86 & RISC-V - used for teaching =
purposes.

	<https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public>
	<https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv>=20

Could a version of v6 or v7 run on a microcontroller? Perhaps.
Not many versions of Linux run so leanly.

If a product based on a microcontroller & v6/v7 became a very popular =
product,=20
Copyright & Ownership might become an issue :(
Even after the =E2=80=9CSCO v IBM=E2=80=9D case someone might see a =
payday.

But why would anyone use "Version Zero" in what turned out to be quite a =
line of OS=E2=80=99s from Dept 1127 / CSRC??

Plan 9 or Inferno - born multi-processor, network aware and embedding =
30+ years experience -=20
would be the obvious platform for a =E2=80=9Cnew small thing=E2=80=9D.

You=E2=80=99ve already covered on-list the Plan 9/ Inferno licensing, =
and there=E2=80=99s no impediment.

While Vintage Cars are fascinating to gawk at and may be rewarding to =
repair & rebuild,
they don=E2=80=99t include modern materials, designs, performance and =
safety.

Fun for a hobby & special event, but not 1st choice for daily use.

I think v6 on different platforms will have a very long life in a few =
areas,
but is not what I=E2=80=99d choose for a commercial product.
