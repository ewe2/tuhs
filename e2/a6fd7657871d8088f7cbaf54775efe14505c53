I did a lot of work with RS232 in the 80's to the point where my friend 
said I had coined a new phrase - basically sounds like 
"Are-Ess-too-turdy-too" said really fast ;) (I'm from NY)

 From serial lines that were slow, going to parallel interfaces for 
printers, parallel SCSI, and a few other parallel interfaces, I thought 
were nice, now we've gone back to SATA, SAS and PCI-E lanes that are 
basically serial interfaces.

I have an RS232 breakout box I use for situations like this. Still 
having to deal with DTE-DCE issues to this day with Cisco, Nortel/Avaya, 
and other network, telecom or even SAN equipment. A recent Dell 
Compellent SC7xxxx I installed came with a USB cable, but it's really a 
USB to RS232 interface built into the controllers. SMH.
