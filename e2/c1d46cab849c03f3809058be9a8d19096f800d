A quick google search reveals:

http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/
and https://www.openbsd.org/papers/magnusson_pcc.pdf
which is a set of slides on the work done.

I've been itching to rewrite PDP-7 Unix in a higher level language.
I've already designed the language and written a compiler for the PDP-7
(see https://github.com/DoctorWkt/h-compiler), but the generated code sucks.
Maybe I should try to retarget PCC, it would be slightly ironic :-)

Cheers, Warren
