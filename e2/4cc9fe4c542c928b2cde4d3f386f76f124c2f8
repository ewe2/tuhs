Tricky. The 8266 is rather odd in that it inverts one of the inputs
and I know of no direct replacement. I'll check if I have a spare  
M7260 card.

As for replacing chips, particularly on old cards. The only safe way  
is to:-

1)	with a fine pair of cutters, cut every leg of the chip and remove  
the body
2)	with needle nose pliers, grab each leg in turn, heat on the other  
side
	with a soldering iron and pull out the leg (use a light force and  
make sure
	the solder is molten on the top side, particularly if it has a track)
3)	with a solder sucker (or desoldering station), remove the solder  
from the holes

If the chip was toasted, then this track probably took all the  
current. You can
either glue it down and bridge the break with solder, or cut the track  
where it's
good, scrape off the PCB lacquer, then carefully solder in some wire.  
If it is
a short run, use some stiff tinned copper, then hot glue in place.

You can disable the serial interface by removing W1 from the control  
logic /
microcode board M7261. It is not possible to disable the LTC, simply  
don't
enable it on the DL11W. I have, in the distant past, modified a M7260  
for
9600 baud RS232, but it involves removing removing several components  
and
modifying the 9602 oscillator timing. Using a DL11 is a better choice.
