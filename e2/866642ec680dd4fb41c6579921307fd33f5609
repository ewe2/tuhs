Subject: [pups] 2.11BSD on non separate I&D systems?
Message-ID: <p05111a03b977bc56fc8c@[192.48.232.56]>

Hi folks,

Forgive me in case this question has been asked before..

Has anyone done anything to try and get 2.11BSD working
on non-separate I&D PDP-11s?

One of the various READMEs I ran across said it might be possible
with some creative memory layouts using overlays.

I briefly searched the PUPS mail archives but turned up
nothing.

Thanks,
