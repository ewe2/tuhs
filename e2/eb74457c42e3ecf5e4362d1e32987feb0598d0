Jon, I think you might be old enough to have run v7, if not, like me, you
have read the Lions book and loved it.  That kernel didn't do much, it was
uniprocessor, block interrupts design, no networking, it was very basic.
Amazingly nice to read, but it didn't do a lot.

Which is part of the reason we liked it.  I loved SunOS 4.x but it was
also a uniprocessor kernel (Greg Limes tried to make it SMP but it was not
a kernel that wanted to be SMP).  I loved it because I could understand
it and it was a bit more complex than v7.

The problem space that kernels address these days include SMP, NUMA,
and all sorts of other stuff.  I'm not sure I could understand the Linux
kernel even if I were in my prime.  It's a harder space, you need to
know a lot more, be skilled at a lot more.

My take is we're old dudes yearning for the days when everything
was simple.  Remember when out of order wasn't a thing?  Yeah, me too,
I gave up on trying to debug kernels when kadb couldn't tell me what I
was looking at.
