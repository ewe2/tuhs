It is amazing how well pipes fit into this model, up to a point.  I once wrote a program
to generate and collate hundreds of thousands of images.  I used the  sed/grep/awk model,
with all the ease of attendant text I/O processing.

I was surprised one day to find it running twice as fast as usual.  They had doubled the number of
CPUs in the machine, and my program Just Worked.  Not bad for an idea that was 35 years old.

Of course, your fleet of processors will require different programming (CSP with go?).  I look forward
to see if your solutions are even remotely as easy and useful as the originals.  

BTW, will those processors basically be 8051s?

We are breaking ground in new ways to use hundreds of processors to solve problems very quickly.  It's a new way of thinking, and it makes your brain hurt.  But is is what the hardware is giving us, and there is at least another order of magnitude ahead before this trend starts running out of steam.
