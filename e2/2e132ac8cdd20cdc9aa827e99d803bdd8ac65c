Thank you for stressing the importance of Solaris as a Unix descendant 
for which source code is available.  It's a pity that we don't have 
public source code for the Solaris versions 2.1 to 10, so there's a 15 
year gap between System V R4 and the first release of Open Solaris.

I don't agree that BSD systems are a clone of Unix.  There are bits in 
them that were written at Bell Labs.  The earliest example I've found up 
to now comes from timezone.c, and was written at least 36 years ago 
(1979-01-10 14:58:45).

Compare the 7th Edition implementation of timezone()

http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V7/usr/src/libc/gen/timezone.c

with lines 110-128 of the current FreeBSD _tztab() implementation.

https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/master/lib/libc/gen/timezone.c

(How did I find it?  For the past six months I've been running git blame 
on various tags of https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo.)

Happy new year everybody!
