I seem to be missing one or two messages per day on this list to
complete the threads.  No big deal, but I'm a perfectionist and it
grates.

The message by Arthur to which Larry was replying had been one of the
missing ones.  I have checked my MTA log and there is no trace of the
Message-ID of Arthur's message.  So it is definitely _not_ the case that
I received it but it went "into the spam bin".

As far as I can tell I'm on the "non-mangled" part of the team.
