Someone who is no longer on this list said to the same topic to
me, in October:

  Wer zu schnell nach Rechts kommt, strukturiert zu wenig ;-)

  Who approaches the right too fast, does not structure enough

More or less.  In the context that i turned to space indentation
when i started using C not C++.

I missed the possibility in screen(1), now in tmux(1) i can use

  bind-key -T prefix       <      set-window-option force-width 80
  bind-key -T prefix       >      set-window-option force-width 0

again.

Whatever you say, i only wanted to add that "Human attention" is
only so far stretchable, and that readers likely cannot grasp line
lengths of that size, especially if densely packed or the
surrounding lines are of significantly different length.  Some
neurologist could surely correct me.
With tab indentation, a function with one level of conditionals
eats up 16 rows, so the more or less ideal line length of 64 (if
i recall correctly Knuth advocated 66) is the result.
