v7 wants two parameters too.  This was probably some attempt at cleanup that
didn't survive.

To fork a hacker nursery rhyme:

System III!  System III!
See how it runs!  See how it runs!
Its longjmp() loses so totally,
It runs all its programs in 'I & D',
It's made by our fav'rite monopoly,
System III!
