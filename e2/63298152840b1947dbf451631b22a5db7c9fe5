Thanks Doug. I'll do a cross-check of both our efforts soon.

1st Ed: http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/1stEdman.html
2nd Ed: http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/research/1972_stuff/unix_2nd_edition_manual.pdf
3rd Ed: http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/research/Dennis_v3/v3man.tar.gz

The 3rd Ed ones are machine-readable roff format, so it would be possible
with some effort to recreate the 2nd Ed roof source using 3e and lots of
elbow grease. James Markevitch is working on an OCR of the 2e manuals, so
when his text version becomes available that would help the work.

Let us know the progress: having a good disassembler would be very useful.
