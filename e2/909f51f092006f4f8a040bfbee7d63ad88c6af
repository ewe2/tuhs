I remember Jan-Simon Pendry telling me in the 1980s, that the NULL 
dereference check was first introduced in SunOS with much pain due to 
the resulting crashes. In BSD Unix, which preceded it, the VAX MMU was 
setup with a page in virtual address 0 that would contain the value 0 at 
that address.  (BSD Unix offered memory protection. I assume it had this 
setup for backward compatibility.)
