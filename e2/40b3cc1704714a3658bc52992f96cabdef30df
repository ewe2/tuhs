This is apparently not the same as Robert Elz's disc [sic] quotas, which
were first released with 4.2BSD.  That was the first version to cash the
cheque supplied by all Research versions until 8th Edition:

Since there were never any such procedures in the line leading to System
V, there was no longer any reason to restrict giving away files.

Quotas aren't very useful any more, what with most systems being either
single-user clients or servers with no need for privilege separation
other than root/non-root.  Unless you are using mandatory access
control, which has never been a standard part of any Unix-like system, I
see no reason to continue to forbid changes of ownership.

Looking at
<http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=1BSD/man6/chownall.6>
suggests that in the base system underlying 1BSD, you were only the
superuser if you had a uid of 0 and a gid of 0.  I suspect this was a
kernel patch.
