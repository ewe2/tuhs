Yes. Did it to a TK50Z & TZ30 many times. Slow, but works ...

What version is your "linux" ? There were problems in earlier version 
(redhat before 7.x ?) exactly with the block command on tapes, and 
that's what bites you :(

Just make sure your tape drive is clean, check if you get any errors 
during writing the tape.

And don't use any scripts, just compile the maketape.c, it worked for me 
many times.
