Dennis,

As you may know, Unitech Software Inc. has been distributing "Unix
Magic" posters at recent Usenix conferences.  The poster shows a
wizard that looks kinda like you mixing various Unix tools together to
make a potion of some sort.  The only thing that isn't obviously some
sort of pun on an aspect of Unix is a canister labeled Oregano in the
foreground of the picture.

Is there some significance behind this, other than the obvious
"oregano" double meaning?  Did you guys really use "oregano" to help
drum up your creativity for the original Unix development?

Just curious.

The significance of its appearance is unknown to me.
Perhaps it is a Berkeley addition?
