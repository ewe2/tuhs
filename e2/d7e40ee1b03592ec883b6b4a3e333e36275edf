The first version of Venix-86 ran on the PC/XT, almost a 5150, in May =
83. It was V7 based. I think it was the first Unix on a PC.

Heinz Lycklama (who did Unix LSX and MX at Bell labs in the 70=E2=80=99s) =
did PC/IX about a year later, based  on Sys III. This was marketed by =
IBM.

Based on the early Xenix porting chart here =
http://seefigure1.com/2014/04/15/xenixtime.html , a PC/XT version of =
Xenix appeared around the same time as PC/IX. However, if the chart is =
correct there may have been Xenix versions for other 8086-based machines =
a year before that. Note that in this chart the =E2=80=9CXenix 2.0=E2=80=9D=
 and =E2=80=9CXenix 3.0=E2=80=9D labels refer to MS internal versions, =
i.e. these numbers are not to be confused with the marketing labels IBM =
PC Xenix 2.0 and 3.0.

These versions are a hole in the TUHS archive (unless they are in the =
confidential archive). It would be wonderful if MS would open up =
pre-1984 Xenix on the occasion of Unix 50th. These builds would well =
illustrate the broad Unix portability, which was unique at the time.
