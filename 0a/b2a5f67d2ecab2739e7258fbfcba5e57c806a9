Are you possibly thinking of an article that appeared in the 1978 Bell System
Technical Journal?

From the bibliography in "The UNIX System":

Bourne, S. R.  1978. "UNIX Time-Sharing System: The UNIX Shell". Bell Sys.
Tech. J. 57(6) 1971-90.

The issues of BSTJ that I have seen could be described as slim books - roughly
A5 paperback, around 200 pages.

This article is supposed to have also appeared in Volume 2 of the UNIX
Programmer's Manual - which would imply that it is the same as "An Introduction
to the UNIX Shell" (which is what my 7th Ed Manual contains).
