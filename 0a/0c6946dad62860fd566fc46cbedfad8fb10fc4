What I find fascinating (and that no-one has mentioned yet) is how anyone
can claim that Unix internals are still trade secret, especially given
this book:

	The Design of the UNIX Operating System,
	Maurice J. Bach.
	Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, USA, 1986.
	ISBN 0-13-201799-7.

There's also these:

	The Magic Garden Explained:
	The Internals of Unix System V Release 4:
	An Open Systems Design,
	Berny Goodheart, James Cox, John R. Mashey.
	Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, USA, 1994.
	ISBN 0-13-098138-9.

	Unix Internals: The New Frontiers,
	Uresh Vahalia.
	Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, USA, 1996.
	ISBN 0-13-101908-2.
	According to Amazon.com, a new edition is scheduled for 2005.

The Bach book, in particular, is a rather large smoking gun that AT&T
didn't care a huge amount about trade secrets.  The book is still in
print (and selling for a whopping $69.97 on Amazon.com!).  It doesn't
contain actual source code, but let's get real here...
