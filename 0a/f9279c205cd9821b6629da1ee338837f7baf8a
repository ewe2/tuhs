All octal from here on.

CDC had several different character sets, most called BCD.  They were
unlike Fieldata, which in fact bore some resemblance to ASCII (letters
starting @ABC.. from 0 (or 40 in ASCII), digits starting at 60, ...)

In 7600 BCD, ABC started at 21 (internal) or 61 (external), and digits
started at 00, though in the external form 0 was out of line at 12.
The 3200 system had different coding again; digits were XS3 starting
at about 53.

As if that wasn't enough, the code table I'm looking at right now
(7600) has something called ASCII SUBSET with (upper case) letters
starting at 41 and digits starting at 20.  No idea why they called it
ASCII.

Isn't it wonderful that we no longer have issues with character
representation?
