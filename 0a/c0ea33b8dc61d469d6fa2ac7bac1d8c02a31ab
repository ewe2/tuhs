"The Programmer's Workbench was started in 1973,[2]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWB/UNIX#cite_note-Mashey-2> by Evan Ivie
and Rudd Canaday to support a computer center for a 1000-employee Bell Labs
division" is what wikipedia says, though that reference is in a acm queue
article by Mashey...

PWB 1.0 was released just after V6 "based on" it.

Yes. PWB had their own collection of add-ons. I believe, but can't find the
reference, that there were frequent imports of Research Unix into PWB as I
saw references to UNIX/TS and CB-UNIX never getting too far away from
Research Unix, so that's kinda speculative...  I imagine that SCCS was a
boon for keeping it all straight, but I've never actually used SCCS.

Several timelines have, without references, Unix/TS or some variant of that
going back to the V4 time frame. It's at best murky. There's some
references in https://wiki.tuhs.org/doku.php?id=misc:snippets:mert1 including
the post by Dan DeJegar which I had trouble parsing the ins and outs of.

Yea, the Columbus crew added a lot to the different versions, and merged
from them, according to the above link and a few other sources.

This jives with other information that says the basis of system V share
memory, semaphores and ipc were derived from CB-Unix...

Yes. There's some confusion as PWB and UNIX/TS become a USG thing that
turns into System III and then the influx of CB-UNIX that's added before
System V. How all that relates to USG, I'm quite unclear on still...

I've seen lots of references to UNIX/TS, but no versions, so this makes
some sense... And it appears they go back further than V6...

Yea, the detailed part of my history ends with the progeny of V7 (and I
only have room for some, I've found maybe 3 dozen different systems that
started out with V7 and then merge in System III or System V code for later
versions or some variation on this theme).
