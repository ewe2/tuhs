	"unknown" or "unused"

	On my virtual 11 I see disklabel report:

8 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize]
  a:    16720        0   2.11BSD     1024  1024         # (Cyl.    0 - 39)
  b:     8360    16720      swap                        # (Cyl.   40 - 59)
  c:   340670        0    unused     1024  1024         # (Cyl.    0 - 814)
  h:   315590    25080   2.11BSD     1024  1024         # (Cyl.   60 - 814)

	Ah, that says something is corrupt somewhere.

	If you look at /usr/include/sys/disklabel.h you'll see the
	table of filesystem types:

static char *fstypenames[] = {
        "unused",
	"swap",
	"Version 6",
	"Version 7",
	"System V",
	"2.11BSD",
	"Eighth Edition",
	"4.2BSD",
	"MSDOS",
	"4.4LFS",
	"unknown",
	"HPFS",
	"ISO9660",
	0
};

	So for 'unknown' to appear there would need to be a 10 in the type
	field instead of a 5 (for "2.11BSD").   'unused' is a 0 obviously.

	Try booting up a standalone disklabel and see what it says without
	a kernel getting involved.

	Steve
