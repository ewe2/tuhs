Warren,

In looking at the Spencer tape, I can see how this might be considered 
the 101 fixes (Wolff's comment that he had only "heard about" the 
changes, might indicate a quantity mismatch). The 52 fixes in 
usr/sys/v6unix/unix_changes represent "the differences between level 6 
unix and bell unix". On top of those changes, there are 31 additional 
fixes called "CORRECTIONS to level 6 code" and a whopping 57 "programs 
written specifically for or heavily modified for, AUSAM" which I suppose 
are what are referred to as "ENHANCEMENTS to level 6 UNIX". The tape 
contains "The Second Australian Sixth Edition" and has #ifdef's to 
determine if the system is an AUSAM system. The 52 v6 fixes are 
straightforward to see because the tape has the original source in one 
directory tree and the changes in another. Whereas the other 
enhancements and fixes are a bit more challenging because they are 
related to AUSAM's mods.

Thanks for the warm welcome, the direction, and for posting my question.

One more question, how did you zero in on 
Applications/Spencer_Tapes/unsw3.tar.gz as containing the fixes, the 
notes in the archive, from Spencer, are pretty bare:

    unsw3.tar is yet another anthology, this one Australian. I can't find a
    README file, but some quick experimental grepping doesn't find any dates
    later than 1977, so this one may be really early.

Regards,

Will
