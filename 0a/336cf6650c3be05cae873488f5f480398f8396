Moo and hunt-the-wumpus got quite a lot of play
both in the lab and at home. Wump was an instant
hit with my son who was 4 or 5 years old at the
time.

Amusingly, I speculated on how to generate degree-3
graphs for wump, but obviously not very deeply. It
was only much later that I realized the graph
always had the same topology--a dodecahedron.
