Could whoever runs this broken mirror please fix the damned mailer so that 
it handles my RFC-compliant banner?  I do not appreciate retries every 
five seconds or so, because Dovecot cannot seem to handle a multi-line 
SMTP banner (a great spam defence); I have since firewalled the IP address 
of 45.79.103.53 out of self-defence.

Thank you.
