Subject: [TUHS] Ninth Edition incomplete?
Message-ID: <530ddda5-58ac-93fd-579e-c697aafd26b9@aueb.gr>

First, many thanks to all people who made it possible to release v8 to 
v10 and especially to Warren for bringing them together.

I went through the files in the Ninth Edition available at 
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Norman_v9/ and I fear 
that the distribution may be incomplete.  The manual pages for most 
sections are missing.  Also, many v8 /usr/src/cmd commands are not 
available in v9 /cmd.  This is the list of the difference between the 
two sets.

Anyone knows what is going on?  Does someone have a more complete 
distribution of the Ninth Edition that Warren can put online?
