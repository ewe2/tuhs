Jon Steinhart:

  One amusing thing that Steve told me which I think I can share is why the
  symmetry of case-esac, if-fi was broken with with do-done; it was because
  the od command existed so do-od wouldn't work!

=====

As I heard the story in the UNIX room decades ago (and at least five
years after the event), Steve tried and tried to convince Ken to
rename od so that he could have the symmetry he wanted.  Ken was
unmoved.
