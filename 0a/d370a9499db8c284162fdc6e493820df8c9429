Lord knows I learned Unix by watching my peers type it...

In the long run that was both good and bad, though, since now all I get to
see people type are shell scripts which range from brilliant to rubbish...
The only way to know where on that spectrum things are is to read a bunch
of them... and to get burned a few times stealing the techniques that are
best described, in hindsight, as "it seemed like a good idea at the time."
