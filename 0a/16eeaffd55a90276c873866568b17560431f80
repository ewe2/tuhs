This bug appears to be the result of taking a shortcut rather
than complexity. I suspect this shortcut was taken consciously,
not realizing it could be misused. And the "Rowhammer" problem
is certainly not due to complexity but (again) playing close to
the edge -- the cell geometry is too small to not fail!

They did try a newer architecture (itanium) but the market
rejected it. The same reason we still continue to use buffer
overflow inducing languages. Inertia & the cost of change.

This was a fascinating read! Thanks for the reference.
