Yes, for political reasons I needed to make the 4.3BSD-Quasijarus compressor a
version of compress, not gzip (can't have any GNU), but I wanted to have the
higher compression ratio of deflation, so I created a new version of compress
that supports deflation in addition to the original LZW algorith.  You can find
the new compress in components/compress.tar either on my FTP site or in Warren's
archive in the 4BSD area.

"4.3BSD-Tahoe Vax distribution" is an oxymoron.  Berkeley released the Tahoe
tape with Tahoe binaries, no VAX binaries.  I was the one who compiled the Tahoe
source for the VAX, and the result was 4.3BSD-Quasijarus0.

OTOH, you may be referring to the fact that the Tahoe distribution in the
archive is broken.  Yes, it is.  Unfortunately there was an unrecoverable tape
read error.

This has come up time and again.  SIMH's emulation of VAX is too poor.  VAX is
not an easy architecture to emulate.
