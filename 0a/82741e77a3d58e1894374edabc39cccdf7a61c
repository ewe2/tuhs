​Indeed.   Kirk ended up getting some sort of legal rights for his version
of it [don't ask me which - trademark/copyright] .

Sadly my wife threw out my Foglio shirt a few years after we were married
(one of our first disagreements on the value of 'old' things - which
continues today - now she stay out the basement where my museum is😎.   In
her defense, it was probably 5-6 years old then, had holes and had not worn
well.   The shirts were very inexpensively made and frankly after 20-30
washings, the red piping on the side had faded and a few more washing the
printing started to fall off.
