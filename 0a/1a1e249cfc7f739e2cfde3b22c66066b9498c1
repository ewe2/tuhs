Subject: [Unix-jun72] warning - removing files
Message-ID: <Pine.BSI.4.64.0805061313120.20114@malasada.lava.net>

I removed some older tools from the svn.  If you're still using them
and want to hold on to them, you might want to back up your copy
before updating, or pull old versions from svn (feel free to send
me questions if you are unsure how).

Assemv7 and assem went away as did dumpaout.py.
