Subject: [TUHS] Short history of 'grep'
Message-ID: <201602012057.u11Kv4ED006736@coolidge.cs.Dartmouth.EDU>

Ken kindly tells me that both stories are right, though clearly
my impression that my query prompted Ken to write grep is wrong:

        i dont see any differences between our stories.
        you asked and i dug around and found it.

Would we have greps today, had that little incident not occurred?

Doug
