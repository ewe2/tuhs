I have much fondness for some early version of make, perhaps that one.
I carried the source around for 15ish years and spanked people who 
wrote makefiles that didn't work with that make.

Sadly, my team has moved on to GNU make.

No SCCS?  When did Rochkind do SCCS?  Wasn't it early 70's?  I gotta believe
there is SCCS history out there.  And for the record, BitKeeper can read it.
