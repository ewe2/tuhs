I sat down to my first TCP/IP connected host around 1985, and the first =
thing I wanted to do was to configure my first non-UUCP email machine.

After an hour of wading through sendmail=E2=80=99s state machines, I =
gave up wondering why it had to be so hard. =20

In the amazing 184 BSTJ, Dave Presotto had described upas, the =
replacement he built for sendmail.  I loved its ease of use, and it was =
one of the reasons I wanted to join 1127, which I did in late 1987.

I supported email and upas for a number of years, including the {bitnet =
| csnet | uucp | acsnet(?)} -> domain migration.  Like the proverbial =
(and non-existent) boiling frog, this crept up on me: it was a mild =
surprise to realize we were using the other stuff much any more.

Aside from configuration issues, the main complaint with sendmail was =
that it was a huge program running as root, with intentional and =
unintentional holes in.  For many years it was a steady source of =
security problems, including its use in the Morris worm.

That said, sendmail is still running, and handling a fair amount of =
mail, I believe.  A few years ago I checked for recent security problems =
and found none reported.  I think this is a case of =E2=80=9Csoftware =
annealing=E2=80=9D: if you don=E2=80=99t change the specs much, and keep =
working on it, you will eventually get most of the bugs.

As for the configuration: when Norman Wilson moved to Toronto, he =
implemented some form of little language for configuring sendmail, =
treating it somewhat as an assembly language.  I don=E2=80=99t know the =
details, but they might be of interest.
