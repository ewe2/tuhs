A jealous lover, apparently, who knew that he liked apples.

Can't remember where I saw it (it was a book on Turing's life), but given 
that homosexuality was illegal at the time, no doubt the police would've 
had an interest in spreading the story...  You know, "this is what can 
happen to you if you become a homo" etc (despite the fact that it's quite 
common amongst mammals).
