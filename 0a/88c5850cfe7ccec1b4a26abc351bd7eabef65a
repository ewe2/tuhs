I have a possibly-invented memory that the CS department at Edinburgh (and probably others) ended up being called DCS because cs is a valid top-level domain, and so the horrid sendmail magic which worked out whether addresses needed to be turned around (and, I suppose, knew all the TLDs -- it certainly had a huge table of things) would get confused by uk.ac.ed.cs and send things to Czechoslovakia (as then was).
