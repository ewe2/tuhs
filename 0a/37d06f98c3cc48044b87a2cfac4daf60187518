Firstly, thanks to you all for your thanks! I announced minnie as an ftp
site on comp.archives back in May 1991, so she must be one of the longest
continually operating Internet sites.

Yes, I plan on moving to Mailman 3.x. I'm hoping that I can import the raw
TUHS mbox (currently 130Mbytes). This, unfortunately, will break the hyperlinks
in the current mail archive at https://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/

Anyway, first I've got to get SPF, DKIM and friends set up :-)

Cheers, Warren
