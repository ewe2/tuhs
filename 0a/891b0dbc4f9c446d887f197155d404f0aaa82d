Peter Weinberger started and Tom Killian finalized a version of /proc for
the eighth edition that is ioctl-driven. It was done in the early 1980s. I
don't know where the idea originated.

In Plan 9, we (I?) replaced the ioctl interface, which was offensively
non-portable.

your comment about my comment misses the mark; I was not talking about<br>
the origins of /proc. This is probably because I was not clear and<br>
probably because few people realize that the plan 9 process debugging<br>
interface was strings written and read to/from /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/[various<b=

files], rather than something like ptrace.<br>
<br>
The first time I saw that debug-interface-in-proc in plan 9, it made<br>
me think back to the 4.1c bsd manual ptrace comment, and I wondered if<br>
there was any path that led from this man page entry to the ideas in<br>
the plan 9 methods.<br>
<br>
I actually implemented the plan 9 debug model in linux back around<br>
2007, but was pretty sure getting it upstream would never happen, so<br>
let it die.<br>
