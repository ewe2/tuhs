Turns out not linking my a.out was a bad idea; I fixed it by doing this:

exit  = 1.
mount = 21.

	sys mount; rk0+040014; usr+040014
	sys exit

rk0:    </dev/rk0\0>
usr:    </usr\0>

This seems to work.  I think the rk fs image is not right, but Warren seems
to have a grip on that and I'll try his latest mkfs next.
