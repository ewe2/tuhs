Over and over and over again.  You have no idea.

Yeah, I know Bryan pretty well, we used to be neighbors in Noe Valley
and have spent a fair amount of time discussing OS stuff.  Here's 
Bryan, Jeff Bonwick, and Bill Moore at my place in the Santa Cruz 
mountains:

and Bill and Linus talking file systems at the same party:

The best shot was the next morning when the women were gathered around
Linus asking him how he lost weight:

His answer?  "Eat less."  "Did you stop drinking?"  Hell no, I like my beer!"

Fun times.  

I don't agree that Linux is as bad as you have described,
Linus has pretty reasonable taste.

Solaris may be sorted but /proc in Linux is oh-so-much-more-useful.

My view is Linux is pragmatic about stuff, Solaris was dogmatic about it.
Yeah, the latter leads to better thought out stuff but the former tends
to be useful sooner.
