at one point, Bell Labs instituted a new policy to segregate contractors =
by
making them wear a greenish badge. they marked the occasion by sending =
round
a memo showing what the badge would look like.

as soon as i got my copy of the memo, i immediately went to Brian =
Kernighan=E2=80=99s
office so we could ridicule this administrative missive. except, i found =
him cutting
the fake badge out and was faking a G. R. Emlin name plate. Brian =
remarked that
Vyssotsky had already been round earlier suggesting the same idea. the =
fake
badge was good; Jon Bentley used it a couple of times to enter the =
building.
