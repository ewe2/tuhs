Amen, brother Jon, can we get another Amen..

I referred to this previously as the principle of 'least astonishment.'

Again - the argument for doing what he (and his followers did was) 'Gnu is
Not Unix' - but my reply is that they created UNIX when they were done.
They road the research train, then BSD rode the same UNIX train to start
and now ride the UNIX look/work alike, Linux, rides it still.    And
because it was incremental on the past, we get more behind it.

A much as I'm live and left live, and to each her/his own -- if GNU had
been a new system, then I might be a lot more willing to accept that the
argument.  But what was build was (and is) not.  GNU is just the current
and expanded UNIX implementation.  And the so its have the man page being
useless and expecting people to use info in just wrong.   Even if you are
used it it (ok, so you found English speakers when you travelled).

And Ted is not that I don't use the unix documents (full papers) - hey I
do.   That is how I learned to use 'make' when it appeared (or C for that
matter) from documents in /usr/doc. \

What started this whole thread was Doug's comment about how succinct and
to the point man was.  If was a fine interface for >>UNIX<<.   Man (using
roff) was what people expect.  It's not about better or worse -- it worked
and worked well.

As I said, if man had been maintained as the primary >>manual<< style
interface and /usr/doc/<PROG>/foo.ms as the primary scheme (which >>IS<<
what BSD did), then you don't fail the rule of least astonishment.  Then
create a *roff -Tinfo | info_create backend, that produced the info files;
those that want it, get it and love it.   Those that >>expect<< man to work
because its UNIX, get what they expect.  No one is 'astonished.'

Yep.   Metcalfe's Law -- adding too and improving on the past; makes more
people happy.   Yep, it is sometimes 'harder ' for the developer and some
compromises do result.   But the result is a bigger pie and happier group
in total.  Think of the contemporary system to Linux (including Plan9 for
the matter) -- which were 'better' and which are we still using.   Its not
that there are not good ideas.

The 'better than' argument fails when the difference ('betterness') is
shallow and not something that really is remarkable (I like it and use it
is not good enough).   Respecting the past and ensuring the 'old ways' work
is good business.  And that is the problem.   When you are the creator of
the alternate scheme, its hard to not understand how much better something
is.  Being different and better >>sometimes<< can pay off (check out:  =E2=

these things he is talking about is remarkably different --  man vs. info
(or ed/vi vs teco/emacs for that matter, I'm not sure really are/were).
