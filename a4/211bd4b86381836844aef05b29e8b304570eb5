Yes, it does a "$(PAGER) /usr/doc/man/cat1/man.0" :-)

Depends on lots of factors and versions.

Maybe I should have added a smiley. My point was that originally you 
didn't have a man program. You had man-pages, and you looked at them any 
way you preferred. And that is what you observed, but didn't seem to 
grasp, when you looked at V6 (hence the question about where the 
man-program is).

Short answer then: there is none.
