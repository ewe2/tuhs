mmap() did come from those days and minds.

The first appearance of mmap() was in 32V R3, done by John Reiser in =
1981. This is the version of 32V with full demand paging; it implemented =
a unified buffer cache. According to John, that version of mmap() =
already had the modern 6 argument API. John added mmap() because he =
worked with Tenex a lot during his PhD days and missed PMAP. He needed =
some 6 months to design, implement and debug this version of 32V as a =
skunkworks project.

I am trying to revert early VAX SVr1/r2 code to get a better view of =
what 32V R3 looked like, but unfortunately I did not have much time for =
this effort in last couple of months. It would seem that 32V R3 assumed =
that disk blocks and memory pages were the same size (true on a 1980 =
VAX) and with that assumption a unified buffer cache comes natural in =
this code base.

For 4.2BSD initially Joy cs. had a different approach to memory mapped =
files in mind (see the 1981 tech report #4 from CSRG). By the time of =
4.2BSD=E2=80=99s release the manual defined a mmap() system call, but it =
was not implemented and it appears to have been largely forgotten until =
SunOS 4 and dynamic libraries six years later.

In the SysV lineage it is less clear. For sure mmap() is not there, but =
the first implementation of the shmem IPC feature might derive from the =
32V R3 code. On the inside, SVr2 virtual memory appears to implement the =
segments (now called regions) that Joy envisaged for 4.2BSD but did not =
implement.

CB Unix had a precursor to shmem as well, where a portion of system core =
was reserved for shared memory purposes and could be accessed either via =
the /dev/mem device or could be mapped into the PDP-11 address space =
(using 1 of the 8 segment registers for each map). Here too the device =
and the map were unified.

So far, I have not come across any shared library implementations or =
precursors in early Unix prior to SunOS 4.
