OK, something that's not a ping :-)

I'm trying to track down the author of a cartoon that I'd like to use
in my book so that I can try to get permission.  Last one that I need!

It's a cartoon that I only have on paper and don't know where it came
from.  It has two frames, then and now, the first with a bunch of
cavemen grunting awk, grep, mkdir, yank, the second with a bunch of
people sitting at computers uttering the same.

I recently stumbled upon something that said that these were in a book
called "UNIX Primer PLUS".  Anybody have a copy of that?  If so, can
you please check to see if that's the original or whether they got it
from somewhere else?

Thanks,
	Jon
