True, but what I believe Clem meant was "binary data".  He did write 
"raw data".

Actually, for both, explicitly in the standard.  The standard (which I 
have in front of me, RS232C August 1969 reaffirmed June 1981) does 
indeed explain at length how to use it for half duplex turnaround but 
also indicates how to use it for flow control.  It states the use on 
one-way channels and full-duplex channels to stop transmission in a 
paragraph before the paragraph discussing half duplex.

Except for ITU-T V.250, which admittedly is a Recommendation not a Standard.
