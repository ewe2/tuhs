Did you happen to find out what GWRL stands for, in the the comments at
the top of early versions of cut.c and paste.c?

/* cut : cut and paste columns of a table (projection of a relation) (GWRL) */
/* Release 1.5; handles single backspaces as produced by nroff    */
/* paste: concatenate corresponding lines of each file in parallel. Release 1.4 (GWRL) */
/*        (-s option: serial concatenation like old (127's) paste command */

For that matter, what's the "old (127's) paste command" it refers to?
