Joy=E2=80=99s original 2BSD tape will give you UCB Pascal.   For anything e=
lse
you'll probably want to find some of the old USENIX tapes.   Warren has
some of them, although I'm not sure he has the complete set.

BTW: The Cooper Union folks got the DEC Fortran to run at one point.   But
it was quite a task, as it involved running a partial PDP-10/TOPS-10 user
space emulator so they could run the DEC BLISS-10 compiler [this was long
before simh].

I also think that ultrix11 binaries will on V7 so there are other language
processors there including ftn. You=E2=80=99ll need to bring the dec linker=
 over
from Ultrix to use them as they output objs that are not the same although
the final output is an a.out.
