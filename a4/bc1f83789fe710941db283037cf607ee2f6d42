Indeed they weren't, and that's how we know that 1-based indexing doesn't require any overhead given a reasonably good compiler.  If you'd gone to people writing big CFD simulations in 1975 and told them that by using a version of FORTRAN which had 0-based arrays they could save any significant runtime at all then they would have changed to it without a thought.  But they didn't.
