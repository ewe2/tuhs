Subject: [TUHS] Searching for 9th Edition Research Unix mail / Mail / mailx
Message-ID: <20170330111601.xKVES%steffen@sdaoden.eu>

I am maintaining a BSD Mail derivative and one goal of the project
is to have the complete history of Unix mail and BSD Mail in the
repository.

There yet exists a [timeline] branch, which has been fed with data
from TUHS (thank you!) and CSRG; but it is coarse and further linear
history and so the new V8 and V10 cannot be inserted, i will need
to add new [unix-mail] and [bsd-Mail] (and maybe [bsd-csrg] with
all commits preserved, like Spinellis did so in the Unix-history
repository).

Thanks to TUHS the former can be almost completed, except that
there is no trace of 9th Edition mail.  It would be fantastic if
finally this project could provide the complete history of Unix
mail.  I would be thankful for informations where to get a copy of
9th Edition mail.  Thank you.

P.S.: apologizing for capturing the other thread with such
a coarse message.
