I learned the other day that array indexes in some languages start at 1
instead of 0. This seems to be an old trend that changed around the 70s?
Who started this? Why was the change made?

It seems to have come about around the same time as C, but interestingly
enough Lua is kinda in between (you can start an array at 0 or 1).
Smalltalk can probably have a 0 base index just by it's nature, but I
wonder whether that would work in a 40 year old interpreter.
