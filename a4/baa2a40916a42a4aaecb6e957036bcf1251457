The file "sendmail.fc" is just the dump of the heap from sendmail.
This method existed since a long time.

BTW: undump(1) has been announced on a Sun User Group in 1987, but the
next year, SunOS-4.0 came out and made things much harder to implement.

I did never see an updated undump(1) source that would be able to deal with 
SunOS-4.0 and it's shared libraries. Does it exist?
