As a customer, back in 1992 in the UK: DEC sold us Ultrix DECstations runnin=

e for peanuts. So we ran this research cluster with one Alpha 3000/600 and t=
wo Alpha 3000/400 running OSF/1 T1.0 and the DECstations on Ultrix, compilin=
g everything on Ultrix and "mx"ing into OSF/1 until, with OSF/1 2.0 the "upg=
rades" showed up and we ended up with a beautiful Alpha cluster which was th=
e envy of the college. They then spread like wildfire when engineering depts=
 tried their code on our cluster=E2=80=A6

For us the MIPS DECstations were literally placeholders for the Alphas we'd b=
e getting with the trade-in! One of the DECstations is still with me because=
 it turned out that DEC did not want back the huge stack of DECstations we h=
ad piled up for the trade-in!
