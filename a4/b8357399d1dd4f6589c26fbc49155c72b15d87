Yes, those are great papers - unfortunately behind a paywall.

There is a great 1994 video on Youtube by Sandy Fraser himself that more =
or less follows the 1993 paper:=20

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DojRtJ1U6Qzw

As Doug mentioned on this list, Sandy Fraser passed away earlier this =
month.

In the past years I=E2=80=99ve worked on understanding (early) Datakit =
and Sandy Fraser and his wife were most kind with assistance looking for =
papers. I=E2=80=99ve also benefitted from the input of Bill Marshall and =
of course Doug McIlroy. I=E2=80=99ll share my summary of Research =
Datakit in a separate post.
