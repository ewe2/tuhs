Subject: [TUHS] Unix v6 File System information
Message-ID: <56C9873A.1020208@gmail.com>

All,

Is there a good source of information about the Unix v6 filesystem 
outside of the source code itself? Also, is there a source for the 
history of the early Unix filesystems from v6 onward?

Thanks,

Will
