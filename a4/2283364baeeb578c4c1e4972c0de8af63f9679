That's funny, I was just talking to my older son yesterday.  We had the
chat about how much you could get done in a semester in college, a buddy
and I did about 80% of an Ada compiler.  It was a lot.  I told my kid 
that industry is different, it moves way slower and that is because
there is a huge difference between something you get done in a few months
and throw away and something that you are going to hand off to users.
Error handling and messages matter a lot.  Backwards compatibility 
matters a lot.

Isn't Adam working on v7?  If so, not so great error messages are
sort of understood, it was early times.  They got better.
