I do not have any experience either way. I have never checked this. I'm 
just saying that it don't make sense in my head, and the processor 
handbook do not describe such a property of SPL. But now that I know, 
I'm going to try and find out.

It might be correct. I'm just surprised if so, since there is no 
technical need for SPL to act that way. And having SPL behave 
differently than all other instructions means extra work for the people 
who wrote the microcode.

It would also be interesting if anyone can come up with a good reason 
why SPL should work that way.
