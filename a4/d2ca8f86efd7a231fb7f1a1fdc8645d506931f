I think I would amend this to say something along the lines of, "we have
40+ years of experience clearly showing that dangerous languages cannot be
used safely in critical areas without a disproportionate amount of care and
effort, despite the best efforts and skill of our best programmers."

Moreover, as Steve said, what we consider "programming" these days is
different than it was even 20 years ago: the programs we write are largely
glue tying together a dizzying array of complicated and powerful libraries.
There was a time that whenever I wanted a linked list in C, well, I'd just
add a 'next' pointer to a struct; if I wanted a tree, I'd add 'left' and
'right' pointers. For the *vast* majority of programmers, those days are
gone but our languages don't really reflect that.
