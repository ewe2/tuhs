So only Noel and Clem have expressed an interest so far. It's free, BTW, 
including shipping. I want it to go to a good home ;) It's still sealed 
in it's anti-static wrap and comes with a (short) ribbon cable.

BTW, I also have a VT100 logic board that is marked as "brand new" by me 
from about 20 years ago.
