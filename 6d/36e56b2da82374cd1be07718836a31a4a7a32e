Yes, I love it. Unfortunately upstreaming the or1k patches
to GCC failed due to copyright assignment issues or it
would be running debian now. I run a bare minimum static
cross linux from scratch on it.

This builds the toolchain, kernel and a few bits like simh

This continues from above to add more things to sysroot
https://github.com/dugoh/srb

This fork ties it together

Apologies in advance for the horrendous state of my commit
history. I abuse github as a scratch pad and CD pipeline,
(github -> travis -> gh-pages) and never bothered with any
of the courtesies of open source development.

The network back-end is here

Easy to set up if you do Docker and otherwise not that hard.
