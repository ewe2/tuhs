I'd think it was.  SCO owns nothing except a license, and whatever it
did own, its predecessor in interest Caldera licensed away under a
BSD license.

Whether anyone wants to do the work is another question.
Digital preservation stands on three legs: right, power, and concern,
and the greatest of these is concern.

If a soldier is asked why he kills people who have done him no harm, or a
terrorist why he kills innocent people with his bombs, they can always
reply that war has been declared, and there are no innocent people in an
enemy country in wartime.  The answer is psychotic, but it is the answer
that humanity has given to every act of aggression in history.  --Northrop Frye
