Regarding the ARPA network at UCB, see ARPANET Completion Report at 
http://walden-family.com/bbn/arpanet-completion-report.pdf PDF page 199 
"ARPA NETWORK, LOGICAL MAP, SEPTEMBER 1973" shows LBL with 316-based 
IMP. The next page (June 1974) shows it (LBL IMP) linked with UCB with a 
PDP-11 "v".

I don't know the key for "v" but maybe means "very distant host" as 
defined in Report 1822 Appendix F (PDF page 151 at 
http://walden-family.com/impcode/BBN1822_Jan1976.pdf ), If that is what 
it is, the BBN 1822 Section F.3.4 suggests "[e]ither an EIA RS232C 
interface or the special Bell 303 [modem] interface can be used. Speeds 
up to 230.4 kilobits/second are permitted. ... At the Host site there 
will be a mating full-duplex modem."

"UCB" was removed from the Oct. 1976 map, but it still shows a PDP-11 
"v" link. And the remote link removed from map in March 1977.

Allman told me the INGRES link was a "VDH (Very Distant Host) interface, 
which was essentially a 9600 baud modem that took up most of a rack, 
plus a rather large card that plugged into the UNIBUS on the PDP-11."

He also told me the Unix v6 Arpanet code was from San Diego. (I still 
don't know about the earlier connection but I assume was not on Unix.)
