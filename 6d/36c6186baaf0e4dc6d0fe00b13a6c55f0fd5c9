Subject: [TUHS] etymology of cron
Message-ID: <201512230027.tBN0RK7A009917@tahoe.cs.Dartmouth.EDU>

I had never doubted that "cron" was a contraction of "chrono-".
Wikipedia, however, offered several folk acronyms on a par
with it. Brian asked Ken, who confirmed,

"cron comes from the prefix (greek?) for time.
it should have been chron, but i never could spell."

I edited Wikipedia to expunge the nonsense. Amusingly that
makes the article less "verifiable" because there had been
literature citations for the nonsense, but there is none
for the fact.
