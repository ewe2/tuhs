In Oxford American Dictionary
eunuch (spelled yoo-nuk) . Is it the source of this tale ?

In Webster 3 edition (Koenemann, about 2000 pages)) unix is not mentioned
eunuch (spelled yu-nik,yu-nek)

Unix was Unics at the beginning(uniplexed information computer system)
as opposed to Multics (multiplexed information computer system),
last was working even in 1980.Even name suggests, that Unics was a 
simplified concept, of course at that time.
As You know most modern Unix boxes are multiCPU systems etc ,etc.
