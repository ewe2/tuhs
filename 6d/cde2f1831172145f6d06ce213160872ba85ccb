Never heard of Claude Shannon. So a good opportunity to do some
searching reading to 'catch up'.

Interesting person and this quota tends to make him my type of guy
"I just wondered how things were put together.
â€“ C.E. Shannon"

Now wondering if I should register for this THORIAC project or just
read some more and do it. Not in the mood for learning Python I'd
probably do some fumbling in C.
