(From a mainly Linux background - I'm curious where the rust stains are)

Everything is still a file. I've got some arguments about the Linux kernel
build process (having to bootstrap your config system seems wrong to me -
or creating a totally new format for the config - kconfig) and don't really
appreciate their stance on security and don't really appreciate a thousand
files in etc vs using /usr/local/etc for most things.

I guess one could argue that sysfs is a bit much, and I've obviously seen
the arguments over systemd (and I admit that could've been handled better
both politically and technically) but all in all, I think that both are
decent systems.

But the system itself (and distros) seem to be pretty Unix like to me. Of
course, this is from someone who uses the hell out of the shell
autocomplete (many zsh compdef and the like) and opens new files in vim
using the servername of an existing vim instance and loves
scripts/libraries that go outside of UTF to display cool things (namely
progress bars and select bubbles) and abuses bash extglob and sits in a
split tmux (sometimes with a split vim), so... Maybe the old school Unix
mentality is lost on me.
