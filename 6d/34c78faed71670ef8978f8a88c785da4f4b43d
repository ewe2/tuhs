The two-instruction sequence is:

	movb	tty+3(r1),0f / put clist id in sleep argument
	jsr	r0,sleep; 0:..

The "0:" on the second line is a label and it is referenced by the "0f"
in the first line.  The first line is putting a value into the argument
being passed to the sleep subroutine.  Self-modifying code.

The ".." assembles to a 0.

With the incorrect code, "0" assembled to a 0 and ".." assembled to
a 0, so there was one extra word of zeroes, and the return from the
sleep would have executed it (halt) instead of the "br 1b" on the
next line.
