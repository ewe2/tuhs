Thanks, that was very interesting. Indeed, it sounds like at attempt
to bring a TENEX-style user experience to Unix.

Also interesting was the short article about, "the Berkeley 11/70 System"
with notes from Ken.  The description of the UID scheme to separate
students from "regular" users and the note that "the group concept is
about to disappear" were particularly intriguing; clearly an evolutionary
dead end, but striking in that this must have yielded a much greater
level of isolation. Also, the note about per-directory quotas (as opposed
to per-user/group quotas) was interesting.

I wonder what other early attempts at hardening the system for
educational environments were made that similarly didn't make it
in the long haul, and to what extent such efforts have survived?
