+1 Your right in both cases.The only thing I will point out about the
mobile systems have a unix core - it is extremely hidden and made to be in
accessible which to me is exactly what unix was originally working against.

Instead of =E2=80=9Caccess methods=E2=80=9D of the 60s we have frameworks. =
 We lost
simplicity, clarity, and direct access for dancing colors on the LCD and a
GUI.  Yes they sell a lot of devices but I=E2=80=99m not sure we are better=
 off.
