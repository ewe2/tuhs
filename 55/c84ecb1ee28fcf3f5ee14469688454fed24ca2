Does that mean that you couldn't access AIX/370 from a traditional 
mainframe terminal?

That seems bizarre to me.  But it does sound like some other strange 
things I've heard come out of IBM before.

What would that have done?  Are you meaning an app that would run on 
non-AIX/370 OSs that could then act similar to the i860/i386 client / 
node?  (Was it trying to emulate a traditional serial dumb terminal?)
