Subject: [pups] Blinky lights, and E-11
Message-ID: <002101c2e2ad$75301460$16c7580c@who5>

Hello from Gregg C Levine
In the documentation for E-11, John Wilson, describes the "blinky
lights", essentially eight LEDs attached to the printer port of an
IBM-PC that's running his emulator. 

Has anyone ever built one of those things, using either a PC board
blank from John Wilson, or decided to build one on his own? For that
matter, has anyone actually used it, to assist in the debugging of a
program, running on his emulator?

I'll probably e-mail John Wilson about this one directly, but, has
anyone written a custom plug-in, that would have the printer port,
pose as an I/O port for the emulator?
