I should have also said that RFC791 is where IPv4 pretty much becomes 
what we can recognize, and what will probably work against other 
machines today.
And RFC791 is dated September 1981.

So I have this problem with people who say that they implemented TC/IP 
in 1978 for some reason. :-) Especially if they say they followed some 
RFC, and it was working well in heterogeneous networks.

I don't want to claim that people didn't do the networking, but I don't 
think it's correct to say that it was TCP/IP, as we know it today. It 
was either some other protocol (like NCP) or some other version of IP, 
which was not even published as an RFC.

Or else the RFCs in the IETF archives have been falsified with regards 
to their dates.
