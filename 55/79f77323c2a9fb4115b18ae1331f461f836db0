His statement was made in 1977 (ironically, the same year as the Apple

(Not really that relevant, since he was apparently talking about 'smart

perhaps why that quotation was taken up.)

There was eventually a single-chip micro version, done in the mid-70's; it
was used in a number of DEC word-processing products.
