I've lugged these around for 35-ish years.  I'd like to seem them 
scanned and stored someplace as permanent as can be found, so if
someone/anyone could tell me how to facilitate that, I'll package
them for shipping.

My apologies if this has already been done and I'm simply not aware of it.

I have other stuff that probably needs the same treatment, but
excavating the alluvial layers that have accumulated will take time.
