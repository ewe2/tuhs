Mike Lesk had a really good rap about his work on Library information
systems and the work they did at Bell (or maybe one of the schools of
library sciences).

The principle was, that "simple" users wanted nested menu and "power"
users wanted commands. They did A/B testing and a bunch of work to
show that if you trained people in the keystrokes for the commandline,
they got significantly more productive.

Mike also said (I may be mis-remembering, but this is what I took from
the conversation) that people's prior experiental sense of what they
wanted had as much influence on what they thought, as the quality of
the system.

So if (like me) you walked into the SOS room at the lab, on a
Dec-10... you wound up wired to go with ed/ex/vi family interaction.
If you walked into the teco room you came out more wired for emacs. I
think this is very probably true, purely on my own sample of one. If
I'd walked into the LISP room, I would probably now be a lowly paid
quant in a small bank, failing badly instead of having walked into the
pascal room, and being an imperative language person earning the huge
bucks coding menu systems. No wait.. thats not right..
