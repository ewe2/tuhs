Subject: [TUHS] Lions' V6 source code
Message-ID: <20040615153544.21d9dd32.macbiesz@optonline.net>

Hi,

What version, exactly, of 6th Edition source code is contained in the Lions' commentary booklets? I took a look at the version available for download at [http://v6.cuzuco.com/v6.pdf], but it does not seem to match the source code in the TUHS archives.

If the source code was in fact modified by Lions, are there any machine-readable versions available?

Regards,

Maciek.
