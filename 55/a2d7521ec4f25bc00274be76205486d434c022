We're probably well off topic now but...

Many years ago I ran into Bob Dewar on a visit to Cambridge University and
we got to talking. He said that the original implementation of SPITBOL, for
the System/360, was in assembler (of course), and written by him and
Belcher (?). The story he told was that they wrote it all down first, put
it on punch cards, and sent it to the IBM machine. The next day they got
back a listing with a bunch of errors. They iterated. By the fourth
round=E2=80=94fifth day=E2=80=94they had a working SPITBOL.

I still marvel at the productivity and precision of his generation of
programmers.
