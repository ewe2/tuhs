Thanks Clem. I know that in theory, this should be super 
straightforward, but it seems that theory and reality are uncomfortable 
with each other around me and this question. I've tried maybe 7 dozen 
different approaches to getting 1bsd.tar.gz files to be accessible to v6 
with more than a handful of files at a time. The vast majority of these 
methods were flawed in their conception, but some "should have worked" 
by all accounts, and yet, no joy (pun intended). I can use the paper 
tape punch method or others to copy one file at a time, but that's 
tedious. All of the other methods folks have suggested, I've tried, but 
frustratingly, it just doesn't seem possible to perform the "back in the 
day" install of 1bsd on v6:

Berkeley UNIX Software Tape
     Jan 16, 1978    TP 800BPI

     To extract contents do:
       tp xm ./setup; sh setup; tp xm

     See accompanying document
Second label on the tape:

     The contents of this tape are
     distributed to UNIX licensees
     only, subject to the software
     agreement you have with Western
     Electric and an agreement with
     the University of California.


For example, it seems like using tar2mt on the gunzipped tarball and 
attaching to tm0 should work, but when running tp xm on it, it fails 
(something about directory checksum). I know the tarball is good, not so 
sure about the mt image (tried it with default blocksize and 512 as well).

In the absence of positive confirmation of someone else's successful 
experience installing 1bsd, I backburner this problem every so often and 
carry on with my other investigations. When someone suggests something 
new, or I think of some new angle, I fire up the sim and try installing 
again. Hence, my occasional queries that seem to be retreads.

Now that I have more experience with the SimH simulator, PDP-11 
architecture/programming, and success at moving files around DEC OS'es, 
I feel oh so close to a breakthrough on this one sticky problem :). 
Hence my latest interest in the file system. I figure if I can 
understand the format I may be able to check the conversion of the 
tarball to a v6 consumable filesystem and determine why it's not working.

Why, oh why, didn't someone save a tape image, rather than a tarball, 
given that tar on v6 was so hokey?!

Thanks,

Will
