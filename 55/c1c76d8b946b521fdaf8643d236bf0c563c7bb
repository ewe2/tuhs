Remembering the blocking and the actor's names for a play you saw thirty
years ago would be an impressive feat, but I would argue that it is much
more beneficial in the long run to remember the basic plot and the message
that the production was attempting to convey.

Indeed, that's a nearly impossible task now.  We have transitioned to a
world where you can say, "here's my sketch for a program that I think would
be useful," and that sketch is either a basic chapter outline or you've
only finished writing chapter one.  You put it up on Github, try to give it
a little publicity, and hope that others can share your vision or at least
provide constructive criticism.
