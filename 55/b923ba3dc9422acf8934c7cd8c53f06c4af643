No, because you'd be assigning the contents i.e. the address (or however 
references are implemented on a given architecture) to a character; 
whether the fundamental type is "char*" or ("mostly char but it's really a 
pointer") is the same.

Then again, I learned ALGOLW (and PASCAL) before I learned C, and it has a 
"REFERENCE" type...
