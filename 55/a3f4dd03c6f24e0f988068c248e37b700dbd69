Quite.

One point being that one could fork/exec a program with those fd's attached
to stdin/stdout and it could operate as a normal filter, w/o having to
understand it was using a socket.

(i.e. closing stdout [hence triggering a FIN], while still reading from stdin)

Plus various other games achievable by replumbing fd's.
