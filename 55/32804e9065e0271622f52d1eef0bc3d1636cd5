I used to know CVS quite well.  Then I switched to mercurial
(for my own projects).  Then to git.  git has its problems but
it has worked well enough.  With just a few commands you can
get a lot done with it.  If you rely on/ contribute to any
open source projects, you pretty much have to know it these
days.
