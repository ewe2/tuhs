Macbook pro with OS X for personal and work machines. Work's systems are a little CentOS 6, a lot of CentOS 7 and some CoreOS, all on bare metal (no virtualization).

Most of my playing around/experimenting is in CentOS 7 VMware VMs run out of Vagrant (to make spinup/teardown much faster and git-trackable).
