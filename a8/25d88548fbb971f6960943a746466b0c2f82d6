I actually purchased several copies of Coherent when it was first released
and used it as printer servers for a bunch of inexpensive Centronics based
printers. lpd based server to server transfers. Took the printing burden
off the main systems. Someone came out with a network based print spooler
box (Milan ??) later on which I switched over to after MW passed into
obscurity.
