Well, I could tell you exactly how the V6 FS worked, but it would take me 
over an hour to type it all in, so hopefully someone will come forward.

Dir entry: 14 chars (non-null term), plus 16 bit index into inode.

Inode table: a bit weird, involving single/double/triple block addresses 
into the disk itself.

And then we have the superblock (yep, only one, in those days).
