2.8BSD was supposed to be the last PDP-11 release: A final wrapup of
everything, according to the release notes. However, there were a lot of
PDP-11s in specialized niches that weren't easily replaced by more modern
hardware, so 2.9, 2.10 and 2.11 happened as well. The formality of the
release seemed to diminish a bit at each step (though that may just be my
perceptions). By the time we arrive at 2.11BSD, the tapes were produced by
USENIX where you had to send proof of license to get the tape... These
releases were driven by Seismo, and the USGS and/or military deployments
from everything I've read...
