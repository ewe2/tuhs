The Sparc 20 includes the double-buffered graphics board.  Thanks to an
unnamed employee, I got the code to do a kernel mod so that I can run
SunView on the front buffer and X on the rear buffer and switch between
the two by running the mouse off of the side of the screen.

I probably have installation media around for both of these systems.
Which means that I also have a QIC-150 drive to go with 'em.  And a
stack of QIC-150 and QIC-50 tapes that I've been wanting to get rid
of but haven't managed to procure a good bulk eraser yet.  Also may
have Sun DDS-2, DDS-3, and DDS-4 DAT drives; will have to look.  I
also have one of the Archive Python DAT drives with the special SGI
firmware that lets the DDS layer be turned off so that you can read
and write audio DATs; that's currently loaned out and I'd need to
check the status of it.
