I=E2=80=99ll be 67 for the 2038 bug.  Plenty of time to charge =
ridiculous hourly rates for being the old curmudgeon who still keeps a =
bunch of these systems running in his house for some combination of fun, =
nostalgia, and challenge.

My gut tells me that this is going to be far less of a big deal than =
2000.

To (somewhat inaccurately) summarize: the problem with 2000 is that =
there was (and is, and will be in 2038) a whole bunch of COBOL doing the =
Really Important Stuff with two-digit year fields.

Whereas, time_t is basically internal, right?

Software is forever, but hardware, even with the best of intentions, =
after about 40 years or so, starts getting difficult to keep running =
(/pats Atari 2600 affectionately).

So if you *can* rebuild the software for a newer architecture=E2=80=A6then=
 suddenly there=E2=80=99s a wider time_t and the 33d bit is suddenly 1 =
but nothing breaks.  And if you can=E2=80=99t, you=E2=80=99re probably =
by that point running it in emulation anyway, at which point your =
emulation environment can know that 1/1/1970 is really whatever/2038, =
and your software is partying like it was just 1969.  If you have need =
to maintain linearly incrementing time in your application, you do the =
sliding window thing that we did with COBOL and Y2K.

Aside: the COBOL problem was made worse by IBM=E2=80=99s (IMHO very =
good) decision to provide problem-state instruction compatibility all =
the way from the (1964, IIRC) 360 to the present day, so for more than =
half a decade, you can just drop your Big Important COBOL onto the =
current incarnation of the 3x0/z and it=E2=80=99ll be perfectly happy.
