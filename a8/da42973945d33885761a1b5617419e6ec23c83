That's not right.  Yes, the ASR33 runs at 110 baud (10cps), but all - 
including mine and those of my friends -  take more like half a dozen 
character times to perform a CR from the right hand side.  Moreover, the 
time it takes depends in a non-linear fashionon how far along the line 
the printhead has travelled; it's driven by a spring and decelerated and 
stopped by an air dashpot.  Even an LF takes more than two character 
times.  That's why ASR33 drivers send a string of nulls after a CR. 
Many are smart enough to send the LF instead of the first null, if they 
see that LF is the first character after CR.

The ASR33 friction feed models, but not the sprocket fed ones, can be 
configured to do that but AFAIR only at the 72nd character position at 
the end of a line.

That's correct.  Selectrics have a RETURN key, which performs carriage 
return and linefeed, and on mine there was a switch for single/double 
line spacing too.  I no longer have one, but I used to have two.
