I did a little googling earlier this weekend and I couldn't find
much.  T.R. Bashkow is "Theodore", he was at Columbia (emeritus
there).  For J. DeFelice I could find nothing.  There are lots of
hits for DeFelice in general, and a few academic papers in biology
for a J. DeFelice but I couldn't find much computer science or
bell labs related.
