Linux.  I have a mixture of (legacy) CentOS, (X)Ubuntu (current) and 
Gentoo (future).  #ImANTIsystemd

I can use just about any ""unix and prefer the GNU tool chain.

I *LOVE* to chain commands together to do various things.  I feel like I 
can get the ""unix environment to do my bidding.  Most of the time.  ;-)

As long as you can get the job done, I don't care what you use to do it. 
  To each his / her own.  (Unless I have to help support it, then I care.)
