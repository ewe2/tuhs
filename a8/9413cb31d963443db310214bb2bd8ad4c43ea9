A fd at EOF is considered by select and friends to be ready, as it is

A Unix zealot, having heard that Master Foo was wise in the Great Way, came
to him for instruction. Master Foo said to him:

=E2=80=9CWhen the Patriarch Thompson invented Unix, he did not understand i=
t. Then
he gained in understanding, and no longer invented it.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CWhen the Patriarch McIlroy invented the pipe, he knew that it woul=
d
transform software, but did not know that it would transform mind.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CWhen the Patriarch Ritchie invented C, he condemned programmers to=
 a
thousand hells of buffer overruns, heap corruption, and stale-pointer bugs.=
=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CTruly, the Patriarchs were blind and foolish!=E2=80=9D

The zealot was greatly angered by the Master's words.

=E2=80=9CThese enlightened ones,=E2=80=9D he protested, =E2=80=9Cgave us th=
e Great Way of Unix.
Surely, if we mock them we will lose merit and be reborn as beasts or
MCSEs.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CIs your code ever completely without stain and flaw?=E2=80=9D dema=
nded Master Foo.

=E2=80=9CNo,=E2=80=9D admitted the zealot, =E2=80=9Cno man's is.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CThe wisdom of the Patriarchs=E2=80=9D said Master Foo, =E2=80=9Cwa=
s that they *knew* they
were fools.=E2=80=9D

Upon hearing this, the zealot was enlightened.
