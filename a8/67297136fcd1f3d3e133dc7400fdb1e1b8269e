   Subject: A cameo by UNIX in BSTJ

Some months ago I faced a flight from Denmark to NZ and back again,
so I bought a Kobo eBook reader and reformatted the entire BSTJ to fit
the screen.

That gave me about 100k "pages" to read, plenty for my NZ-flights
and a large number of otherwise wasted moments since then.  Highly
recommeded.

Recently I came over what I belive is the first mention of UNIX in BSTJ.

We all know about the v57i6, July-August 1978 "UNIX Time-Sharing System"
issue, but it transpires that UNIX made a cameo two years earlier
in an article about compression-schemes for TeleFax:

Enjoy,

Poul-Henning
