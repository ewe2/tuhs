Subject: [TUHS] RIP Marvin Minsky
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.21.1801240920410.74252@aneurin.horsfall.org>

We lost AI pioneer Marvin Minsky on this day in 2016 from a cerebral 
haemorrhage, aged 88.  Amongst other things, along with John McCarthy he 
co-founded the MIT AI Lab, co-invented the Logo "turtle", was mentioned in 
Arthur C. Clarke's novel "2001: A Space Odyssey", and built the first 
randomly wired neural network learning machine, SNARC, in 1951.

He is now thought to be cryogenically preserved as "Patient 144" at Alcor 
(he started cooling on 27/1/2016).
