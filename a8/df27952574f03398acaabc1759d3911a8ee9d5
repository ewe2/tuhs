I too remember TECO.  In my TOPS-10 days I was quite a whiz at it.

Then I encountered UNIX and ed, and never looked back.  Cryptic
programmability is fun, but a simple but well-chosen set of
commands including the g/v pair made me more efficient in the end.

it could just be that ed is a better fit for the shape of my brain.
C struck me similarly.
