No, the PDP-6 and PDP-10 have identical instruction sets, and in general, a
program that will run on one, will run on the other. See "decsystem10 System
Reference Manual" (DEC-10-XSRMA-A=D", pg. 2-72., which provides a 7-instruction
code fragment which allows a program to work out if it's running on a PDP-6, a
KA10, or a KI10.

The KA10 is a re-implementation (using mostly B-series Flip Chips) of the
PDP-6 (which was built out of System Modules - the predecessor to Flip Chips).
