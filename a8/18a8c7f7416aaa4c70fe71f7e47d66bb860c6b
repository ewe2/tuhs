Is that online? If not, any chances you can make it so?

You're in luck.

To start with, check out:

  http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=SRI-NOSC/dmr/oldstuff

which contains the drivers tiu.c, mpx.c - I'm not sure what other files there
are part of it?

I'm not at all clear how this stuff got there - someone at Bell must have just
dumped the contents of the 'dmr' directory, and sent it all off?


The PWB1-based MIT systems also have a lot of the Spider software (although it
was never used). It's a slightly different version than the one above: 'diff'
shows that 'tiu.c' is almost identical, but mpx.c has more significant
differences.

It also contains man pages, and sources for some (?) user programs; I have the
source and manpage for 'nfs'. What other names should I be looking for? (The
man page for 'nfs' doesn't list any other commands.) I'll put them up
momentarily.

In the meantime, I'll append the 'tiu' man page. There isn't one for mpx,
alas.
