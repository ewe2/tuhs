While investigating building a Ultrix V3.1 tape I discovered that the file
on the archive is corrupt.

	Distributions/dec/Ultrix-3.1/ultrix-3.1-bootape.tar.gz

	File 34: The ULTRIX-11 /usr file system in dump/restor format

Wilko Bulte sent that in to the PUPS Archive. Wilko, do you still have the
tape. Can you try to read it again?!

Cheers,
	Warren

Warren,

When I untar the .tgz I get files named tapeblock[0-33]
In tapeblock4 is an index of the original tape, which lists the
various files on the tape. These are numbered *1* til *34*

I think this is just an off by one thing, because there is no tapeblock34
at all.

Please check if this is the case. I don't have any PDP operational so I
cannot verify the contents of tapeblock33. But I'm pretty sure this is /usr
