I don't really know enough about filesystem internals to comment on the
design one way or another.  I can say that Oberlin College Computer Science
switched to using ZFS with snapshots in 2008 or so (on Solaris 10) and it
greatly simplified restoring from backups.  Home directories had weekly
snapshots taken, rolling over a month or two, and it was a godsend when a
student (or a professor...) accidentally deleted something important.  No
more trawling through backup tapes by the admin to restore the file you
wanted, it could easily be taken from an on-disk snapshot.  Obviously it
required a certain greater amount of disk space, but I contend that it was
worth it.
