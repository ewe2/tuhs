This is quite strange for me. Without looking at your system I can only
suspect it has something to do with multithreading.

If I do two different commands as root, with firefox pid here
.eq. 12331, as above:

=>  (500 15):    lsof -p 12331 | wc -l
402

=>  (500 17):   lsof | awk '$2==12331' | wc -l
22055

The first column gives a name, and in second case it not always is
'firefox'. I am yet to study manpage for lsof and play with it, but it
surely shows interesting things.

On my system, when firefox gets killed, 'free' shows a difference - if
I recall, free mem increases by the size of rss plus all the stuff
which was opened and released from buffers. I did not pay much
attention, I assumed numbers would match and this is what they
probably did :-).

OS on my box used to report to me as Debian, and still does, but some
years ago I have decided to skip the usual system upgrade, and after
some more time I started to upgrade various elements by hand. So it is
more like a tattered patchwork right now. But it does what I expect,
hopefully.

Yeah, strange.

Hard to tell - first I would like to learn where the hundred-giga rss
came from...
