maybe if interest, i have a copy of an article by sandy fraser, =E2=80=9Cear=
ly experiments with time division networks=E2=80=9D from ieee networks, jan 1=
993, pp12-26.

this is a high level paper and describes spider, datakit, incon.=20

it may have little new but i felt it had a lot of good background and a usef=
ul references list.

i am wary of scanning it as its the ieee...

>=20
> Context is as follows:
>=20
> - The Spider network guaranteed reliable, in-order delivery of packets at t=
he TIU interface. There does not seem to have been a standard host end-to-en=
d protocol, although applications did of course contain sanity checks (see f=
or instance the =E2=80=98nfs=E2=80=99 source here: http://chiselapp.com/user=
/pnr/repository/Spider/tree?ci=3Dtip)
>=20
> - Datakit dropped the reliable delivery part (although it did retain the i=
n-order guarantee) and moved this responsibility to the host. It is the (ear=
ly) evolution of the related protocol that I=E2=80=99m trying to dig up.
>=20
> - 7th Edition appears to have had a (serial line based) Datakit connection=
. Datakit drivers are not in the distributed files, but its tty.h file has d=
efines for several Datakit related  constants. Also, as the first Datakit sw=
itches became operational at Murray Hill in =E2=80=9978 or =E2=80=9979, it s=
eems a reasonable assumption that the Research code base included drivers & p=
rotocols for it around that time.
>=20
> - After that the trail continues with the 8th edition which has a stream f=
ilter (dkp.c) for the =E2=80=9CNew Datakit Protocol=E2=80=9D: http://chisela=
pp.com/user/pnr/repository/v8unix/artifact/01b4f6f05733aba5  This suggests t=
hat there was an =E2=80=9COld Datakit Protocol=E2=80=9D as well - if so, thi=
s may have been the protocol in use at the time of 7th Edition.
>=20
> The =E2=80=9CNew Datakit Protocol=E2=80=9D appears to be (more or less) th=
e same as what was later called URP (Universal Receiver Protocol). At the ti=
me of Plan9 its IL/IP protocol appears to have been designed as an equivalen=
t for URP/Datakit. The early protocols where apparently (co-)designed by Gre=
g Chesson and maybe also stood at the base of his later XTP protocol work.
>=20
> Any recollections about the early history and evolution of this Datakit pr=
otocol are much appreciated. Also, if the source to the 7th Edition Datakit n=
etwork stack survived I=E2=80=99d love to hear.
