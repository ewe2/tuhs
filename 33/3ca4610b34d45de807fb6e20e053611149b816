One might easily consider Warren's Charter definition, following the wording
closely, to mean that it includes successor derivatives of V1-V7.  That
might particularly include the BSD's, be they original CSRG code or
derived code, which can be traced back through CSRG, to V1-V7.

All of the x86ish derivations can be traced back to Jolitz's port which
had its beginnings around 4.3 or 4.3-Tahoe, if I am remembering the source
tree structure in one of my source trees.

Thus, technically, a direct lineal descent case of 386BSD, NetBSD, and
FreeBSD, up through the point of unencumbering, could be made as subject
to Warren's Charter definition, and subject to our archiving scope.
