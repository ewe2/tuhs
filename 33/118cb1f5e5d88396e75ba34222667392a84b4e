I wouldn't have to say anything if you did that.  I can't remember a
single time you were correct when you were talking about Sun history
when I was there.  Maybe there was such a time but by all the statements
I remember you making were way off the mark.

As the person who is making claims, the onus is on you to provide
references when you are challenged.  I don't want to argue with you and
I'm not going to.  If you want people to believe you, however, you're
gonna need to back up your claims with, as you say, verifyable statements.
