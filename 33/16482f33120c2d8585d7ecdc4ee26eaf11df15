Subject: [TUHS] Unix without pipes
Message-ID: <005901d3af25$4e9ba3f0$ebd2ebd0$@ronnatalie.com>

If I'm remembering correctly, miniunix didn't have pipes.   The shell faked
it by taking the output of the first program into a file and then  using it
as the input for the second.
Didn't really multitask anyhow, so it was pretty much fine.

Is this a SCO speciality, or are there other UNIXes like that?

Does it not even have pipe() in its libc?
