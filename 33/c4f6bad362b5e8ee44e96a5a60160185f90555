Subject: [TUHS] 32V kernel update
Message-ID: <3FA5E1B4.3000405@monmouth.com>

Uploaded new kernel archive.  Reworked Makefile.  I got it to compile 
with a stub file.  Still much work rewriting machine dependent code.

Latest is 32v-031102-01.tar.gz.  Available via anonymous ftp at 
sever.opensourcedepot.com.
