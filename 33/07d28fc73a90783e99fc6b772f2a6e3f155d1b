Larry McVoy:

  I've always morned that he died so early.  I would have liked to talk 
  to him, I love troff to this day.

Me too (s/morn/mourn/, of course).  I might even have had the
chance to work with him.

The original UNIX crowd were all really neat characters, albeit
sometimes a trifle overly characterful.  All nice guys to work
with, too, at least those who were still around when I was at
1127.
