According to Ken, the inspiration for ++ and -- came 
from the PDP-7 hardware, not from previous languages.
The PDP-7 supported only ++i, where i had to be one
of only a few memory addresses. "For symmetry", Ken
says, he put all four operations in B. (And he did
not use the hardware autoincrement.)
