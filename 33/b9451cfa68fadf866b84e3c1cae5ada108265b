Can someone here ID the mystery person?

Embarrassingly, CHM has the person misidentified as well.

There is a famous photo on Wikimedia commons, of what purports to be Ken
Thompson & Dennis Ritchie in front of a PDP-11, presumably working on
UNIX. The problem is that the seated person doesn’t look like either of
them. And he is clean-shaven. Could it be Bjarne Stroustrup? Does anyone
recall seeing T&R w/o facial hair? Any help in tracking this down would
be much appreciated! The photo has been reprinted in many places, and
I’d like to track this down before I inadvertently propagate an error.
