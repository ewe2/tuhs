It compiles and runs with no warnings or any issues with gcc 4.9.2 on
Fedora 21.

Like so many x-gener Linux guys, I was a UNIX guy in the early '90's,
and just fell into Linux.  

So, you are running BSD 2.11, on a real PDP-11 ( or is it a VAX ),  in
your house? Or are you using an emulator? Either way, that's still
probably no small feat.

I have a Mac Plus emulator ( MiniVMac ) that I installed MachTen on,
just to see if I could get it running, and it works.

( MachTen is this odd sort of UNIX that was available for the Mac in the
'90's, that runs on top of Mac OS ).

No problem.  Anyone getting the younger ones into the older technology
is good!
