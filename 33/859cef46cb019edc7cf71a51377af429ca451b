Subject: [TUHS] A man easter-egg (gimme gimme gimme)
Message-ID: <CANiMCTPZuCuCt7pbN=EDh4zfi_XnWJ7_Tqj1BLuH81OKC83c7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

An easter-egg in the version of man that is installed on the most popular
Linux distros has recently been discovered after being there for 6 years:

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/405783/why-does-man-print-gimme-gimme-gimme-at-0030

It is for example discussed here:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15747313

It makes man print 'gimme gimme gimme' if called at "Half past twelve", as
in the ABBA song.

I check on BSD, but man seems to be a shell script on FreeBSD, so it's
immune from the easter egg:
https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/master/usr.bin/man/man.sh

Do you have any UNIX easter-egg stories ? Putting some in, or discovering
one...

Was this kind of humor tolerated in the professional settings where UNIX
first circulated, or was it frowned upon ?
