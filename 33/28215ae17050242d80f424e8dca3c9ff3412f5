My reference says TPL.

It was my understanding that the 704 had this instruction too, and
that it was almost certainly the background for arithmetic IF.
Unfortunately, no reference I can find can confirm or deny this
supposition.  Another one is http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/cp0309.htm,
which compares the instruction sets, but it's not categorical enough
for my liking.  But if I interpret it correctly, CAS was implemented
on the 704.

Do you see a proof of the contrary?

In passing, my document also mentions the Honeywell 516, better known
to Unix people as IMP.  It, too, had a CAS-like instruction.
