Subject: [TUHS] My Hidden Archive (was: lost ports)
Message-ID: <20170105230853.GA11659@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, following on from the "lost ports" thread, I might remind you all that
I'm keeping a hidden archive of Unix material which cannot be made public
due to copyright and other reasons. The goal is to ensure that these bits
don't > /dev/null, even if we can't (yet) do anything with them.

If you have anything that could be added to the archive, please let me know.

My rules are: I don't divulge what's in the archive, nor who I got stuff
from. There have been very few exceptions. I have sent copies of the archive
to two important historical computer organisations who must abide by the
same rules. I think I've had one or two individuals who were desperate to
get software to run on their old kit, and I've "loaned" some bits to them.

Anway, that's it. If that seems reasonable to you, and you want an off-site
backup of your bits, I'm happy to look after them for you.

Cheers, Warren
