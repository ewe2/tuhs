I have a bunch of 32bit Sun stuff that I have been wanted to get rid of
for some time.  It is free to anyone who pays to have it shipped to
them, or if you are close enough to my location, hand delivered.

I know I have two Sun 3/50 systems, one of them has a third party memory
expansion board.  Both booted NetBSD but probably not for something like
10+ years.  I have hard drives, enclosures and cables for nearly all of
it.

The entire collection is crudely displayed at:

I can provide detailed descriptions of anything you see.  Items 7A and
7B are the Sun 3/50 systems.  Contact me off list if there is any
interest.
