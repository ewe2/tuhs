Hello from Gregg C Levine
Actually, no your not. I do. Even though my contacts with computer
technology was rather limited, until about thirty odd years ago, and
on and off, during the eighties. For example, a shop that my father
ran, which did typesetting, used a pair of teletypes to communicate
with the host. (Host wasn't a DEC system, he was a related unit.)

And surprisingly enough, one of their customers was AT&T, they sent
over a manuscript they were having problems setting using the exact
same methods being discussed here. 

My copy of the C manual, that all of us know who wrote, says it was
done that way as well.
