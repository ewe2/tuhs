Subject: [TUHS] Pipes as temp. files
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.21.1802231202410.20297@aneurin.horsfall.org>

Just curious; am I the only who, back in the early days of V6, used pipes 
as temporary files?  I mean that after calling pipe(), instead of then 
forking and playing "file-descriptor footsie" you just read and wrote 
within the same process.

I seem to recall that it worked, as long as you avoided the 8-block limit 
(or whatever it was then); I have no idea why I tried it, other than to 
see if it worked i.e. avoid the creat() (without the "e") etc.
