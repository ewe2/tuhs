Sure - but usually these are way more bad than good.  Usually way too
much urban legend, so I'm thrilled to see the 11 kept alive.

As I said, the authors seem to have done a little homework, although I was
under the impression ??Ken?? had created them for B independently (which,
of course, was first on the PDP-7).  The ++/-- for increment and decrement
was just a nice notation since they are such a common occurrence in real
code, it's handy to have. But, I did not think the PDP-7 ISA includes
addressing modes in the same manner as the 11.  I'm probably confused, but
I thought PDP-7  is a very simple instruction (and small) with an AC,
Link/Indirection and a PC - it reminded me of the PDP-8 more than anything
else [although, IIRC it could do both 1's complement and 2's - depending
the type of AND instruction].
