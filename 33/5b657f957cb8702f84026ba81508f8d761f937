Subject: [TUHS] UNIX/32v & speak....
Message-ID: <46b366130910261029g52e47beavf1011a123d5839c4@mail.gmail.com>

I was going to upload the various man pages of 32/V so I'd have a 'nice'
collection of them, and to help with my eventual conversion of the help text
into RTF for a windows helpfile when I was reading through the number
command...

So it seems that VAX's could do audio at some point?  Does anyone know how
it worked?  Naturally the speak command seems to be missing, but it does
seem very interesting...!

I wonder if this was the start of the UNIX/IVR relationship....?

Thanks!

Jason
