sure   I helped to write the original version in Vax serial #1 in bliss with Dan Klien. it's predesessor was ISPL and written for the PDP 10 the Unix rewrite in C (and lisp) was The late Ted Kowalski's PhD 

the system lives today as VHDL 

I'll see if I can dig up a copy in my archives and give it to Warren or bit savers

I have been  unable  to find any reference to It on the Internet . Do someone on this list  know anything offerte this software ?
