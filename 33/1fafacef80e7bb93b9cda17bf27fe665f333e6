A descendent of the original code is still present in DragonFlyBSD:

http://gitweb.dragonflybsd.org/dragonfly.git/tree/HEAD:/sys/vfs/portal
http://gitweb.dragonflybsd.org/dragonfly.git/tree/HEAD:/sbin/mount_portal

The facility still exists in NetBSD but it has been reimplemented on top
of puffs, the Pass-to-Userspace Framework File System development
interface.

http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?mount_portal

It survived in FreeBSD for a long time, but eventually was removed in 2012
rather than being made multiprocessor-safe.

https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/commit/efcca33ac515c354e18135425794400ea32406a8

It also got removed from OpenBSD in 2011.

Trafalgar: Northerly or northeasterly 4 or 5, increasing 6 or 7 later, perhaps
gale 8 in northeast. Moderate or rough, but slight or moderate in southeast.
Fair. Good.
