Between the 6e shell and the Bourne shell there was the Mashey, or PWB,
shell, which was the first to have them built in.  So if they existed,
they were probably separate commands on 6e-ish systems that didn't reach
the outside world.  It's important to remember that the whole terminology
of editions and releases didn't apply within Bell Labs itself.
