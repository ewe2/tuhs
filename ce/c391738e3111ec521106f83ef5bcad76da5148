Subject: [TUHS] Are the O'Reilly X books worth hanging onto?
Message-ID: <201505110819.t4B8JWc0013238@skeeve.com>

Hello All.

I have a full set of the O'Reilly X reference manuals - Volumes 1-5, 6a
and 6b. Also "The X Window System In A Nutshell". These are all from
like the mid-1990s.

Are they worth hanging onto?

If not, does anyone on this list want them?  If so, I'll send them for
the cost of postage from Israel.

Thanks,

Arnold
