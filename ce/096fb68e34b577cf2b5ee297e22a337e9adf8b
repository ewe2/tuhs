Portapunch?  Arrgghh!

We had to put up with that Satan-spawn in our University days...  Only 40 
columns wide, it had specific encodings for FORTRAN words, and it was just 
as well that FORTRAN ignored white space (I know this for a fact, when I 
fed a deck into a "real" card reader one time).

Being but mere impecunious Uni students and having to actually buy the 
things, we resorted to fixing mis-punches by literally sticky-taping the 
chads back.

For some reason, the computer operators (IBM 360/50) hated us...

I really do hope that the inventor of Portapunch is still having holes 
punched through him with a paper-clip.
