Subject: [TUHS] Photos of PDP-11s running Unix
Message-ID: <20110825232429.GA13720@minnie.tuhs.org>

Hi all,
	As part of my IEEE Spectrum article on 40 years since 1st Edition
Unix, I've been asked for some suitable imagery/photos. Has anybody brought
1st Edition up on a real PDP-11/20, and if so, could they take some photos
of the system?

I think they would even be happy with photos of PDP-11s running V6 or V7.

Anything that you can supply would be great - there is not a lot of
photos from the early days of Unix.

Thanks in advance,
	Warren
