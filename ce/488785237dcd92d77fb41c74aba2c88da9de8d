Sorry, where's this archive? Somewhere in:

  https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/

I assume? From the description, that might be from the 'Shoppa disks'; didn't
realize that was a /23 on those.

V6, as distributed, had no networking at all. There are two V6 systems with
networking in TUHS:

  https://minnie.tuhs.org//cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=SRI-NOSC
  https://minnie.tuhs.org//cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=BBN-V6

The first is an 'NCP' Unix (unless unless you have an ARPANet); the second is
a fairly early TCP/IP from BBN (ditto, out of the box; although one could write
an Ethernet driver for it).

There's also a fairly nice Internet-capable V6 (well, PWB1, actually) from MIT
which I keep meaning to upload; it includes SMTP, FTP, etc, etc. I also have
visions of porting an ARP I wrote to it, and bringing up an Ethernet driver
for the DEQNA/DELQA, but I've yet to get to any of that.


    > it's hard to glean that wisdom from reading the manual.

Yeah, DEC manuals went through a phase-change around about the time of the
/23.  Old DEC manuals are wonderful; stuffed to the gills with deep technical
details. Suitable for engineers...

Later, they turned into manuals for 'ordinary people' - 'plug cable C1 into
plug P1'. Semi-useless; although one can often glean a few useful morsels if
you trawl through the entire thing.

That's why I've been doing PDP-11 pages on the CHWiki which attempt to cover a
lot of technical detail, in a high technical content/size way.

If you need something that's not there, let me know, and I'll get to adding it.
