Is the original SVR4 around somewhere (even if still considered trade 
secret or copyrighted?)

I'm getting ready to have my collection of 9 track magtapes recovered, 
(Sydex sounds very reasonable) and I find I have 5 AT&T SVR4 tapes among 
them (all different, I think, but I won't know until I read them.)  They 
are labeled Proprietary and Copyright, and I claim no special rights to 
them other than as an ex AT&T employee.

Is it worth recovering them?
