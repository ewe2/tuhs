Clearly this will depend on how ps is implemented, which is one of the
messier aspects of our favorite OS.  If it does its thing just by
reading a pseudo-file or a pseudo-device, then setgid will be enough,
but maybe it needs to execute a root-only system call.

There is a longish thread on comp.unix.programmer right now about this
very topic.
