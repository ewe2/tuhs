Certainly the [AK]SR-33 didn't have {}~.  I had this funny feeling
that they did have |, but it doesn't make sense, and I'm probably
wrong.

A thing to recall is that the shape of some of the symbols was
somewhat different in those days.  In particular, _ was a backarrow
(pointing left), and ^ was an uparrow, making it look much more like |
than it appears nowadays.
