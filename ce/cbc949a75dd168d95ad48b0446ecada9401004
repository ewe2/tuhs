I believe that Mary Ann is referring to repeatedly looking up (presumably
different) elements in the entry.  Assuming that e.g. `vi` looks up O(n)
elements, where $n$ is the number of elements, doing a linear scan for
each, you'd end up with quadratic behavior.

Hashing, or storing in some kind of balanced-tree like structure or
something, would of course help but would also necessitate doing a copy and
would entail some additional memory inefficiency.
