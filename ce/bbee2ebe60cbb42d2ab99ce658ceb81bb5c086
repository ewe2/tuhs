I would argue the first.  In the case of current linux cat, I would make a
separate utility to number lines, a separate utility to squeeze out repeated
empty blank lines, a separate utility to show non printing characters that
might have an option to select the characters that would encompass -T.  All of
these are useful utilities by themselves.  Someone using a particular combo of
options a lot can always write their own scripts or use aliases.  That's the
beauty of composability.
