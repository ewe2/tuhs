Excellent stuff Tim. I've had a quick look; I suspect the existing code:

        cmp     r5,u.count /
        bgt     1f / branch if r5 greater than u.count
        mov     r5,u.count

checks to ensure that the new a.out is small emough to fit into the
address space left by the executable that called exec(2).

That's also a good idea.  Thanks Tim.
