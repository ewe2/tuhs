Subject: [TUHS] Happy birthday, John Lions!

Dr. Prof. John Lions was born on this day in 1937; I had the pleasure of 
having him as one of my Computer Science lecturers in the early 70s, and 
he drilled into us the Principle of Least Astonishment (or POLA), better 
known as "why the fsck did it do that?" (but he was far too genteel to 
express it that way).  And yes, that's my name in the credits; I helped 
with the proof-reading and provided the use of the high-quality printer in 
the CSU.

You are not expected to understand this.
