Here's a few extras so far:
An excel spreadsheet used to verify the contents while restoring the 
table, and the un-fixed NUL-padded speak.c file as present on disk. The 
missing sector is filled with NULs.
The votrax sc-01 datasheet i used to fill in the excel sheet can be 
found at http://www.redcedar.com/sc01/sc01.pdf

I'm working on restoring speak.v right now, and am also looking at that 
new image Al Kossow sent.
Doug Mcilroy sent me a copy of speak.v from a later non-votrax 
(apl-based?) synthesizer and the words/rules seem to be in the same 
order as in the original votrax version. I don't know if I can 
distribute it.

One thing I didn't mention if you're diving into the disk image with a 
hex editor: for some reason, I'm not exactly sure why, the file is 
stored spread all over the place but (almost?) always generally in 
reverse sector order. So if each letter represents a sector and A is the 
first sector (and x are sectors you're not interested in) the file would 
be arranged:
...HxxxxGxFxxxxExxDxxxCBxxxxxA
