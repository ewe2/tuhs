This was a off list discussion with The High Priest of the Daemon, Mr.
Kirk McKusick himself. He possibly still has the original 4.4BSD SPARC
and PMAX distribution tapes. He is willing to give them to me to read
them for transfering the contens into the TUHS archive. Unfortunately my
9 track tape does only 1600 / 3200 BPI and I assume the tapes are 6250
BPI... Also if someone in the USA can do the job it would reduce
shipping cost and efforts for Mr. McKusick, because I am beyond the "big
pond".

In the archive is only 4.4BSD-ALPHA with hp300 binarys, so... [beging
