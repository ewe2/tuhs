not to forget Sun&nbsp;UNIX&nbsp;0.7 (Sun-1) From: jnc at mercury.lcs.mit.edu (Noel Chiappa)Sent: Thu, 20 Apr 2017 18:04:53To: tuhs at tuhs.orgCc: jnc at mercury.lcs.mit.eduSubject: Re: [TUHS] Zilog Z80 Unix&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; From: &quot;Erik E. Fair&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; I have a memory of having seen a Zilog Z-80 .... based Unix, possibly v6&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; ... I recall asking the people in the booth how they managed without an&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; MMU, and don&#39;t recall their answer. I do remember thinking that since&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; Unix had &quot;grown up&quot; with MMUs to stomp on obvious pointer mistakes, the&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; software ought to be relatively well-behavedI don&#39;t know about the Z80 part, but for the MMU aspect, recall that the firstcouple of versions of PDP-11 Unix ran on a model (the -11/20) which didn&#39;thave an MMU (although, as mentioned before here, it apparently did later use athing called a KS11, the specifications for which seem to be mostly lost).A
 lthough recall the mention of calling out &quot;a.out!&quot;, as to the hazards ofdoing so...And of course there was the &#39;Unix for an LSI-11&#39; (LSX), although I gather thatwas somewhat lobotomized, as the OS and application has to fit into 56KBtotal.So it was possible to &#39;sorta kind-of&#39; do Unix without an MMU.&nbsp; Noel
