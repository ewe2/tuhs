I've used an ASR33 with an PDP-8-E, an ASR33 with an opto coupler
to some tymeshare services and an ASR35 as a console to an PDP-8-I
but theses where all ASCII.  According to wikipedia "A companion
Model 32 used the more established five-level Baudot code."

More teletype history at <http://www.pdp8online.com/asr33/asr33.shtml>

And have a look at the picture of Ken & ennis with two 33's
<http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/picture.html> and comments
from dmr. Note te ASCII keyboard.
