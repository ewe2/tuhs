=E2=80=9CA pain to run=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Ctense=E2=80=9D indeed!  The =
Dover printing system was an Alto (6 MIPs <microinstructions>) driving =
=E2=80=9COrbit=E2=80=9D hardware about half the size of the Alto =
itself*, driving the raster video to the printer.  The hardware was =
called =E2=80=9Corbit=E2=80=9D because it could directly =E2=80=9COR=E2=80=
=9D bits into the raster image, rather than requiring read-modify-write =
cycles.  =E2=80=9CSpruce=E2=80=9D was the spooler and printer driver =
that ran on the Alto.  Evidently the hardware is a typical Butler =
Lampson knife edge design up in the corner of what was possible, =
implemented by Bob Sproull and Severo Ornstein.  Additional software by =
Dan  Swinehart.

There=E2=80=99s a page about this in =
https://bwlampson.site/38-AltoSoftware/Abstract.html =
<https://bwlampson.site/38-AltoSoftware/Abstract.html> and a patent =
https://patents.google.com/patent/US4203154 =
<https://patents.google.com/patent/US4203154>.  I have a feeling I=E2=80=99=
ve seen a longer description of Orbit somewhere but I can=E2=80=99t =
remember where.

Like most Stanford folks of the era I printed my thesis on one, assisted =
about 1 AM by Lyle Ramshaw who knew where to get a new drum for the =
printer.

In any event, a vast improvement over the XGP and a godsend for those of =
us who <didn=E2=80=99t> have a phototypesetter.

* An earlier one-off called EARS had printer hardware about 3 times the =
size of the attached Alto.  That one was font-image based.  To do things =
like lines and  graphics the software constructed custom font glyphs to =
make up the image.
