I mentioned some of this list's discussions about overlays and threaded
code in the pub last night, and my friend Rich Wareham said that he had
implemented a B compiler as a fun project, using Python and LLVM.

I thought it might be of interest, so here's a link:
https://github.com/rjw57/rbc

The doc/pdf subdirectory includes copies of the reference documents Rich
used as a specification for B.
