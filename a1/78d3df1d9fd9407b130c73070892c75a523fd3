+1

All else being equal, I would prefer the old list retain the old behaviour 
(i.e., to add the "[TUHS]" string to the Subject line) if possible.

But if there's a strong reason to prefer to change the behaviour of the 
old list (which, based on the Subject lines, still seems to have the 
majority of users), that's fine to.

I really appreciate all the contributions from everyone who participates 
on this list, and especially Warren for his onoing work to maintain the 
list and the related resources.

So thanks!

Cheers.
