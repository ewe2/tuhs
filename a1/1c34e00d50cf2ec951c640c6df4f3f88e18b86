Subject: [TUHS] Pre-v6 images and 2.11BSD patches
Message-ID: <20151212045416.GB5686@server.rulingia.com>

Some time ago, someone posted an early Unix image that I recall
running.  I know it was pre-groups but don't recall anything else and
I can't find either the images or mailing list references either
locally or on tuhs.org.  Does anyone recall the details.

Also, I've seen suggestions that there's a 2.11BSD patch later than
447 but I can't find anything "official" and www.2bsd.com is either
down or inaccessible from all the systems I have access to.  Does
anyone know if 448 or later were released?  And given the issues with
www.2bsd.com would someone be willing to mirror it (assuming we can
got a copy of it)?
