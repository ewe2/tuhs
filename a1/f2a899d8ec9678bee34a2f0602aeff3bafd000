Thanks; fascinating!

Do the Net-2-derived BSDs (including Darwin) really count as Unix-derived?
I thought they were fairly free of AT&T code now, other than headers and
the like.  Conceptually, of course, they are Unix-derived, but then so
is Linux.

It would be snazzy to restore the classical typography of Unix as
U<small>NIX</small> in your paper.
