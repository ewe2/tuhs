If memory serves, Ralph Griswold once told me that the four versions of =
SNOBOL, culminating with SNOBOL4, took, respectively, a day, a week, a =
month, and year to implement.

Related to SNOBOL, something I=E2=80=99ve wondered about for years is =
whether I may have been the only regular user of RATSNO, which Dave =
Hanson created as a test of RATFOR=E2=80=99s retargetability.  I =
stumbled across RATSNO on the Icon V2 tape, and used it for quite a bit =
of my undergraduate programming at NC State in 1980-81.

Phil Budne: Thanks for your CSNOBOL4 implementation!  I=E2=80=99ve used =
it to show students SNOBOL4 in a comparative languages class at the U of =
Arizona.  (I was thinking your name sounded familiar!)
