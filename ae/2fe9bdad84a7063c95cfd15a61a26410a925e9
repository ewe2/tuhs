GCC is parameterized for a lot more variability than actually exists
nowadays.  As for Emacs, it's traditional to call it bloated because of
all the Elisp code it ships with, but (as esr says in the paper I cited)
that's like calling the shell bloated because there are a lot of shell
scripts out there.  It's a category mistake.

That's basically just the kind of peeving that objects to the use of
computers as calculators and spelling checkers.  "What will Kids Today do
when a calculator isn't available?"  Well, what will they do when there
isn't any ink to dip their goose quills in?  If you're not an angel,
there is no real advantage to learning to dance on the head of a pin.
