That's not an official patch.  It's a collection of improvements by
Johnny Billquist.  I'm running with a couple of them on my 2.11BSD
installations, but disagree with a couple of the others (I don't want
the automatic boot, and I do console byte length and parity slightly
differently) -- and I have a few mods of my own as well, of course.

It's great that Johnny published his changes, but they should really be
stored as six suggested improvements, and not in a way that makes them
look as if they're yet another patch kit from Steven.
