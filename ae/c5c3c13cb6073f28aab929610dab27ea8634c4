Subject: [pups] Making a TK50 2.11BSD boot tape for an 11/73
Message-ID: <20030115154831.A9065@bcr10.uwaterloo.ca>

  Howdy.

  I'd like to confirm that somebody has successfully made a TK50 boot tape
for 2.11BSD using a TK50Z attached to some other Unix box.  In my case it will
likely have to be Linux, though IRIX might be doable.  It *should* work, after
all, but, well, you know.  :)
