Hello (again) from Gregg C Levine
Funny you should be bringing that into the subject, Greg! Every time I
booted an image from the repository here, at TUHS, or directly from
the home SIMH site, I didn't bother to check those features. I just
managed to login, and do what prompted me to do that. The next time I
do so, which should be this week, I'll certainly look for it.

And I thought this would be a short thread.
