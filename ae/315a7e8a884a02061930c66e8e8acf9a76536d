Sorry for the delay Kirk. It could be that the V7 bootstrap expects
split I/D, or a different I/O mapping then what's provided on the /34.

I'll punt this to the PUPS mailing list. I have a suspicion that
you won't be able to install V7, but you should be able to install V6
or 2.9BSD instead.

Cheers,

I once had Ultrix-11 3.1 running on a dual RK05 11/34. What I'd call a
very minimal system ;-) But it ran

Hi -

> From: Wilko Bulte <wilko at yedi.iaf.nl>

	I will be doing some more research on this when I get home from
	work tonight.

> very minimal system ;-) But it ran

	That is because DEC put the extra effort into supporting non-split I/D
	machines.  The "stock" V7 really wanted a 11/70.  In fact there was a
	chapter in the back of one of the manuals/books detailing what it took
	to get V7 running on an 11/40 (it was a non-trivial project).

	Several things conspire against V7 and later on 11/34 (or 35, 40, 60,
	etc).  The two most notable ones are the limited address space,  
	everything (drivers, data structures, general kernel code) must fit 
	in 56kb instead of 120kb - (8kb reserved for the I/O page) and lack 
	of instruction restart on MMU faults.

	I'll take a look at the V7 layout later but my memory is that it
	wanted an 11/70.

I'm 99% sure, that it's V7 which I have running (for lower values
of running, because one drive is dead and the power supply needs
to be replaced) on my 11/34A with 128kB RAM and two RL01. I think
I wanted to install V6, but installed V7 because of the RL01 drivers.
I stripped V7 down, so I only needed one RL01 disk pack (I have only
two.) and transfered the disk image via kermit.

I want to install 2.11BSD on my M70 with 512kB RAM (No, more RAM is
to expensive here. 1MB for over US$500.) and a 120MB ST506-type disk,
but had not much time. I want to avoid the way of the disk image,
because I have no BSD installed for the emulator and don't know,
if the transfere of slices of the disk image would be successfull.
(The RT-11 only handles 32MB "disks".) I think the best way would
be to boot from a 2.11BSD floppy and install it via serial port.
(TU-58 emu? Are there 1.2MB 2.11BSD floppies somewhere?)
