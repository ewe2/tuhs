Subject: [TUHS] question about V7 ls(1) vs. sys/stat.h and ls.c
Message-ID: <200305251622.h4PGMdp0003047@beastie.mckusick.com>

The st_blocks field was first added to the stat structure in 4.2BSD
(4.1b really) as part of the overhaul to add the new filesystem. I
added it because the variable filesystem blocksize made it difficult
to compute the amount of storage dedicated to a file.
