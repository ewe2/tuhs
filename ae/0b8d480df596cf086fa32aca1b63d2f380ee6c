Subject: [TUHS] Enhanced troff available
Message-ID: <43296b30.UeKZoLxd0OuPcmR1%gunnarr@acm.org>

Hi,

perhaps some people on this list are interested to hear that I have
updated troff (from OpenSolaris code) to support:

- direct access to PostScript Type 1 and Type 42 (converted TrueType)
  fonts
- small capitals, old-style numerals, and ligatures from PostScript
  "expert" fonts
- pairwise kerning of characters and letter space tracking, including
  a request to create kerning pairs for characters from different fonts
- hanging characters
- arbitrary letter sizes, including fractional points
- text input according to the locale, including UTF-8 input on most
  platforms
- hyphenation of international languages
- international paper sizes such as A4
- DSC-conforming PostScript output
- PDF bookmarks
- higher device resolutions.

Source code is available at <http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/doctools.html>.

	Gunnar
