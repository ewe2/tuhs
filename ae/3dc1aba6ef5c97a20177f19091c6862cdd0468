I just did a small amount of hunting.  The oldest printed USENIX Proceeding
seems to be 1983 [which was the one Rob gave 'cat -v considered harmful' -
although only the abstract is in it].

George did the ordered writes work earlier as I was still at Tektronix,
because I remember getting a tape from him a putting the changes into our
V7 system.

If we hunt around for a 'Purdue-EE' distribution circa '79-'81 we should be
able to find it.  BTW: as a piece of History for Diomidis on that same tape
is fix for one of the first '0-day' UNIX exploits I can remember.  I'll see
if I can find it and identify it for you.   That would be a good piece of
history to call out.

The story is this ...

George was very upset when he found it.  But this was during the time when
UNIX was fighting a bit for it's life in the press as not being a 'real'
OS.   DEC and IBM making claims that it was a toy, *etc*.   So most of the
the hacker community took it pretty seriously.   It is funny, today we
would react in the opposite manner.,  But, there was a big 'hush-hush'
meeting at a Summer USENIX that was very exclusive to be invited too.    We
were in a private conference room, the door was locked etc.   I remember
that Dennis was there, Joy was there. Ron's old friend Mike must have been
in it.  I think a couple of the Rand folks.   Anyway - it was an issue with
profile(2) -- surprise, surprise.   Pretty easy fix.   We all took the code
back and promised to get patches out ASAP and not tell any one about it.
