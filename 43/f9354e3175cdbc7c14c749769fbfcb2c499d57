Wait, are you arguing for STREAMS over sockets?  Dear god, please no.
Have you ever used STREAMS (not Ritchies streams, those were OK)?
I have.  I ported Lachman's STREAMS based TCP/IP stack twice, once
to a long since defunct super computer called the ETA-10 and then 
to SCO Unix.  I've got way more STREAMS experience than most people
and I can tell you that sockets are WAY WAY better.  I get the "it
should have just been file I/O" except that I don't.  I tried to 
write a library that let you open up /net/tcp/$host:$port and do
I/O like it was a file descriptor.  That works for a lot of stuff
but I ran into problems quickly.  A networking connection is not
a file handle.  You can make some stuff work but I couldn't figure
out how to do all of it.   You end up having to do ioctls to handle
the stuff that doesn't fit well into the file system name space.
I think plan 9 did this sort of thing, maybe Rob can prove me wrong
or remember where it didn't match.

I do know that STREAMS came back to Solaris, some VP inked a shitty
deal with Lachman and bought the rights to the stack.  It was slow
as molasses in the winter and customers absolutely hated it.  Sun 
got Mentat to redo it for perf but customers still hated it, they
understood sockets, everyone else had sockets, they wanted sockets
and they got them.  Sun put them back and nobody ever asked about
STREAMS again.
