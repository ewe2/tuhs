Don't know if this is of interest to anybody out there, but I was
just looking for something else in the basement and came across
two notebooks that look like a UNIX System Internals course.  Appears
to cover version 6, version 7, PWB, 32V, System III, and System V.
Has the Western Electric seal of disapproval on the front.
