For externals, it's a limitation of the PDP-11 a.out format. Other
systems may or may not have had the same limit or a different limit.

For VAX, 4BSD appears to use an "index into file string table", whereas
3BSD still has an 8-character string. I don't see any provision in the
4BSD linker for loading 3BSD binaries.

Filenames over 14 characters appear to have been introduced in 4.1BSD.
