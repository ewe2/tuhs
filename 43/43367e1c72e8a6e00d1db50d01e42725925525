That's not the problem this solves. The problem with allocating
process groups in the shell (and making them equal to the process id
of the pgrp leader) is that you end up with a race condition when
trying to add subsequent processes in a pipeline to that pgrp.
It forces you to artifically prevent the process group leader from
running or exiting until you're finished setting up the entire
pipeline.

The shell has to set the terminal process group to arbitrary process
groups, not just its own: that's how `fg' has to work. For that purpose,
tcsetpgrp is fine. You just have to make sure that you only call it
when the shell is in the foreground.

As for other processes, I'm not sure exactly what you mean by `control
operation', but you surely would want a background process to get stopped
if it tries to set the terminal attributes.

This is something that would be nice to have, but there are security
considerations that make it tricky. Not unsolvable, but tricky to get
right.
