Does anyone know of the existence of source code written in B (C's predecessor?)

I have encountered a few snippets here and there, but nothing
substantial.  The only "real" program that I know of is AberMUD-1.  It
looks like there exists a physical print-out of it:

Could it be that this is the only artifact left of this most important
"missing link" of C and Unix History?  How can this (and any other B
source) be gathered and preserved?
