We lost Claude Shannon on this day in 2001.  He was a mathematician, 
electrical engineer, and cryptographer; he is regarded as the "father" of 
information theory, and he pioneered digital circuit design.  Amongst 
other things he built a barbed-wire telegraph, the "Ultimate Machine" (it 
reached up and switched itself off), a Roman numeral computer ("THROBAC"), 
the Minivac 601 (a digital trainer), a Rubik's Cube solver, a mechanical 
mouse that learned how to solve mazes, and outlined a chess program 
(pre-Belle).  He formulated the security mantra "The enemy knows the 
system", and did top-secret work in WW-2 on crypto and fire-control 
systems.
