Thanks. I'm thinking we could classify the Unix clones under three categories:
the commercial, such as UniFlex, Idris, UNOS
the academic, such as Minix and Tunix
and the hobbyist such as Linux at its beginning

Then it strikes me that that could probably apply to Unix at various stages in
its history:
v1, v2, v3 hobbyist v4?
v5, v6, *BSD academic
SysIII, SysV commercial
