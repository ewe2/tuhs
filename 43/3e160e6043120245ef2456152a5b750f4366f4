remove procfs ctl interface

This interface has no in-tree consumers and has been more or less
non-functional for several releases.

Remove manpage note that the procfs special file 'mem' is grouped to
kmem. This hasn't been true since r81107.

Remove procfs' README file. It is an out of date duplication of the manpage
(quoth the README: "since the bsd kernel is single-processor...").

There are just a few potential users of /proc and they were already
using other facilities. plus /proc is an optional facility. All this
conspired to make /proc less useful in FreeBSD. Unused code is in
danger of being garbage collected in FreeBSD :-)
