I have this on the origin of Montgomery and Zimmerman Emacs:

  "[Montgomery's] emacs implementation was begun in 1979, after having
  left MIT.  I made it freely available to people INSIDE of Bell Labs,
  and it was widely used. It was never officially "released" from Bell
  Labs."

  "Unfortunately, several copies did get out during that time, mainly
  due to people who left Bell Labs to return to school or gave copies to
  friends.  When Zimmerman modified one of those copies as the original
  basis for CCA emacs, AT&T and CCA had a prolonged debate over it.
  Eventually the matter was resolved when Zimmerman replaced the last of
  my code"
