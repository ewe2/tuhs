Yes, TeX is supposed to be pronounced as Germans do Bach. And
Knuth further recommends that the name be typeset as a logo with
one letter off the base line. Damned if an awful lot of people,
especially LaTeX users, don't follow his advice. I've known
and admired Knuth for over 50 years, but part ways with him
on this. If you use the ready-made LaTeX logo in running text,
so should you also use flourished cursive for Coca-Cola and
Ford; and back in the day, discordantly slanted letters for
Holiday Inn. It's mad and it's a pox on the page.
