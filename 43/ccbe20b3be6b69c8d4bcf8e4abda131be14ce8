So having just finished a book project and therefore having a bit of a clue
as to what it would take, I'd be willing to take a stab at coordinating a
project like this.  But it's not clear to me what the audience should be.
Many of the folks on this list are obsessive with details that matter to,
well, only people on this list.  To make a good book I think that it would
have to trace the major paths, innovations, and people.  In any case, this
would be easy - just write whatever you want and wait for Clem to correct
you and fill in the details :-)
