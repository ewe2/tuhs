Subject: [Unix-jun72] organization of fs tree
Message-ID: <Pine.BSI.4.64.0805111143570.20114@malasada.lava.net>

The new boot stuff that James provided has more fs/usr files.  How
do we want to organize this in the tree?  Do we just mix it with the
fs2 bits?  Do we enter it as part of the new bits?
