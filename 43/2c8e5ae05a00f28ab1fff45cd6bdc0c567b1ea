Hello!
Well before it was withdrawn from marketing, it played in a big pool
Namely the mainframes at one of the universities in Norway. And I got
this from a VMer I who is best known for writing the pipelines stuff,
And sadly that was its only customer.

By contrast AIX for RS/6000 gang and its ancestors were well taken
care of and its still available.
