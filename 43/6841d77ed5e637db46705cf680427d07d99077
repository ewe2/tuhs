I would not care. I would want to get everything, because one day my
interests could change (I might want to know what people said about
editors, for example :-) ) and who knows, maybe a list would be gone
already. I even archive the spam, just in case I want to do some big
data stuff on it one day. My yearly mailbox is on par with two cdroms,
so any savings would be rather minimal.

And boy, the more the better. Just think about those scripts to
process (hundred) thousands of mails. Displaying stuff on text
terminal. Green text terminal emulator. Better than norp, if you ask
me. Actually, this is norp.
