That's already been done: Look at 2.11BSD.

Note that getting V7 (or 2BSD) running on a 286 is non-trivial.
Whilst both the PDP-11 and 286 are both 16-bit machines supporting VM,
the 286 MMU is extremely primitive compared to the PDP-11.  Your
biggest problem will be that the 286 does not support holes in the
address space - which means your data segment needs to cover both the
real data as well as the stack area and you lose brk limit checking.
