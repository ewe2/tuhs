these were in by the time I can along but I was wondering when they got it.

They've also always felt a bit like a thing that did not fit to me. I'm
pretty sure I was not alone, given that the Unix authors worked out a way
to get rid of them in later efforts. I know what came after, in Plan 9;
what came before, in Unix, that led to special files?
