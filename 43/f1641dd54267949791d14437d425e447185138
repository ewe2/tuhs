I think we have all been there.  Something always goes wrong.  I wrote 
a paper about how to restore a Masscomp because I did rm -rf . in /.
I believe we had roots home as / because /usr was a different partition.
Clem, did Masscomp make roots home / or was that us?  Anyway, I did a
cd something
and somehow deleted the something and then did rm -rf .
Much fun was had, I was up all night putting things back together.
This was probably around 1984 or 1985, I was pretty green.
