This is also a really good talk, by Benno Rice.  Benno is a FreeBSD
developer, and has served on the FreeBSD Core Team.  He gave this talk
at Linux.Conf.au 2019, and it was a repeat of a talk he gave at BSDCan
2018, entitled "The Tragedy of Systemd" ("Tragedy" in the title was
used in the Greek drama context):

It's a pretty fair talk about the why systemd came up, and what we
might be able to learn from systemd.  His closing line was, which I
think is quite good was:

   "What I would challenge every one here is to look at systemd, and
    try find one thing you like --- and then go try to implement it."
