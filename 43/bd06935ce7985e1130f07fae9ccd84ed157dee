OK, likely not, but I've used literally dozens of systems[*] over the last 
40 years or so; this one was definitely Unix-ish (otherwise I wouldn't've 
used it) and it definitely required a contiguous file for ease of DMA.

Wish I could remember it, but the ol' memory is one of the first things to 
go when in your 60s, and I never could remember what comes afterwards...

[*]
Pretty much AIX to Xenix (when you pronounce it with a "Z").
