Not sure which two do you mean, but keep in mind that the current release is
4.3BSD-Quasijarus0c, and that Warren's archive is no longer the main
distribution site for 4.3BSD-Quasijarus and is not up to date.  The main
distribution site for 4.3BSD-Quasijarus is ifctfvax.Harhan.ORG.

Use real compress, get it from

ifctfvax.Harhan.ORG:/pub/UNIX/components/compress.tar

I'm using compress -s mode, which produces the same strong compression ratio as
gzip (stronger than original compress), but without the politically unacceptable
letter 'g'.
