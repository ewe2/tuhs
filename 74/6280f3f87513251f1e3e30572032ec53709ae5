You=E2=80=99ve compressed quite a bit of history.  IBM didn=E2=80=99t engag=
e with Linux in
a serious way until Jan 2000.  It took a bit longer for things to really
become corporate, but the fall of the first dot com bubble definitely
started skewing toward Linux and away from commercial unix, windows, BSD,
whatever.  Red Hat (and many of its variants like Amazon Linux, CentOS) and
Ubuntu emerged as early winners in the corporate and cloud market.  I think
Ubuntu discredits a lot of the claims.  IBM is a major contributor to
Ubuntu.

Yes IBM shipped 4.3 BSD as AOS, Academic Operating System (the name which
is kind of funny).  There=E2=80=99s definitely BSD code in every OS they sh=
ip,
including os/400 by way of PASE (this is somewhat ironic because IBM went
to great lengths to keep unix influences out of os/400).

The case looks flimsy.  Some lawyers will make money regardless, I=E2=80=99=
d be
surprised if anyone would take something like this on without immediate
remuneration.

&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0There was a status report filed o=
n February 16, 2018, details<br>
&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0remaining claims and counterclaim=

ssigned to oversee settlement<br>
&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0discussions. But SCO Group v. IBM=
 is still open.<br>
&gt;&gt; &quot;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Either way, some one if fooling us hard.<br>

&gt;&gt; PS: OK, it seems it&#39;s for real:<br>

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I need to check my stock of pop corn, then...<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; My take: it&#39;s obvious they want to be a nuisance so that IBM s=
ettles the<br>
&gt;&gt; case, so they then can go back home with some fresh cash. I hope I=
BM goes<br>
&gt;&gt; ballistic on them to the bitter end, and finally sends the zombie =
back to<br>
&gt;&gt; its grave. But then, IBM now has its new RedHat business to protec=
t, so<br>
&gt;&gt; it<br>
&gt;&gt; can get interesting.<br>
