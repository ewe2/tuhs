I take that back. I was ssh'd into my home machine and running simh over
the link. I think the output from the 1st Edition kernel comes out in
clumps (i.e. a small internal buffer's worth), and each clump was being
shipped over the link as a single TCP packet; hence I was seeing latency
between the clumps. My apologies.
