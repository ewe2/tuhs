Johns Hopkins had no Computer Science department at the time I was a student there.   You came out with either a degree in EE or Math if you wanted to do computers.   Of course, due to circumstances, I came out of there with nearly four years of UNIX internals experience.    I also learned in the school of hard knocks about decent code design.

I’ve generally found that having a degree in computer science didn’t indicate that the applicant had any qualification.    I look for prior experience (or at least some sort of indication of a programming experience).    Within 90 days I could generally tell if people were worth retaining (reasonable skills or ability to learn at least).
