Perhaps even more significantly in this case, but possibly not
publicly known at the time, IBM's Project Chess, which resulted in the
IBM PC, apparently began in July 1980. (The promise was to develop an
initial prototype in 30 days, and a working personal computer in a
year; the initial demo was in August, the first internal demo in
January 1981, and product release was in August 1981.)

So by "mid 1980", what would eventually lead up to the IBM PC was at
most _just barely_ getting started.
