I've never heard the claim that the kernel was "defect free", as a 
fisherman that sort of feels like saying "I always get fish" which is
a sure fire way to make sure you get none on the next trip :-)

I do get "Deliberately wrote consistent, high quality code." as that is
a choice.  If you look through the code my team wrote, I think you'll
find the same.  But everyone has to be committed to that level of 
coding or it goes to shit pretty quickly.  Super pleasant when the
whole team wants the code to be like that.

I'd be willing to say that you could find a bug very quickly in our
code but to claim that it is bug free is a bridge too far for me.
