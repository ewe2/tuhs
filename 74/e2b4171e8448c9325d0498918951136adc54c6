If you had ever attached a DEC VT05 (glass teletype) to your Sixth
Edition or Seventh Edition Unix system you would understand why the
Usenix monthly magazine is named ";login:".   The user prompt contains
escape sequences to control a model 37 Teletype, but the VT05 doesn't
respond to them, and in fact ignores the <esc> character and just
displays the semicolon and colon part of the escape sequences.
