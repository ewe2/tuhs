At the time we are talking, almost all people were using serial line
protocols, of some form, for point-to-point links. Ethernet was "new"
and I think at one level, being a good (binary) tty/serial discipline
was workable. Stacking things was possible was it not? And, the way I
understand it, The code avoided data copying so was very very
efficient across protocol stacks.

I think it was capable of being improved. Sockets is now defined by
standards. Its impossible to make it do things without huge cost.
We're comparing now, with then.. always dangerous.
