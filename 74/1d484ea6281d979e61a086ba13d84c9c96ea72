I remember the TTYs quite distinctly: they were my first computer interfaces.  On the model
33 and 35 teletypes, a carriage return and a single rubout were sufficient padding, even if
the carriage was on the far right.  The rubout character was distinctive, and you could spot
line separators fairly easily on the punched paper tape.  (Where did all my paper tapes go?)

My favorite line in the Model 33 TTY repair manual:
“The resistor will act as a fuse.”
