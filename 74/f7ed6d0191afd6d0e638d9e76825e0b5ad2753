"Expect some more releases soon" and the last release was 0.0.whatever, in
2007.  I think that speaks volumes as to how popular PL/I is today.  That
being said, the Linux compiler does appear to be actively developed, and I
suppose I shouldn't be surprised that the two platforms for active
development are Linux and OS/2 (!).

I have a vague recollection of installing and playing with a PL/I compiler
demo for Ultrix, but I figured that the language was essentially dead at
that point.  I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised that there are still
people using it, as this is the world of "we wrote the specifications in
1975 and there's no reason to update them," but I have a hard time
imagining those companies being truly competitive, and an even harder time
imagining them attracting talent under retirement age.
