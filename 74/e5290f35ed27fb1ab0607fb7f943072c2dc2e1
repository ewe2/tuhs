The whole userland is zerod before the a.out is loaded.  I did find
a bug -- I was setting u.break to text+data+bss when it should have
been core+text+data+bss - any dynamic allocation was probably giving
back incorrect pointers.

I committed the fix but I don't have a good way to test it.  I can't
seem to enter a "}" character (or upper case lettes) into the console
so I cant easily type a test C program.  Anyone know of a setting to
work around this or to translate ^M into ^J?

Anyway, if you have more problems, please send me a test program and
I'll try to debug it further.
