Jeremy,

I  have described much of this in previous messages.   So to recap....

The first licensee was Columbia University (Lou Katz), 4th Edition and I
>>believe<< Harvard was second, but it might have been someone else in
NYC.   I was always under the impression that Rand Corp was the first
commercial license, when a couple of Harvard Students wanted to bring it
west.   CMU, MIT, UofI were all about 1-3 years later.  I believe MIT and
CMU started with 5th edition and UofI 6th.  Chesson is no longer with us to
verify, but I think Steve Holmgren was in on that, and I believe I have
seem him on a couple of other mailing lists.  CMU was definitely 5th
edition to start, and quickly went to 6th.   MIT had it early also since,
like CMU, they had interns and OYOC students from the Labs, so code went
freely both ways in those days.

The redistribution license is a little more hazy. It was either Peter
Weiner at ISC or the folks at Wollongong.  I had always been under the
belief it was Peter, but Werner has some data that shows Wollongong was
either at the same time or shortly thereafter.   These were custom licenses
for V6 and its not clear about certain details and Werner seems to think
not exactly the same (*i.e.* Wollongong negotiated some special terms no
one else had).  Al Arms (AT&T legal) is likely to be the only person that
really knows for sure, as he was the common thread on all it in the early
days.

With Seventh Edition, Al wrote the first general commercial redistribution
license with sliding fees etc.   If you wanted a 7th edition license, any
previous licenses we voided.  There was great moaning about the fees.
 After about 6 months, Prof Dennis Allison of Stanford (who was consulting
for just about all of us in those days), brokered a meeting at Ricki's
Hyatt in Palo Alto, I want to say winter 1980.   This was the beginning of
the more global negotiation with what would become the System III license
(all flavors).  Again this license superseded all previous ones.

And thus the #1 president for the later OSF creation came into being, so
called: '*Stable Licensing Terms*.'  When the System V license was
released, AT&T changed things again.   By the time of SVR3 the
commercial folks had had enough and a war ensued.
