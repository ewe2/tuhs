Ah yes, the machine with only 8 instructions (of course not counting all the
multiplexing of OPR).
I was always fond of TAD.    Not particularly reentrant version of
subroutine linkage.

OT, but of interest to a few people here :-)

The venerable PDP-8 was introduced in 1965 today (or tomorrow if you're on
the wrong side of the date line).  It was the first computer I ever used,
back around 1970 (I think I'd just left school and was checking out the
local University's computer department, with a view to majoring in Computer
Science (which I did)).
