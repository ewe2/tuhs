​Or in there case, negative value.   RH likes to have the world believe
they are Linux.   They don't want anything lessening their brand.
Certification would make RH < UNIX I suspect which is not what they want.
Certification has always been about the ISV's, and if they can convince the
ISV to test on their implementation directly (and they have) they don't
need it.

It's the old he who has the gold.  It's a crappy attitude and its just what
pisses people off about MS, Apple or in the old days DEC or IBM.
Sad.
