Hmm. I hate to bring this up, but I've been using the name RetroNET as well. I've had the domain retronet.net registered for ages, and was about to launch a small pilot project with a handful of 3B2 emulators running SVR3, with the hope for many more interconnected systems.

That said, maybe we could pool our efforts? I'd be happy to share the domain name with this effort, since it's precisely in line with what I'd like to see.
