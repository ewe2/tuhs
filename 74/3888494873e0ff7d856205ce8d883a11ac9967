Henry -- most people that I am aware used the original Fortran-IV version
since that was the Lingua-Franca.  The Pascal version was a few years
later, and frankly other than to read the book, I personally never ran the
results from them.  But I can say I did use the original Fortran version
under VMS back in the day.  As bwk says in the Pascal edition, it was
actually a difficult thing to do because Pascal lacked many features that
really made it uniform across implementations, portable between systems
themselves, and as a reasonable systems programming language.  See: Why
Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language

          the V7 manual are also included.<br>
          <br>
          Starting with the Tenth Edition version, I set about to
          modernize<br>
          the code and get it to compile and run on a modern-day system.<br=
>
          (ANSI style declarations and function headers, modern include
          files,<br>
          use of getopt, and most importantly, correct use of Yacc yyval
          and<br>
          yylval variables.)<br>
          <br>
          You will need Berkely Yacc installed as byacc in order to
          build it.<br>
          <br>
          I have only touch-tested it, but so far it seems OK.=C2=A0 &#39;m=
ake&#39;
          runs in like 2<br>
          seconds, really quick. On my Ubuntu Linux systems, it compiles
          with<br>
          no warnings.<br>
          <br>
          I hope to eventually add a test suite also, if I can steal
          some time.<br>
          <br>
          Before anyone asks, no, I don&#39;t think anybody today has any
          real use<br>
          for it.=C2=A0 This was simply &quot;for fun&quot;, and because Ra=
tfor has a
          soft<br>
          spot in my heart.=C2=A0 &quot;Software Tools&quot; was, for me, t=
he most
          influential<br>
          programming book that I ever read.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t think there&=
#39;s a
          better<br>
          book to convey the &quot;zen&quot; of Unix.<br>
          <br>
          Thanks,<br>
          <br>
          Arnold<br>
