=46rom its wikipedia entry:

    The initial Macintosh port was done on a Macintosh Plus
    computer using the Lightspeed C compiler. It was a hybrid
    port in that many of the low-level operations were passed
    on to QuickDraw instead of using the internal bitmap
    code. The application did not conform to the Macintosh
    user interface guidelines as it took over the entire
    screen. The initial version used either available serial
    port as the communications channel. A later update of the
    port could use either ethernet or serial communications.

[No reference to how this was obtained]

Here it says a port to Macintosh-Plus was done in two weeks.
