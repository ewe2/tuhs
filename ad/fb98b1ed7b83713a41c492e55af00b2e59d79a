There is close zero chance I'll ever use this stuff, unless I retire
to teaching in which case I'll make people write PDP-11 assembler.

But I had to come say thanks for doing this.  The PDP-11 was such
an amazingly pleasant machine to program.  I can easily imagine that
translating stuff from assembler to C is pretty straightforward.

RIP DEC, you brought us some good stuff.
