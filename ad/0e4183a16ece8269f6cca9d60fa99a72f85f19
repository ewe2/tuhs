Subject: [TUHS] An Early Unix Group Meeting (funny story)
Message-ID: <bfadd56b-8516-058f-2304-b03df628f493@gmail.com>

I started using Unix in ~1977 at UC Santa Barbara. At some point
around then we decided to host a Unix users meeting in the U-Cen
student union building. We asked the facilities people to prepare
a sign pointing to the meeting room.

Imagine my reaction when I walked into the building and saw
the following sign:

	"Eunuchs Group Meeting - Room 125"

I don't know if any eunuchs actually showed up.
