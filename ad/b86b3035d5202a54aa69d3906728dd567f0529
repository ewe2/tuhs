Maybe I=E2=80=99m dim, but I=E2=80=99ve lost track in this discussion of =
what is missing / corrupted.

sys4.c: I think this is available in BBN V6:
https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3DBBN-V6/ken =
<https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3DBBN-V6/ken>
In this file the only real network addition is Jack Haverty=E2=80=99s =
user timer variable, I think. What else is missing?

imp11a.c: available in two versions here:
https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3DBBN-V6/dmr =
<https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3DBBN-V6/dmr>

impio.c: available here:
https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3DBBN-V6/ncpkernel/impio.c =
<https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3DBBN-V6/ncpkernel/impio.c>=


Maybe the compiler has a different opinion, but they don=E2=80=99t look =
obviously corrupted [??]

Also, the BBN-VAX files may be a solution. BBN sent four tapes with snap =
shots to CSRG in 1981. The TUHS website has the newest version, but =
there are 3 older ones (all 4 come from Kirk McKusick=E2=80=99s DVD =
set). They all have a slightly different set of files. These tapes also =
have IMP and ACC drivers in them, along with a token ring driver that =
was apparently based on Noel=E2=80=99s work back in the day. These files =
may also help filling in blank spots in PDP11 files.
