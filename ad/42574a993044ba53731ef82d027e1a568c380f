Nothing I'm aware of. I didn't mind throwing "tac" over the wall, because
it was trivial, probably a couple hours work for me, under a minute for
Ken. But the rsort source is not at all trivial, and still of potential
value to AT&T.

The source managed to get out as part of the "Hancock" project. I found a
link in

https://www.wired.com/2007/10/att-invents-pro/

but the page is gone. It probably didn't help that Wired titled the article

*AT&T Invents Programming Language for Mass Surveillance*

That's horse-pucky, akin to "Pitchfork makers invent device for spearing
babies". I'm trying to track down a copy that was released publicly. I'm
not hopeful.
