https://www.usenix.org/publications/login goes back to 1997, but it's all
webbed up and not suitable for archival.  Between its increasing focus on
web nonsense and the inexplicable canning of SAGE, I dropped my USENIX
membership a while back.  This thread has served to make me look closely
as to whether I am getting any actual value out of my ACM membership.
