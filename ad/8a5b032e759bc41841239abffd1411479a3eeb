Searching at Google Groups (which is not a trivial undertaking; posts
found by  "Search by relevance" vanish when you search by date) finds
http://groups.google.com/group/news.software.b/browse_thread/thread/64ca4e7650f22ac7/12af7af3e5bef5b9 ,
which is by Henry and dated November 12, 1987.  So he definitely
said it.  However, it's in his .sig, which may mean that he was simply
quoting someone else unnamed.

http://www.linfo.org/q_unix.html has some classics including Henry's.
http://nickelkid.net/docs/quotes/unix.html also has good ones once you
scroll down past the Windows quotes.

My former boss Len Silver said, back around 1983:  "What you're saying
is that Unix is a local minimum?"  He was a physicist turned quant at
a Wall Street firm.  "Exactly," said I.
