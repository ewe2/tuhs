Apologies if this is a FAQ, but is there any prayer of getting 8th,
9th and 10th edition Unix released under some sort of public or
educational licence?

Now that there are emulators freely available which are capable of
running 32V-derived Unix, there would be some practical educational
value in having them available; and I for one would be utterly
thrilled to be able to see them "in action" (as well as see more of
the evolutionary steps from research Unix on to Plan 9).

cheers,
