This is the prior license.  It contains wording like:

2.1 (a) CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, INC. grants to LICENSEE a personal,
        nontransferable and nonexclusive right to use, in the
        AUTHORIZED COUNTRY, each SOURCE CODE PRODUCT identified in
        Section 3 of this AGREEMENT, solely for personal use (as
        restricted in Section 2.1(b)) and solely on or in conjunction
        with DESIGNATED CPUs, and/or Networks of CPUs, licensed by
        LICENSEE through this SPECIAL SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT for
        such SOURCE CODE PRODUCT. Such right to use includes the right
        to modify such SOURCE CODE PRODUCT and to prepare DERIVED
        BINARY PRODUCT based on such SOURCE CODE PRODUCT, provided
        that any such modification or DERIVED BINARY PRODUCT that
        contains any part of a SOURCE CODE PRODUCT subject to this
        AGREEMENT is treated hereunder the same as such SOURCE CODE
        PRODUCT. CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, INC. claims no ownership
        interest in any portion of such a modification or DERIVED
        BINARY PRODUCT that is not part of a SOURCE CODE PRODUCT.

That's not the BSD-like license under which they re-released the code
last year.
