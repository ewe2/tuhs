Ah that makes sense, I could totally see that happening.. Esp with the cost
of hardware back then!  It is insteresting reading about people haveing
600MB of storage back in 1981.. I can only imagine how much it'd have cost!

Thanks again!

Back in the V6 days, I was known as Mr Unix 6-and-a-half, because I'd 
spliced all sorts of V7 features into V6 - notably XON/XOFF, and there was 
no way that V7 would run on the 11/40,

I rewrote the Calcommp and Versatec plotter drivers to use the block 
interface, and they went like a bat out of hell.

Sigh...  We had fun in those days.
