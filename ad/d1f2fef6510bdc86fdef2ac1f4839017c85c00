FWLIW, I also bought a copy, way back when, and I've just made an unencumbered 
version, containing only the 386BSD binaries, the 386BSD source trees, and 
the manuals.

It contains only the BSD-copyright material; everything else appears to be Dr 
Dobbs-copyrighted, thus off-limits; but I'll upload the tar.bz2 file (2MB) if 
people feel it's needed.

I did at one stage sanitize the MS .hlp file documentation, turning it into 
ASCII with MS-DOS cr/lf, but I threw that away at some stage.

Again, FWLIW, the CDROM wouldn't boot on my hardware when I bought it, and I 
couldn't access the source - without putting some thought into it.  I 
eventually did, and copied it to my Linux machine.

Anyone interested?  Warren?  (I did think of attaching it to this email, but 
figured out that was unfriendly and would lead to tears, so I didn't ... :)
