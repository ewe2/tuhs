Our 11/60 certainly had it; I remember scouring the manual, trying to make 
sense of it, but after five years studying at UNSW and eight years working 
there (almost got long service leave!) I got itchy feet.  Besides, 
although the CSU was a great place to work, I didn't like the plans to 
merge it with the Chancellery (the bureaucratic centre), lest I come to 
work one morning and find myself working on a COBOL program...

The provenance of the beast was that apparently a deal with some big 
publishing house fell through (Limited News, perhaps?) and DEC was stuck 
with a warehouse full of them; it seems the WCS was to be used for the 
typesetting or something, I dunno; they could always have yanked the WCS?

Don't all 11s have the same key?  I used to carry one on my key-ring.
