I'm not a lawyer nor play one on TV.   That said, I talk to a lot of them
and have worked for firms that have to deal with this sort of issue.  Your
milage may vary ....

​This is from some one who used to work for TPC who took out a copyright on
every page in the phone directory.​

As I understand it from my legal folks, it is all post the Franklin/Apple
case.    Making sure all object files also have legally recognized set of
stamps in them.

I suspect one can argue with the judge that a single copyright notice are
coving all of the SCCS stamps on from all the files shipped in the release
(source or binary).  But just like putting a copyright on every page in the
phone book, I think the argument is that a page can ripped from the phone
book and a binary and can copied from a system.   Because of the 'motion'
of the object, making sure every object has a mark is best.
