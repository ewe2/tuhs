Thanks for the note. I thought about it and tried it out even though I 
don't see the ^H (my cursor backs up a space).

After typing echo "\^H" | od -c, here's what it looks like:

$ echo "" | od -c
0000000  \b  \n
0000002

So, sure enough there's a backspace in there and my code "sees" it too:

$ echo "" | 1-8
<<BACKSPACE>>
$
