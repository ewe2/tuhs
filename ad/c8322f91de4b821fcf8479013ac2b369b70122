Nice.  Any chance you want to do a TCP/XTP comparison?

Bandwidth is not allocated/reserved, but a path is and routing information is set up at each hop. The other cost is in the relatively verbose switch-host communication in this phase. This compares to the 3 packets exchanged at the hosts??? driver level to set up a TCP connection, with no permanent resources consumed in the network.

No need to deal with packet fragmentation, stream reassembly and congestion storms as in the TCP of the early 80???s.

On each switch, the hosts would be known by name, and each connection request had a service name as parameter. In an alternate reality we would maybe have used ???ca/stclara/mtnview!google!www??? to do a search.
