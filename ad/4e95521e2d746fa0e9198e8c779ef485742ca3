Case study (read, war story :-) of non-blocking I/O...

Back in the mid-70's, I was doing scientific support programming for an =
X-Ray sky survey,
using Fortran-63 under DRUM SCOPE on a CDC 3800 system which NRL's Space =
Sciences Division
had (sigh) acquired and cobbled together from the US Government "excess =
property" list.

Most of the time, our satellite was used in "scan mode", spinning on an =
axis which pointed
at the Sun.  This let us collect data on a two degree wide strip of sky. =
 So, every six
months we scanned the entire X-ray sky.  The track was basically a =
helix, bent to match the
shape of the Earth's orbit.  Every so often, in order to look at a =
particularly interesting
area, the spinning would be stopped, so the instrument could be put into =
"point mode".

The challenge was to "bin" this data for further analysis.  We did this =
by loading sets of
7-track tapes onto a CDC 813 drive, then dumping it out into 36 2x10 =
degree bins.  This put
a quarter of the data onto a set of tapes.  Rinse, repeat for the other =
3/4 of the data
(after skipping past the already-written data).  The result was 36 =
tapes, each holding an
8x10 degree bin (plus one extra tape for any point mode data).=20

IIRC, we had five tape drives; my challenge was to keep them all as busy =
as possible, so as
to dump the data set expeditiously.  Because I had asynchronous I/O =
(mostly in the form of
BUFFER IN and BUFFER OUT commands), I was able to implement a simple but =
quite effective
polling loop.  The machine room was a bit of a madhouse, but the tapes =
were written about
as quickly as the hardware allowed.  Asynchronous I/O FTW...
