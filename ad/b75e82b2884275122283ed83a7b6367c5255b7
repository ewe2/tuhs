Subject: [TUHS] 4.3 Wisc file transfer
Message-ID: <850255f3-8ce3-a051-51c7-cb11fcdb0aab@mhorton.net>

Apologies if this is already on the list somewhere.

What's the best way to transfer files in and out of the simh 4.3BSD Wisc 
version?  I can do it with tape files, but it seems like FTP or ssh or 
NFS ought to be possible, and none is behaving at first blush.

Also, what's the recommended way to shut down the system?  I shutdown 
now to single user, then sync a few times, then ^E, but when I boot 
again I get fsck errors serious enough to require a manual fsck (which 
generally works fine.)

Thanks,

     Mary Ann
