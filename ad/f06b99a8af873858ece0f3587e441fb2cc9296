And if each resource has a directory (possibly organized in a
multiple-level hierarchy) containing several files that describe
attributes of that resource, what are you to do when you want to print a
report listing a summary of some information about those resources, one
per line? And of course the information in these files is numeric -
surely you don't expect the database of descriptions to be compiled into
the kernel. So the tool has to go and fetch those too.
