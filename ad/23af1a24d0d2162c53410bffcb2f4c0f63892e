And you are just figuring this out now ;-)  (Yes. Rhetorical. I know!)

I see they finally fixed the bits in the 'Ethernet' entry explaining the reason for the 1518 byte maximum length of an Ethernet frame.  How many Wikipedia authors even know how to *spell* 'vampire tap'?

For even more giggles, search on something like 'what is the reason for the minimum size of an Ethernet frame'.  When I'm bored, I do.  Who can't be impressed by gems like this?:
