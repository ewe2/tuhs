Subject: [pups] Problems booting PDP11/40 using vtserver
Message-ID: <200201282311.KAA03402@psychwarp.psych.usyd.edu.au>

2.11BSD won't work on a PDP11/40, although 2.9BSD should. If the secondary boot
loaded, you should get a prompt '40Boot' for your processor. You haven't said
how much memory you have. Also, the 11/40 has several cpu options, and the
memory management and line time clock options are required for Unix to work.
Check that there is a register at 772340. If it is not there, then the memory
management options isn't installed.

PS

The only flow control settyings that will work is XON/XOFF. The DL style
interfaces used on all PDP11 consoles, have no useful silo, and interupts
for each character input or output. None of the kernels I know support the
dataset signals, other than some will assert DTR on open.
