Good question.  I like it here, I like old Unix.  I have little fondness
for all the commercial unices, see http://www.bitmover.com/lm/papers/srcos.html
for my reasons.

I think you may be confusing my dislike for commercial unix with a dislike
for unix.  If so, that's mistake because I love Unix.  I've dedicated a
huge portion of my life to helping unix as best I can.
