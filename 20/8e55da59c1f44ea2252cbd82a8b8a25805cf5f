Wanted to post my notes as plain text, but the bullets / sub-bullets get =
lost.

Here is a 2 page PDF with my notes on Research Datakit:

https://www.jslite.net/notes/rdk.pdf

The main takeaway is that connection build-up and tear-down is =
considerably more expensive than with TCP. The first cost is in the =
network, which builds up a dedicated path for each connection. Bandwidth =
is not allocated/reserved, but a path is and routing information is set =
up at each hop. The other cost is in the relatively verbose switch-host =
communication in this phase. This compares to the 3 packets exchanged at =
the hosts=E2=80=99 driver level to set up a TCP connection, with no =
permanent resources consumed in the network.

In compensation, the cost to use a connection is considerably lower: the =
routing is known and the host-host link protocol (=E2=80=9CURP") can be =
light-weight, as the network guarantees in-order delivery without =
duplicates but packets may be corrupted or lost (i.e. as if the =
connection is a phone line with a modem). No need to deal with packet =
fragmentation, stream reassembly and congestion storms as in the TCP of =
the early 80=E2=80=99s.

Doing UDP traffic to a fixed remote host is easily mapped to using URP =
with no error correction and no flow control. Doing UDP where the remote =
host is different all the time is not practical on a Datakit network =
(i.e. a virtual circuit would be set up anyway).

A secondary takeaway is that Research Datakit eventually settled on a =
three-level ascii namespace: =E2=80=9Carea/trunk/switch=E2=80=9D. On =
each switch, the hosts would be known by name, and each connection =
request had a service name as parameter. In an alternate reality we =
would maybe have used =E2=80=9Cca/stclara/mtnview!google!www=E2=80=9D to =
do a search.=
