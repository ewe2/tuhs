reasonable.
I write all my quick references in plain nroff since many years. There are =
gui editors, gui viewers, and lots of cgi search engines && web viewers eve=
n with hyperlinks. Even under good ole emacs techinfo is redundant, as 'wom=
an' can do hyperlinks, which were the only advantage of techinfo in a remot=
e past, however time goes on. Today we have help2man, hence the lazy ones c=
an do man pages too.


'The problem is that the ecosystem has been fragmented by people doing thei=
r "documentation" in their preferred formats instead of in a common (man) f=
ormat. This makes the experience one of "is there any documentation?" follo=
wed by "what's the incantation to get it?" When you're looking for the docu=
mentation for pdf2svg, for example, and there is no man page, how long does=
 it take to figure out that there is no documentation at all? '

that's true. In the early 90ths they forced us writing quick references wit=
h .html. Big confusion. Soon later I found myself converting .html back int=
o nroff because that's the UNIX style.
I know some of us don't like to hear that, but with regards to the gnu tool=
 chain, Richard did a lot of good things, however the politics of replacing=
 man by techinfo definitely wasn't.
