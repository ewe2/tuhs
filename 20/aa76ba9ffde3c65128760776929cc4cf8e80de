Thanks, Adam.  I've always been proud of that driver.

Further credit - 'ned' was written by Dan Walsh (not the Redhat one), and,
like vi, it has 'ed' buried in it so all the familiar stuff just works.

It's possible to use UTS with ASCII terminals, but the hardware only
supports half-duplex, buffered, mode! I suspect it'd be possible to hack
the 270x emulator in Hercules to make it appear really full-duplex - then
one could add the real 'vi', etc.  But that would not be faithful emulation.
