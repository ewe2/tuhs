OK, so now that everyone mentions it, I was wrong. I think I only
had to do this same kind of thing once though.

We ran the Mt. Xinu 4.3 BSD + NFS and it had YP also, so at some
point they were doing it and I sorta think we had /etc/nsswitch.conf
on the vaxen, but I could be wrong. We definitely had it on the SunOS 4.0
Sun servers that we bought later on.

Our connection was via CSNet - slow X.25 line to Georgia Tech and from
there to the rest of the world. We most certainly did NOT do daily FTPs
of the HOSTS.TXT file or anything like that.  At the time we had very
few TCP/IP-savy users; you could probably count them on two hands and
have a few fingers left over. :-)

Those were the days. :-)
