Yes, I did 448. Various bits and pieces that were fixed there, but 
unfortunately I haven't managed to reach Steve to get it officially 
sanctioned.

I've passed it out a few times, but there is no canonical place for it.

You can find it at ftp://ftp.update.uu.se/pub/pdp11/2.11bsd/

Feel free to pass that information around.

Things fixed in there:
. Added a timeout to boot prompt for automatic boot
. Made console 8-bit clean
. Changed gethnamadr to fall back to /etc/hosts if dns fails.
. Fixed kernel build process to get version and date properly into kernel.
. Fixed raboot to work on non-DEC mscp controllers
. Fixed tmac macro to work correctly after 2009.
. Fixed a couple of documentation errors.


Essentially small issues that bothered me as I was running on an 11/84 
with a CMD controller a few years ago. A system on which I also booted 
other OSes, which is why the 8-bit clean issue also bothered me.
(Also was really surprised at the ugly Y2K fix someone had done with 
tmac, which failed again in 2010).
