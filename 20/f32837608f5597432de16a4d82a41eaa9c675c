Yes, of course you are right. I meant BBN TCP used *Arpanet* as its =
primary transport and hence has drivers for the IMP interface hardware.

=46rom Mike Muuss=E2=80=99 TCP digest mailing list and a mail =
conversation with Vint Cerf a few years ago I understood the following. =
=E2=80=9CFlag day=E2=80=9D wasn=E2=80=99t as black and white as we =
remember it now. During 1982 there was a continuous push to move systems =
to TCP, and over the year more and more systems became dual protocol =
capable and later even TCP only. Because all TCP traffic used the same, =
dedicated Arpanet link number, BBN=E2=80=99s network control team could =
monitor the level of usage. =46rom memory, in the Summer of 1982 traffic =
was about 50% TCP and by October 70%. Presumably it reached 80-90% by =
the end of the year.

During 1982 on 3 occasions, network control activated a feature in the =
IMP=E2=80=99s that refused traffic on link #0, which NCP used to =
negotiate a connection. This caused NCP applications to stop working. =
Again from memory, the first outage was a few hours, the second one a =
day and third one, late in 1982, for two days. This highlighted systems =
that needed conversion and helped motivate higher ups to approve =
conversion resources. It seems that making the switch often involved =
upgrading PDP11 to VAX.

=46rom what I can tell flag day went well, although there were issues =
with mail gateways that lasted for several weeks.

At the start of 1982 there was no (usable) VAX Unix TCP code that I am =
aware of. There were several options for the PDP11, but of those I think =
only the 3COM code worked well. Around March/April there was code from =
BBN (see TUHS 4.1BSD) and from CSRG (4.1a BSD). A special build of PDP11 =
2.8BSD with TCP arrived somewhat later. My impression is that this was =
still the state of play on flag day, with 4.1cBSD only arriving well =
into 1983.=
