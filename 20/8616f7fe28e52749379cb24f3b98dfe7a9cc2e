If you look at the chip architecture, it is pretty regular.
    https://www.esperanto.ai/technology/
and very low power (0.01W/core as opposed to 7W/core on X86-64)
     =
https://www.servethehome.com/esperanto-et-soc-1-1092-risc-v-ai-accelerator=
-solution-at-hot-chips-33/

The equivalent of turrets and porticos and columns and dormers
are IO ports like USB, ethernet, and various GPIOs etc. but they
use only a small portion of the available gates.

IMHO the real issue is that the software folks are *not* providing
and *can no*t provide any sort of guidance for general purpose
computing, as the memory underlying modern programming languages
is so far removed from reality. The situation is sorta like what
happens with people with newly acquired incredible wealth but no
background in how to spend or manage it wisely (and I don't mean
*investing* to get more wealth). At least in that case there are
people who can help you and a tremendous need. Here we can put
billions and billions of gates on a chip and even do wafer scale
integration but these gates are not fungible like money.
