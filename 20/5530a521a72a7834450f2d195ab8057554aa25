Alas, no, Fano died in 2016 at age 98.

More memories: Fano was among the grad students who came to 
ice-skating parties at our house in the mid-40s--the house near
Shannon's later abode. I did not really get to know him until
Multics days. His gravelly mafioso voice would scare you off--until
you saw the irrepressible twinkle in his eye. A beloved and
inspiring leader, worthy of Dave Horsfall's calendar.
