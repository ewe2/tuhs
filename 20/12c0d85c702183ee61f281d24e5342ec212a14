You guys really need to go look at gnu grep.  It blows away unix grep
in terms of performance.

The guy writing that post did gnu grep.  He was also a guy at Intel that 
did all sorts of magic.  I've got a guy working for me, crazy smart guy,
his job at Intel was taking Haertel's code and dumbing it down so they 
had some chance of supporting it.

Read that post, Mike is one smart dude.
