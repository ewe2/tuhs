Hi
This archive contains full sources for 4.2.10 and 4.2.12 .
And You can build working version of the system.
It contains also full installation media (4 floppy images).
So usually You will install the system and You can rebuild the system
using the sources.
It contains also sources of Coherent 3.x.
