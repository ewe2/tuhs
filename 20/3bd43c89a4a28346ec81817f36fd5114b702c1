For background, here are a few selected timeline items:

?/1967	ITS design starts
7/67	ITS first becomes operational
12/67	Multics single process boot on 645
10/68	Initial Multics milestone (8 users)  
01/69	Limited Initial Multics milestone (12 users)  
04/69	Bell Labs drops out of Multics  

(I included the latter since I'm assuming the "time Unix arose" is after the
Bell Labs departure.)

Note: I'm not saying or implying anything about the 3 systems with this; this
is purely data.
