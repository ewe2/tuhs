About the assembler, I am pretty sure that it's substantially
the same as that on the 5th edition tape, so it's likely
that a modified version, without the syscall definitions,
could be produced.

I have dug up another listing of the PDP-11 assembly languge
version, which seems to about contemporary with the
one you have.  The files mostly bear a copyright date
of 1972, but like other printouts from the time,
the datestamps only give month and day, not year.
They are generally from May.  It is post 11/45,
and has segmentation and floating-point support.

Incidentally, it doesn't use any of the system call  names
as such; 'read' is at sysread: and so on.

About assembling it, I'm pretty sure we just did
'as u?.s' and the a.out was ready.  This was before
make, after all.

I replied and asked if we could get either a scan copy of the "other listing",
or if he could send a photocopy to Tim.
