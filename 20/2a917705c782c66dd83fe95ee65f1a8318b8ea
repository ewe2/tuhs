I ported GNU Emacs to the Celerity product line mostly because most of the programmers there wanted it over vi. Not me, I’m a vi guy.

I remember that GNU Emacs launched the first time and then dumped itself out as a core file. Each subsequent launch would then ‘undump’ itself back into memory. All this because launching emacs the first time required compiling all that lisp code.

Does anyone else remember this?
