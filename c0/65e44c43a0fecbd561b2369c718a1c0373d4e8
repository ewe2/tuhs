​I don't remember which comic it was, but about 8-10 years ago one the late

While Intel does do many things well, this one is part of company culture
and I'm not in a position to change it.  I wish I could.  I think the place
would be a small bit happier if it did not take itself quite so seriously,
but that's just my personal opinion.


As the late Roger Gourd used to say: *"Bring me to a sacred cow, and I'll
start up the sacred bbq." ;-) *
