Hi Clem.

I did try Bison first. But, for reasons I have not yet fathomed, the
code makes use of yyval (not yylval!), which is $$ in yacc productions.
Bison does not make that available as a global variable.

I am not sure of the exact provenance. My understanding is that RMS
started with Corbett's yacc and built bison out of it. But I could
be totally wrong.
