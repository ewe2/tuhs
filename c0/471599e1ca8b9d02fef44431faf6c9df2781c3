Anyone find a link to the answer key.  I'd love to check mine.
There's stuff on the test I haven't thought of for years.

(How many users were there on the internet winter of 1994?)

a.  Too many
b.  A lot less than in 2012 but still too many
c.  About the right amount and with a better to S/N ratio than we have now.
d.  The internet, what's that.
