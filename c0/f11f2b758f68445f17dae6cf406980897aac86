Subject: [TUHS] Original 9 track tape of Unix 7th edition from Bell
	Laboratories.
Message-ID: <4311F30D.2030703@peacemax.org>

To all concerned,
    I discovered this little gem up for auction on E-Bay.
    One of the stickers state that it is Seventh Edition from Bell Labs
    I have placed a small bid on it ($5.00 US).

Advice required:
1. Would it be worth continuing to bid on?
2. What should my highest bid be?
3. Would TUHS be interested in the tape if I should win it? I don't have 
a tape machine or computer for such tape.

Thank you,
James Falknor
