is the Unix implementation free for the public?From: Arthur Krewat &lt;krewat at kilonet.net&gt;Sent: Thu, 16 Nov 2017 01:22:36To: Clem Cole &lt;clemc at ccc.com&gt;, Bakul Shah &lt;bakul at bitblocks.com&gt;Cc: TUHS main list &lt;tuhs at minnie.tuhs.org&gt;Subject: [TUHS] TECO was: basic tools / Universal UnixSuddenly I fell like I&#39;m in a TECO support group ;)I have my own implementations of TECO - both on UNIX and MSDOS (of all things). They both do colorization of structured programming, something that preceded EMACs colorization by a few years.I always wondered if my released MSDOS version of TECO gave people ideas.When did EMACS start coloring things? I started it in my TECO as of around 1984-1985 - it supported it in text strings, parentheses, etc. From my MSDOS version, showing some MASM code:The structured macros were inspired by Bruce Maier&#39;s structured macros he did for MACRO-10 on TOPS-10 in the mid to late 70&#39;s.&nbsp;On 11/15/2017 2:01 PM, Clem Cole wrote:

Tom Almy&#39;s version,

​I&#39;d forgotten Tom was a teco guy. &nbsp; I&#39;m not sure what happened too it, but at some point Tom and I got the RT11 version (which was in Macro-11 assembler) running in V7 @ Tektronix ​before we had vi. Tom was the biggest user at that point.&nbsp; I was running something Phil Karn had brought to CMU from Cornell (and I took to Tektronix) called &#39;fred&#39; (friendly ed) which had compiled in terminal support. Fred supported glass tty&#39;s; which is why I liked it even though I knew teco &amp; emacs from my 10&#39;s days. &nbsp; Mark Bales came up from Berkeley later that summer and brought 1BSD/2BSD with him (that&#39;s when I learned csh and reprogrammed my fingers to the current rom configuration).&nbsp; Gosling Emacs for UNIX does not show up until we started running Vaxen and had the address space, so at the time it was ed, fred, vi, teco on the 11s.
