I'm probably the only one brazen enough to put it to the test.

For some years, I've wanted to create a free implementation of System V, 
and then move on from there.  (I know there's limited utility for such a 
thing, because of the BSDs.)

A few things actually hinge on this.  If it were considered a fact, and 
not a mere opinion, that 32V was PD, then I could be sure that certain 
things were safe to use, rather than having to rewrite (including some 
particularly tricky stuff the BSDs never fully reimplemented, like 
diff(1)).

I actually did write a replacement for the Caldera header. (I still hold 
that the Caldera license is void because it has a Caldera copyright claim, 
and it has been proven in court that they didn't have the copyright to 
give.)  It just says why I think it *should* be safe to use the code.

-uso.
