Clem,

I am very curious about this UNIX for OS/400 work it sounds either
different or much earlier than what I am familiar with.  I am familiar with
the PASE environment that shipped around OS/400 V4R4 (1999?).  After
AS/400s started running PowerPCish CPUs (there is a bit of history there I
won't dive into) PASE was like WINE for Linux.. same CPU arch, do some
library and linker/loader tricks to hoist a different (AIX 4.3 first)
environment within OS/400s understanding of the universe.  A year or so
later, some very bright group figured to use the OS/400's Single Level
Store as the device model/device virtualization for the CPU virtualization
(LPAR) in later POWER CPUs.  You could run Linux or OS/400 or AIX this
way.  That work was then somewhat inverted, and pHyp was born from the
OS/400's SILC idea of machine dependent code as a light weight firmware
hypervisor in the converging iSeries and pSeries POWER systems.. they
switched the device model/device virtualization to AIX called APV or
PowerVM.

It was nicknamed "Fortress Rochester" for a reason.  They did some very
nice work.  But yeah IBM was running 4 large and extremely different
computing businesses in the 1990s and probably some smaller ones too.  They
were very different but the systems did interoperate pretty well given the
stakes.

Regards,
Kevin
