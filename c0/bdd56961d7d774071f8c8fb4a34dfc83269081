Sorry, I  hit return too soon.

Mary Ann -  I think  PC/IX is what you were thinking.  FWIW: it was one of
the reasons why Andy developed Minix.  He said at the time it was
insufficient and if he was going to have a pure V7 port for the base
8088-based PC/XT (not 286s-based PC/AT) then he wanted something he could
teach with.   IIRC the early PC/IX (and I know for certain Minux did not)
did not even recognize the MMU for the 286 of the AT (much less the later
386), but it did have a driver for the AT disk controller (which was/is a
different controller than the XT).

As Warner says, PC/XT was based on the new System III license we had just
all negotiated earlier that winter.   Microsoft had already started
shipping Xenix on the x86/68000 and I think a z8000 using the V7
license, but I don't think IBM relicensed it.   HP was shipping HP-UX for
the original 9000 on the same, and Tek was also shipping it firsts emulator
system on the V7 license.    DEC had the original v7m which begat Ultrix,
although I don't remember if DEC ever shipped binaries on the original V7
license.  Charlie can correct me, but I don't think IBM ever shipped
binaries on the V7 license either.

[The original V7 redistribution license had terms that makers of $100K+
systems did not mind too much, but was difficult for what would eventually
be called PCs and workstations at the <$10K (much less < $1K) price to
swallow.

FWIW: Years later, Linus famously got his 386 box from his parents for
Christmas, got a copy of Andy's Minux (for a PC/XT), started writing his
terminal program, and was annoyed that it did not use the VM/larger address
space of hardware.
