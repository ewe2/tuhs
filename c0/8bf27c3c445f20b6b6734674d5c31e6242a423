DEC's later diagnostics were excellent.  They were copied by a ton of folks
including Masscomp and Alliant who wrote frighteneningly similar
diagnostic supervisors.

The thing about that is it had a big impact on servicability for those
companies.

1.  They had a large number of Field Engineers in the world with DEC
experience who could
come up to speed quickly.

2.  The diagnostics were easy to learn.

Of course the reason they looked like the DEC ones was that ex-DEC
software engineers
and programmers wrote them.

Concurrent Computer's diags looked very similar to the load and run
stuff of XXDP which
required a lot of knowledge of each diag and it's options.  They were
often called the
"No problem found tape" by Field Service -- because the diags would not
find any issues
and the OS running with full interrupt driven OS's would roll over on load.

On the PDP11 there was XXDP's DEC/X 11 system exerciser... On VMS there was
UETP and just looking at the errorlog output.  The only Unix that came
close to
the VMS errorlog in my experience was the errorlogging on AIX was excellent.
