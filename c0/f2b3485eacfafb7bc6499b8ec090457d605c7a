Let's get it straight. I think Kirk McKusick did the FFS. VM was done
by Somebody Babaglu (a greek? name - I know I'm not remembering it correctly.)
I guess Joy did sockets, but I don't know. I do know that he did the
csh and ex/vi.  I gather he was also in the kernel, but it wasn't all him.

BSD was not a one man show.
