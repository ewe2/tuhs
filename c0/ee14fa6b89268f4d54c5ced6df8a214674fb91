It's possible they added an internal register or two to help save the fault
State but I don't think so. We'd have to ask Les Crudele or Nick T. to be
sure.   As I understand it from my days of commuting with Les to Stellar
and his talking about the project on those trips, the only real difference
between the 68000 and 68010 was Nick's microcode which was in the mask.  I
think they may have stepped the mask in a few places for better yields but
I understand the impression that was not externally electrical different in
function.

[Les was the 68000's main logic designer and Nick wrote the microcode].
