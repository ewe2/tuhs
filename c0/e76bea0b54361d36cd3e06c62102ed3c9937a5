Most of the files assemble, and I've created a "mak" script to do so under
1st Edition. C files are out, they need a later language than the last1120c
compiler. We are missing some files for bas. The dc and form source uses
"new" instructions like mul and ashc, which the existing V1 "as" binary
does not understand, but the assembler in source code does understand,
so these may still be assembled.
