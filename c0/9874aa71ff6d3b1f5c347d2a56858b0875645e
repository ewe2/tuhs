Frank da Cruz wrote a very nice reminiscence of the DECSYSTEM-20s at
Columbia that discusses the creation of CCMD as they decommissioned the
PDP-10s and switched to Unix on VAXen (and then Suns).
http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/dec20.html

When I was a student, we were still given accounts on the CUNIX cluster;
64-bit SPARC machines running Solaris at the time. At the time, the actress
Julia Styles was a student. One day, I was walking out of Mudd (the
engineering building) with a friend of mine who suddenly grabbed my arm and
said, "oh my god oh my god oh my god that's Julia Styles!" Being
perpetually ignorant of popular culture, I had no idea who she was
referring to confusedly thought she meant Julia Child, the late host of a
cooking show. "...But I thought she was dead?" "No, Dan, that's Julia
Child!" We decided to look up Ms Styles in the student directory, but being
a celebrity she wasn't listed. However, one could still discover her "UNI"
(login name) by grepping for her in the NIS password database. We did that
and sent her an email: "Christy was too embarrassed to say hi to you and
Dan thought you were Julia Child." Predictably, she did not respond. In
retrospect, I idly wonder how many such emails she got, most presumably of
the creepy variety, but we just thought ours was funny.

It appears that CUNIX still exists: https://cuit.columbia.edu/unix
