Yep, it could add, but not subtract.  Dammit, but I'm trying to think of 
the CADET acronym; it went something like "Can't Add, Didn't Even Try".

And as for subroutine calls on the -8, let's not go there...  As I dimly 
recall, it planted the return address into the first word of the called 
routine and jumped to the second instruction; to return, you did an 
indirect jump to the first word.  Recursion?  What was that?

Somewhere out there (tm), is a huge list of computer acronyms (and yes, I 
know about "Instant Befuddled Mind", and "I've Been Misled" etc).
