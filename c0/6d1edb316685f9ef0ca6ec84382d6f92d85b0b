It's available at ftp://minnie.tuhs.org/pub/apple2/apple2xinu.tar.gz with
source code, binaries, floopy images and some documentation.

No, it won't run on a real Apple ][ without some work. I actually wrote
it for an Apple clone which had bank-switched RAM and I made use of that
to hide the BASIC ROM and store the OS in the upper 12K. You would also
need to simulate a 10 or 20Hz NMI as well :-)

Cheers,
