E11 starts from a DOS box, which would be fine, since you can set the length 
of the screen buffer in a DOS box, but it takes over the screen. So the 
buffer disappears and the screen becomes only 25 lines long. So the scrolling 
backwards trick doesn't work.

As far as speed goes... under Windows 2000, E11's speed is highly variable. I 
think, from reading the E11 manual, that it has something to do with disk 
caching. I imagine that it's probably much more consistent under DOS, or the 
DOS-based versions of Windows.
