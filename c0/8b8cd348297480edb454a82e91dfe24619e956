I was lucky enough to actually have a chance to use wm at Carnegie =
Mellon before it was fully retired in favor of X11 on the systems in =
public clusters; it made a monochrome DECstation 3100 with 8MB much more =
livable.

When it was retired, it was still usable for a while because the CMU =
Computer Club maintained an enhanced version (wmc) that everyone had =
access to, and Club members got access to its sources.

Did anyone happen to preserve the wm or wmc codebase? There's some =
documentation in the papers that were published about the wm and Andrew =
API but no code.
