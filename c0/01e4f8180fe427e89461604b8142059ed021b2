 There's definitely Rob Pike's talk "UNIX Style, or cat -v Considered 
 Harmful", which he delivered at the 1983 Usenix Association
Conference 
 and Software Tools USers Group Summer Conference. Unfortunately, I 
 can't find it online. It's interesting that the talk's date is now 
 closer to the birth of Unix than to the present.
