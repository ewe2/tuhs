The other problem with storing the path as a string is that if
higher-level directories get renamed, the path would become
invalidated.  If you store the cwd as "/foo/bar/baz/quux", and someone
renames "/foo/bar" to "/foo/sadness" the cwd-stored-as-a-string would
become invalidated.

Sure, you could scan the pwd of all the processes running on the
system and do edit all of the strings, but once you go SMP, the
potential locking pitfalls would be numerous.
