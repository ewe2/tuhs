That's an error message from the shell; the exec() call on the command
('v6tar') is returning an ENOMEM error. Looking in the kernel, that comes from
estabur() in main.c; there are a number of potential causes, but the most
likely is that 'v6tar' is linked to be split I+D, and your V6 emulation is on
a machine that doesn't have split I+D (e.g. an 11/40). If that's not it,
please dump the a.out header of 'v6tar', so we can work out what's causing the
ENOMEM.
