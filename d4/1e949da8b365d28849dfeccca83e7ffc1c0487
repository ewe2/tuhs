It was early days.  People have to spin up, I can't tell you how many times
other people got it and I got it later.

I told Marc that only root could make links to directories or unlink direct=

 no attempt to check permission on the real uid. So I told Marc it would al=

research (I don???t remember what our organization's shared login was).  No=
 one in our organization had root access on research.  Marc and I didn't ha=
ve root access on our organization's machines; Dick Haight et. al. didn't s=
hare that privilege (Dick was the manager of the super-users).   I think th=

 He logged into research, cd'ed to /usr/ken and did an ls -ld codenih, foll=

ine and tried to login as root/codenih, which, of course, worked.  He was e=
