I know of a first-person shooter game that has embedded scripts in the maps.

The scripting language in the maps is ... LISP. ;) - Not sure if it's 
JIT, but it's definitely interpreted and not compiled.

It's been around since the early 2000's, has versions on XBOX and PC and 
newer versions are being released to this day. Knowing the company 
creating these new versions and maps, I doubt they moved away from LISP.

Good ole Halo.
