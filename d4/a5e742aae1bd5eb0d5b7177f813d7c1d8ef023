​Pretty much everyone that was successfull - Masscomp, Apollo, etc...   And

​Hmm...
I looked in my old AMD books, and I unfortunately do not have an AM26xxx
anything in there.
the difference between the MC1489/SN75189 and MC1489A/
SN75189
 is input hysteresis on the receiver side.  I wonder if AMD did the same
when they created the 26L32​

​ to compete with Moto and TI (in those days the 1488/1489 system was king
until MAX shows up on the scene with a single 5v device).

So, I'll give you the text from Page 5-42 of the Moto Interface book on the
1489/1489A:

*The MC1489 input has typical turn-on voltage of 1.25 volts and turn off of
1.0 volt for an input hysteresis of 250mv. ​ The MC1489A has a typical turn
on a 1.95 volts and turn off of .8 volts for typically 1.15 volts of
hysteresis.*


I suspect the A version will work fine, usually the differences was things
like this where they made the part better in real world applications (250mv
of hysteresis for a device that was supposed to be able to handle swing
between +30/-30 volts is tiny).

Best of luck.
