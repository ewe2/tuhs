Robert Michael Owens -- in the utzoo Usenet archives there are very
early posts from him as psuvax!bear. He passed away in 1997; see the
biography here: http://sips2016.rice.edu/bob-owens/

A 1983 post to net.unix-wizards from Bruce Crabill says:

> The Unix version of the RSCS emulator is called UREP (Unix RSCS
> Emulation Program) and is available from Pennsylvania State

> Spooling Communications Subsystem/Networking).
