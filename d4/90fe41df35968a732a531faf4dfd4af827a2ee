May be this is not what Kevin meant but the way I interpreted
his message: smushing everything down to strings for output as
in unix pipelines loses any underlying structure which then
may have to be rediscovered by the next program in the
pipeline by parsing. This is slower, indirect and errorprone.
If one can communicate a structured representation of data between
components that would be better.
