Personally, I'd like to see something using the Heirloom Tools userspace.
Heirloom *roff, in particular, is miles ahead of GNU (especially when
dealing with fonts) while also being much lighter weight. The only bit of
GNU that I'd keep in my "ideal" OS would be GCC, which still produces
better output than Clang.
