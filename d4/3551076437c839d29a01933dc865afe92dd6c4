Yeah, it's crazy.  When I was doing my first sys admin job it was on a
Masscomp that had a 40MB disk for 20 people.  We made it work.

I believe someone announced a 40TB SSD, nope, just looked, Seagate announced
a 60TB SSD in 2016.  WTF, that's a huge drive for rotating, that's insane 
for SSD.

We old farts live in interesting times.
