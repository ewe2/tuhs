 |Dennis' email about #! to Berkeley is dated Jan 10 '80.
 |I've never seen any hint, how the bang in #! was chosen. Looks racy \

 |#! on BSDs was available as compile time option in 4.0BSD (~Oct '80?)

 |BTW, AFAIK, the #! implementation in 2.8BSD (compile time option) is not

 |The BSD csh hack in sh&csh (# special as first character in a file, \
 |service.c),
 |came with 3BSD, also in '80.
 |
 |I found # as comment character in the BSD-sh first in CSRG 4.1.snap
 |(~Apr '81, word.c). And at Bell Labs, as mentioned, it came with SysIII, \
 |also ~81.
 |BTW, 4.3BSD ('86), and thus 2.10 BSD, brought an interesting change:
 |# is only recognized in non-interactive mode. In interactive mode
 |you actually get this:
 |  $ # echo x
 |  #: not found
 |This was not changed in 4BSD until sh was replaced by ash in 4.3 Net/2.

Hmm.  Kurt Shoens added # as a null() saying "The do nothing
command for comments." before that (2BSD, file copyright 1979).
