I also lurk mostly on this ML, but this thread puled my attention.

I run a FreeBSD box as home server, also I own an USRobotics modem which
I've been thinking about connect to the home server and use it to dial

maybe this could be an interesting thing to do now that I have to mount
my setup in a new place.
