CapsLock has its use, it's just that on a typical PC keyboard the key is
unnecessarily large and easy to reach. But it's simple enough to swap it
with -say- Esc. I've been doing just that on X11, Linux console and
OpenBSD console.

See: X11: xmodmap(1); Linux: loadkeys(1), keymaps(5);
     OpenBSD: wsconsctl(8)
