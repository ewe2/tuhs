I've got Quasijarus up and running on simh and experimented a lot with it.
Got some fun with learn(1) program, while ex lessons are quite nasty at 
end :)

Well, but it is quite a resource hog comparing to V7.
So there are questions: is there vi for V7? I heard 1BSD, as set of 
patches/software for V7, contains one, but I might be wrong...
Also, as for simh and Quasijarus:
Is it possible to run simh using tap or other virtual interface to forward 
some 
ports to Quazijarus's services?
The machine, I'll host this stuff on will be on colocation and policy 
there is no MAC address changes and no promisceous mode interfaces and no 
additional ethernet cards...

If that will work, I'll go write socket redirector program (to get free 
consoles from one port using simh) :)

Also are there any ppp/slip software for V7 and 4.3BSD?
This way a problem could be solved other way around...

The best could be have vi under V7 also.

Does V7 support several serial lines to put getty on? Does simh provide 
such a hardware for it?

Will check that soon.

I can't have dedicated ethernet card for it :(

Thanks a lot!!!
