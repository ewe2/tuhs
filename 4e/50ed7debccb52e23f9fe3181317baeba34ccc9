"new" awk was available there, as was Chris Ramming's awkcc, and ksh88.
The awk book from 1987 has instructions and the phone number for logging
into the toolchest. IIRC you set up a UUCP account in order to get
the software transferred.

I think Emacs for Unix (not GNU Emacs) was also available. I don't
remember too much more.
