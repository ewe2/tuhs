Sadly, the answer for some of the Jr. Admins that I've had the ... let's 
say pleasure ... of working with over the last five years cause me to 
first answer "No" and then answer "Yes".

I say "No" because they would get bored and would not actually complete 
the task, much less learn anything.  The answer is obviously "Yes" for 
those that would complete the task.  -  I found that I had to give 
people a caret to get them to want them to put in more effort.  Perhaps 
it's just the batch of Jr. Admins that I was dealing with.

I see and completely agree with your point for those that are properly 
motivated for the long haul.
