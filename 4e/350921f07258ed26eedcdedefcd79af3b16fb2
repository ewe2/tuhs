Anyone remember Desqview/X?  A strange beast, running some window
manager on X on a PC. They made available a variant of gcc and you
could actually compile some X stuff.  I say "some" because I tried
compiling something by running xmkmf+make  and went back to laying
subfloor in an adjacent room.  A few minutes later, I heard the PC
rebooting.  The underlying file system was still DOS and thus 8.3
names.  The source included headers that differed in the 9th place and
the stack eventually blew.
