Every university that allowed "general" student access used disk quotas. I
remember 1MB file quota on the system I had access to. And of course we
found all kinds of tricks to get around those quotas (e.g. "giving away"
large files to someone with leftover quota), which is why on many systems
you're not allowed to chown files if you're not root.
