This is all so asinine it sounds like it=E2=80=99s run by a random haughty =
social
club of people far detached from systems and UNIX and especially far from
publishing systems papers that actually advance the art. Sometimes it is
necessary to let an org know it=E2=80=99s become a joke.  I=E2=80=99d prefe=
r to attend and
assist with something not affiliated with Usenix after reading this thread.
