This is true of the Gurwitz implementation. The Wingfield implementation still uses the older form, where the first 8 bits signify the network and the remaining 24 bits the host address on that network. In terms of routing my view would be to keep it simple: traffic is either local or destined for the single interface / gateway (see below). Interop hence is just looking at TCP.

Yes: all these old implementations have an IMP interface driver at their lowest level. What I'm doing for testing is replacing that by a SLIP driver so that I can hook up to today's network and see if it works.
