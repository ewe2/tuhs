No, 3246 is the same as mine, and my init (which has a few changes from stock) is
2064.

I'm not surprised the later one is 44KB - that's in part due to the denseness
of PDP-11 binary (and the word-size is only 16 bits), but more broadly, I
expect that it goes to my complaint about later Unixes - they've lost, IMO,
the single most important thing about the PDP-11 Unixes, which is their
bang/buck ratio.
