Some time ago, Greg Christie, then at Apple, booted up a 3B2 with a 5620
attached and invited me to play with it. Now _that_ was a trip down memory
lane. (The 3B2, maybe not so much.)

It was a reward for an interview with him, recorded on video, about the
early days of 2d graphics as I saw them, for a course for employees. But
being Apple, even though it was 0% proprietary, it will never see the light
of day.
