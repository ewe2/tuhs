Subject: [pups] Ultrix-3.1 boot tape inside the PDP-11 distribution directory
Message-ID: <000301c273d1$55446520$685e580c@who>

Hello from Gregg C Levine
This is both my first post from this address, and a couple of questions.
Question 1) Has anyone actually followed the instructions and
description of same, found inside the readme file found in the
directory?
Question 2) Was this on actual hardware? Or inside the Simh simulator?
Or even with one version of E11? 

In my case this will be inside the Simh simulator, and I am basically
working straight from the beginning. If all goes well, I'll move it to
the E11 one.
