The original Minix wasn't so open source. It was certainly not GPL'ed
or BSD/MIT licensed.  Also, Tannenbaum had no interest in coordinating
distributed development of Minix into a production-worthy system.

I don't want to rehash all of that here, but I certainly would not
have listed the original Minix as Free Software / Open Source.

My two cents,

Arnold
