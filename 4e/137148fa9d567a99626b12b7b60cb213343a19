OK, well, how do we make this happen?  I'm up in the boonies in Oregon,
don't have an easy way to scan something that big.  I will be in the
bay area next week, and will see Clem and might be able to get him to
haul it back east if that would help.

Funny thing is that I'm not sure that I've ever even looked at the thing.
It's in mint conditions.  Don't have any idea where it came from, maybe
someone else gave me a copy.
