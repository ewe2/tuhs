If NetBSD will run the Ultrix layered products, that would be the system =

  That is the best (most complete) FTN for Vaxen.  I believe there is =
Ada, PL/1 and maybe even Basic2 and Cobol/RPG [I think most of not all =
of the VMS languages for the VAX were released on Ultrix but frankly, I =
don't remember].

I don=E2=80=99t know if NetBSD has Ultrix binary compatibility on VAX, =
but it does on MIPS=E2=80=94so much so that a few years back, someone =
accidentally pointed their NetBSD boot at the wrong partition on their =
DECstation and Ultrix booted right up using the NetBSD kernel!
