Subject: [pups] Stray Interupts
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10102221454580.11275-100000@triangle.cs.uofs.edu>


The Ultrix-11 saga continues but some progress is being made.

Has anyone run into a problem with stray interupts when using RP type
disks with the Supnik emulator??  While I am  not sure they cause any
real problem, they are an annoyance and do clutter up the console
terminal.  May need to figure out how to come up with a remote TTY
and start doing my work (especially kermiting) from there.

In the meantime, I hope to have a full Ultrix-11 development system
running in the next day or so.  That means building all the pieces
needed for a split I&D system.

And now for the obligatory question:
  When I tried run Ultrix-11 on my 11/93 I got a message that said:
"Unknown processor.  enter CPU type in R0 and continue at your own risk."

Anyone know where I might find these magical numbers??  I figure if I
lie and tell him it's a 73 it should at least run.  Yes??  No??

Are the stray interrupts being reported by the Ultrix kernel or the
simulator itself. If the latter, you can always edit out the offending
printfs.

Nope, these are from the Ultrix kernel.  The message itself is put
out by the routine logsi() in errlog.c.  The big question is, is this
a problem with Ultrix or is this a problem with emulator that just
gets ignored by the other OSes.  I would be curious to know if there
is a similar function in 2.11??  If so, it would be interesting to
compare them and see why Ultrix sees all these stray interupts that
no one else sees.

All the best.

	That the messages are coming from Ultrix and not the simulator is
	also is easily determined by grep'ing the simulator sources - no such
	message string that I can see.

	There's no direct counterpart to 'logsi' in 2.11BSD.  The only 'stray
	interrupt' messages 2.11 can produce all come out of networking drivers
	(the LH/DH "IMP" driver if_acc for example).

	The "big disk" support ('rp') was done though by Bob without access
	to a real honest to DEC RP11 controller.  I think he looked at various
	driver sources and perhaps at 2.11's "xp" driver (I vaguely recall
	sending him the xp.c and necessary include files).

> compare them and see why Ultrix sees all these stray interupts that
> no one else sees.

	Various things suggest themself to me: It might just be that Ultrix is 
	overly picky, there's something not 100% accurate in the simulator's
	delivering interrupts or Ultrix-11 has a bug.

	I haven't heard of RT-11 having a problem - perhaps someone could
	try that and see what happens.

	The other thing you might try is the Begemot emulator "p11".  It
	keeps _vastly_ better time than 'sim_2.3d' and has an emulated DEQNA
	so the machine can be placed on a network.  P11's also quite a bit
	more efficient/fast.   Configuration can be puzzling but sample
	config files are available (from various PUPS folks who run P11).

Does Bob (or anybody for that matter) still maintain the emulator??
Maybe the Ultrix source would be a help in better understanding some
of the internals of the hardware.

My experience with Ultrix-11 up to this point would lead me to believe
that it isn't bugs, but I can easily accept that it is overly picky.
That's why I thought the sources might be a big help in tuning the
emulator.

I tried RSTS.  As a matter of fact, I used DSKINT to create my empty
RP06 images.  No sogn of a problem there.

I am using 2.5a of the Supnik emulator.

I would love to us the Begemot emulator.  I have the latest version but
I have been unable to get any of my disk images to work.  Can anyone
tell me if you can use the disk images from the other emulators and if
so, how??  Do they have to be converted somehow like tapes??

Version 2.5a was released on January 1, and Bob recently asked me
to update a pointer to his simulator web page, so I'd say he does.

	That shows how long it has been since I ran that simulator ;-)

	I'll pull it in just to have the latest version around to test with.
