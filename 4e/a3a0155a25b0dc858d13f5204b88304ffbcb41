Well, BSD does that.  But Solaris is the only descendant of System V for
which we have source, which means that in non-Posix cases it can give
us helpful information how the original Unix code fared after leaving
the Labs.  By comparison, both Linux and BSD are clones.

Rather than making ill-conceived suggestions for improvement based on
uninformed guesses about established conventions in a field of study with
which familiarity is limited, it is sometimes better to stick to merely
observing the usage and listening to the explanations offered, inserting
only questions as needed to fill in gaps in understanding. --Peter Constable
