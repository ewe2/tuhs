I have this bit set that on at least some models of the real machine, when
the CPU is halted, it does not do DMA grants? If so, on such machines, the
trick of depositing in the device registers directly would not work; the
device could not do the bus cycles to do the transfer to memory. Anyone know
for sure which models do service DMA requests while halted?
