Howdy all,

	Is it possible that the Unix Archive might be able to get a little
funding or assistance from the Library of Congress? This recent
story in the Washington Post suggests that there is now a lot of
money available in theory at least. I wonder if we would qualify for
funding?

The Library of Congress announced the next step in the effort to 
preserve that history: congressional approval of its plan for the 
National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation
Program.
