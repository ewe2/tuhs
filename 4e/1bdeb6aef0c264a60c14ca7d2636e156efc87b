Seems like a patch might be nice.

Yeah, exactly.  A z80 with floppies seems slower, and was much slower
than a VAX to yourself, but I very rarely experienced that.  40 students
at 4am and the load average was through the roof?  No thanks, I'll take
the predictable speed of my CP/M machine over the VAX any day.  It wasn't
that slow, I got a lot of work done on it.
