MS-DOS 2 took an OS that was largely inspired by CP/M and replaced the 
file API *with that of Xenix* just to add directory support.  Best change 
they ever made.  Now if only IBM hadn't forced them to use \ as the 
path separator instead of /, it would've been slightly better.

Still, MS-DOS was probably the most C-friendly system out there that 
wasn't a Unix or Unix clone.

Bit hackish how they emulated piping, though didn't "Mini Unix" do the 
same thing?
