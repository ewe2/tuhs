I have some vague memories that we had to do something like double the
RAM in our SPARCstations to make Solaris 2 feel comfortable. At the
time, that was a pretty serious outlay in an academic department.
2.5.1 felt like the first version that was _truly_ usable.

Within a single organization, two semi-compatible ways of doing things
seems suboptimal for a number of reasons.

Jon Steinhart reminds me that he said largely the same thing last
week; credit where it's due!

As Warner mentioned, the BSDs also support multiple routing tables,
with the `route` command. To bring it back to ham radio, I
not-so-humbly offer up
https://wiki.ampr.org/wiki/Setting_up_a_gateway_on_OpenBSD as a rather
pedestrian example of their utility.

I would suggest that the latter does not necessarily follow from the
former. But if people want to evolve things, that's ok: after all, the
genesis of this discussion is that we know how to handle breaking
changes.

Except that's what a lot of documentation tells you to do. :-) Really,
`ip` and `ss` are basically fine. The overriding point is that when
one says on the one hand, "we cannot change the way `..` works because
people's scripts might break..." but we fundamentally change the
default network commands on the other, the former seems to be
self-invalidating.

That'll work on a laptop or on my home network (where I set up the
DHCP server). In a large-scale datacenter environment, maybe not so
much.

I would suggest that the number of users who want to run MySQL is much
smaller than the number who want to have a functioning network. But
you're right; it's not that hard to adapt. That was kind of the point;
there have been cases where Linux users have adapted to one degree or
another.

Since shells often have custom (and occasionally inconsistent)
handling of `..`, I'm not sure I'd have a lot of sympathy for that one
either. Why one and not the other? I suspect Clem got it right: it has
to do with the perceived value of the change. The networking stuff had
sufficient value that it was worth the cost incurred (which is low,
but non-zero). Perhaps changing `..` just wouldn't have the benefit. I
argue that it's hard to know those things beforehand.

The `apt install net-tools` thing is a red-herring, though: that's
explicitly why I mentioned Google prod. What works on a single system
doesn't necessarily scale to O(10^6) machines supporting O(10^7)
separately running instances of O(10^4) services in O(10) globally
distributed datacenters, that's just a single organization.
