I've got an AVIV TFC-825 UNIBUS controller on my 11/44.  I'm virtually certain
it emulates a TS11.

It appears to support Pertec formatted tape drives.  It has two
cable interfaces, labeled Pertec P1 and Pertec P2.

I currently have a DigiData Pertec formatted 9-track drive plugged into a
DigiData controller on my QBUS 11/83.  Works fine.   Now I'd like to use
the drive to bootstrap the 11/44.

The DigiData drive's cables are both 49-pin ribbons.  Sure enough,
the DigiData controller's cable headers are also 49-pin (what a wonderful
world, eh?)

However, the AVIV controller's cable headers are 59-pin!

Anyone have any insight into what's going on here?  Isn't a Pertec
interface a Pertec interface?  Or is the DigiData using some kind of
proprietary (to DigiData) interface?

thanks,

greg

Are you sure those numbers aren't 50 and 60, respectively?

For what it's worth, there were two distinctly different "Pertec"
interfaces.  They might be called Early Pertec and Late Pertec.
For Early Pertec, the eventual cable breakout to the drives went
to three connectors, Read data, Write data, and Control.  Possibly
the AVIV controller was meant to be used with a custom cable set
to match a "three-connector" drive.

Are you sure those numbers aren't 50 and 60, respectively?  Most
of the connecting cables for tape drives used twisted-pair ribbon
cable.

For what it's worth, there were two "standard" Pertec interfaces.
I think of them as Early Pertec and Late Pertec.  Late Pertec is
the two 50-pin cables.

Early Pertec connected to the drive with three cables, Read data,
Write data, and Control.  Usually there was a custom cable set
that broke out to three cables from the connectors on the controller.

You're absolutely right.  I just read the pin #s off the boards
next to the connector.  They printed 49 and 59 but, of course, there's
the other row of pins.

I >THINK< I've got that covered.  The "early pertec", as I recall, are
also referred to as unformatted and consist, as you say, of three cables.
I've got a Western Digital UNIBUS TM11 controller that uses three
cables.

The later pertec are referred to as formatted and consist of just two cables.
My DigiData controllers use just two cables to my DigiData drive.

Now this AVIV controller has TWO connectors along its top.  That's for
sure.  But the connectors have each got more pins than the DigiData
controllers do.  As you say, I guess it's possible that the AVIV is
actually an unformatted controller that takes two "large" cables/connectors
and breaks them out later into three smaller cables/connectors.

But that would truly suck.
