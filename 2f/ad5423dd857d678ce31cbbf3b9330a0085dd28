I just checked with another ISP, just to get a data point. Hetzner
(which has datacenters in Germany and Finland, but I'm not sure how
they feel about customers in the US) charge €0.05/GB/month plus VAT
for extra storage volumes; ignoring VAT, 300 GB comes out to
€15/month. 500 GB would be €25/month. Especially for static content,
their low-end VPS would almost certainly be plenty powerful enough for
serving it, so add €2.50/month for that. So starting at some €20/month
for VPS hosting with sufficient storage. They also include 20 TB/month
outgoing traffic in all VPS plans; additional traffic is extra.
ISP-side backups cost an additional 20%. Add VAT to taste.

I looked at the KimSufi 1; that looks like it comes out to $3.35/month
for their cheapest tier VPS, plus $42/month for 500 GB of storage
(next tier down is 200 GB at $21/month, so not enough). So about
$45/month. Not sure if that's inclusive or exclusive of VAT, but
still, about twice the price.

So if a single server is merely nice to have as opposed to critical,
it definitely looks to be doable with a VPS in the 30-50 currency per
month price range.
