So I've encountered lots of holes in NFS files where there shouldn't be
any.  So it is/was a thing.  But that said, I can't remember a single
case of encountering that on Sun's campus.  I don't know if my memory
is failing me, but I do know that when I left Sun and started working
with other NFS implementations, yeah, lots of problems.  Somehow Sun
got it right where other people didn't.  

The point I'm trying to make is that I don't think NFS was broken by
design, it worked when it was Sun servers and Sun clients.  Sun's 
entire campus, 10's of thousands of machines, used NFS.  Sun would
have screeched to a halt if NFS didn't work reliably all the time.
So it was possible to get it to work.

My guess is that other people didn't understand the "rules" and did
things that created problems.  Sun's clients did understand and did
not push NFS in ways that would break it.

My memory may not be the greatest but I can still remember being 
astonished when I first ran into people saying NFS didn't work.
It worked great for Sun and Sun's customers.
