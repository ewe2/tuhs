I still have floopy images for XENIX and SCO UNIX 3.2v2.?, 3.2v4.0,
3.2v4.2.  SCO had to pay royalties on every media shiped.  I can make them
available with proof of purchase.  I am allowed to give all but one of
each set.  I do not have the licence keys and activation keys available or
a way of generating them.  I had PC/IX, but I have been unable to find the
orignal media.  I do not seem to have it in my archive.
