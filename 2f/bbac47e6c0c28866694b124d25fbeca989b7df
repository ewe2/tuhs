That was the thing that tipped me off late in the nineties that Linux was succeeding - only the big 
vendors - and Microsoft - were ignoring Linux, everybody else had Linux-compatibility tick boxes. 
Particularly when FreeBSD incorporated one such item ...

Then when IBM took Linux to the mainframe, it was pretty obvious that it wasn't solely a hobby OS any 
longer.
