Welcome to academic/research code.  :-)

I'm reminded of a description of the Coda File System by Peter Braam;
he said that it was irretrivably tainted by a dozen Ph.D. students
working on their thesis.  Naturally, once they had done the necessary
work for them to get their doctorate, any interest in doing the
necessary code cleanup for their various experimental efforts
evaporated.  He tried cleaning it up, and eventually gave up and
decided to the only solution was a rewrite and redesign from scratch....

I used to be annoyed when professors and their graduate students would
do their work based on same ancient version of Linux.  (In general,
the last version of Linux dating from the professor had time to hack
on code.)  I later decided that was a feature, not a bug, because it
meant no one would be tempted to take academic code and try to put it
into the mainline kernel...
