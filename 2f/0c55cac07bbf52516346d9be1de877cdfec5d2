I speak from experience of trying to install FreeBSD on a netflix server
a couple of years back.  It wasn't pleasant and it seems pretty identical
to the installer I used decades ago.

It's 20 years past the time for that re-evaluation.  Seriously, Linux
distros have been installing in X for at least 20 years, I think maybe
more.  If they can do it....

Nope, it's not remotely stuck.  I get it, you like FreeBSD.  That's fine

bit actually run FreeBSD on their desktop and laptops?  As their daily
platform?
