The primary difference between the 11/40 class and 11/45 class is separate I=
/D space which I sometimes refer to as the 17th address bit because it allow=
s you a full 64k of data space as well as a 64k of instructions space. =20

After you are booted, a 45 class machine will run 40 class binaries unchange=
d.  40 class machines can not run a.outs that are seperate I/D

You=E2=80=99ll probably want to configure a kernel for the 45 class machine.=
  Look at the differences in the *.s files in the kernel. IIRC there is a di=
fferent file for 40 class and 45 class systems

That said if you running the simh I would recommend going all the way to an 1=
1/70 configuration because you can set it up for 4M of main memory.
