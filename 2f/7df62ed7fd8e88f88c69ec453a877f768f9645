IANAL and TINLA, but Caldera *did* have a license to sublicense the
content to third parties (which is not the same as copyright ownership),
so the BSD license should be valid.

If a soldier is asked why he kills people who have done him no harm, or a
terrorist why he kills innocent people with his bombs, they can always
reply that war has been declared, and there are no innocent people in an
enemy country in wartime.  The answer is psychotic, but it is the answer
that humanity has given to every act of aggression in history.  --Northrop Frye
