Or the Ariane 5 flight 501, which according to Wikipedia cost more
than 370 million dollars (and resulted in the total loss of the
spacecraft). I would say a few million or even a few tens of millions
of dollars to double-check the software, or even write new software
specifically designed for the Ariane 5 rather than reuse software
designed for the Ariane 4 outside of that software's design limits,
might not have been a bad way to spend money there.

And that was in 1996. Hardly that long ago.
