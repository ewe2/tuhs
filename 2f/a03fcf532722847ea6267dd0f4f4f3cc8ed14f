Subject: [TUHS] Historical Papers on Unix now online
Message-ID: <201011090610.oA96AcHq002129@localhost.localdomain>

A friend sent this to me. Both of these mailing lists are likely
to find this of interest.  I have a paper copy of the 1978 BSTJ,
either the '82 or '83 issues, whichever one was devoted to Unix. :-)
