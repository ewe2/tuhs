I don't think there are any for the 8-bit Apple IIs, but for the 16-bit 
Apple IIgs, there's GNO/ME unix: http://www.gno.org/gno/

I actually ran this on my IIgs; it was cute, and quite usable considering 
the limitations of the hardware.  I don't know anything about its 
provenance, though.

Anyone else run GNO/ME?  Anyone know if it was based on some previous 
source base or distribution?  Or know the folks behind it?
