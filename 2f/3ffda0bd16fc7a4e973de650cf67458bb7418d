The title of the fmt man page in v9 was "ultra-simple text formatter".
Gnu dropped the "ultra" in favor of AI. Sometimes it does a pretty
job. Sometimes it messes up my typing style. Always it produces a
an apparently wavering right margin, as it assigns a separate
"optimal" line length to each paragraph. It's hard to imagine how
this command could stray from classic Unix simplicity and
intelligibility, but Gnu pulled it off.
