Ah thinks Warner, that was exactly what I was trying to recall.

And I am reminded as well how overloaded the term 'paged' is ... but
yeah, in this case, I was looking for examples where the kernel ran
with essentially no mmu but user programs did.

Note that on Alpha there was an identity mapped space with no MMU as
well but that was only for PAL mode and firmware that used PAL mode
(like LinuxBIOS).

On modern systems we have RISC-V with the no MMU M mode, and I just
got to thinking that running a kernel in M mode would be "what's old
is new again" :-)

Thanks
