That is my vague recollection too.

Which aspect? The ability to assign/pass/return arrays, or the funky way that
array naming worked (I'm trying to remember the details, I think it was
something to do with 'arrays' passed as arguments - it was actually a pointer
that was passed, but the declaration didn't have to say 'pointer').
