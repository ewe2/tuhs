It's documented in the original V7 installation instructions. Effectively,
you start in single-user mode with a shell attached to the keyboard.
You have to disconnect the keyboard with ctrl-D, which then kills the shell
and starts running /etc/rc.

In V7, everything was a dumb terminal: termcap and curses did not exist yet.
And you were expected to have a paper-based terminal too :)
