A fix for this obviously broken etherkiller would be UI. Doesn't
a telephone killer need a Honda portable generator on the
other end of that RJ-11 ;)

ObOT: Considering it is in now the realm of possibilities to
simulate a ~ 1986 internet under a desk and stuff a ~ 1994
geocities in a netbook.. I imagine running close to a billion
x86 emulators under the desk while running a copy of pinterest
and facebook on it. I'll probably need a larger pid_t and rewrite
some shell scripts in Rust or what you have by then.
