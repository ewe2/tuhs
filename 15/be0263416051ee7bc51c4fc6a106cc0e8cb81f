I cannot confirm this at all.

I have access to both SunOS-4.x and Solaris sources and it is obvious that the 
SVr4 and Solaris kernel code is very similar. You could e.g. convert device 
drivers easily from SunOS-4.x to Solaris and I did this for my drivers.

I remember one notable difference between SunOS-4.x and Svr4/Solaris:

	The kernel function as_hole() has been renamed to as_gap() on request 
	from AT&T ;-)

On the other side, the kernels SVr3 and SVr4 are very different and it is close 
to impossible to port a SVr3 device driver to SVr4.
