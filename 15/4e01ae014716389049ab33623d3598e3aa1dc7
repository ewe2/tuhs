Yes, well my first Unix experience was a 2.x.x kernel based Linux system
and I ate it up... although I missed out on the "glory days" I almost
feel like I was there, having learnt everything I possibly can about the
history of Unix, run V7, used simh extensively, ported stuff to/from
2.11BSD, got into the guts of the BSD networking stack, etc, etc...

I have read many DEC hardware manuals and I have been trying to buy a
PDP11 (not micro PDP), ideally it would be an 11/70, although
unfortunately I have just downsized to 2 rooms and advertised the other
2 rooms in my house for rent, so I may have to put that off for a bit :)
I narrowly missed out on a VAX11 in good condition a few years back, my
interest is more in PDP area but VAX is also acceptable.

It's a shame I'm in Australia as nearly all PDP hardware around here
seems to have been scrapped, and also I will probably never get the
chance to buy that beer for the Bell Labs/Berkeley engineers.  But if
I'm in Germany I definitely plan to visit Bernd Ulmann's museum, see
http://www.vaxman.de/museum/museum.html and relive those glory days :)

cheers, Nick
