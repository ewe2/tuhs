Maybe I get some time at the VCFE to investigate this. (Showing 
visitors "live hacking". ;-) )

Sorry don't know. I may be able to reproduce the error later. I got PSU 
trouble when I wanted to do this yesterday...

If I use a different vector (e.g. 404) it tells me that the vector is 
wrong when booting. Maybe I can use a VAX with NetBSD for some 
"probing"....

But when I was compiling the kernel with the new driver the machine 
crashed. The PSU simply stoped working. :-((( It worked again when I 
pulled all non-essential cards and the TK50. Maybe I overloaded the 
PSU? Maybe I will need a new PSU soon? If everything fails I can use 
the BA215 for the PDP-11. I have several spare PSUs for that box. But a 
BA215 is not the "right", "contemporary" enclosure for PDP-11/73.

Nice to hear that I am not the only one who made that mistake. ;-)
