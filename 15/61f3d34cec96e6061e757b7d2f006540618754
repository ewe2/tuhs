Yes, but it didn't help :-(
What can this be?

I tried something else, I copied the contents of the root fs
elsewhere, newfs'd the root partition and copied the contents back.

But now booting stops when it normally starts init,

-------------
: unix
Boot: bootdev=05010 bootcsr=0176700

2.11 BSD UNIX #1: Fri Feb 15 18:47:18 PST 2002
    chris at pdp11:/usr/src/sys/PDP11CPG

attaching qe0 csr 174440
qe0: DEC DEQNA addr 08:00:2b:07:82:6c
attaching lo0

phys mem  = 2097152
avail mem = 1647872
user mem  = 307200

-------------

... and here it hangs. Do I have to consider something else when I
newfs the root partition?

regards,
chris
