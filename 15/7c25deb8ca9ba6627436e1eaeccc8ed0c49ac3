Subject: [TUHS] Trying some new TUHS mail configs
Message-ID: <20170921051736.GA8780@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, sorry for the test post. Grant Taylor has been helping me resolve
the mail bounces, which we think are due to the mailing list preserving the
existing DKIM information when forwarding to e-mail.

This e-mail is going to a test address which should strip the inbound
DKIM stuff before passing to the TUHS list. Hopefully we can observe
the result and check the logs.

        Warren
