I have networking up and running in UnixWare 2.1, on VMware Server 1.0.

VMware Server 1.0 virtualizes the "AMD PCNet" PCI ethernet card, and
UnixWare 2.1 has built-in drivers for it.

Can the virtualization software you are using offer an emulated "AMD
PCNet" PCI ethernet card to the virtual machine where you are running
UnixWare 2.1?

I attach these screenshots for your reference:

And now, it would be nice to have SSHd running. According to this post,
it's doable:

Does anyone volunteer to compile a package for SSHd in UnixWare 2.1,
and share it?
