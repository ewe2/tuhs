For what it's worth, that's a Debian packaging standard.  All
executables are supposed to have a man page.  In some cases it may be
no more than a short summary of the options and then a reference to
the info manual if you want to learn more.  If the upstream package
does not provide a man page, Debian maintainers are supposed to create
a man page, and hopefully contribute it back upstream.

This isn't always the case; but if there isn't a man page, that's
always grounds for filing a Debian bug report.

I'm not convinced the original BSD man page for, say, "make" is really
sufficient to learn how to use make effectively w/o the expanded,
non-man page write up in BSD Unix's Programmers Supplementary
Documents.  So I dare say the goal that the man page should be the
primary manual was a bit of an aspiration goal as well.

That being said, I'm not convinced nroff is powerful enough to be a
source language for info files and HTML files.  For one thing, it
doesn't have the ability to specify hyperlinks.  The GNU an-ext.tmac
extensions does define macros to provide *external* hyperlinks to WWW
URL's.  However, even that doesn't have the ability to specify
*internal* hyperlinks to other sections of the document.

Cheers,
