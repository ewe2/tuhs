He surely did for years before that.  But i mean, hey, just an
observation, i have no idea of american sensitivities.

Yeah i mean, this arose by the beginning of the 90s, right.
If the first examination does not reveal the desired result (but
maybe the truth even, heh), then just perform a second .. a third
one, until the result is absolutely what was wanted.  Gulf war
illness, Barschel's death, W keys on the keyboard .. you name it.
