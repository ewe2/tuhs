like larry said. I'm a grumpy old man. And lspci is not Unix. And neither
is anything we use nowadays that begins with ls and has more than 2 letters.

In Unix, resources have names. They are visible in a name space, organized
into directories. The names can be enumerated by opening and reading a
directory. Information about them can be determined with stat. Their
contents can be read by open and read. They can be changed with open and
write.

it's a pretty simple and consistent model. And it works just fine with,
e.g., the the Plan 9 pnp device. From my point of view, if a user needs
lspci to enumerate PCI resources, it's because the kernel has fallen down
on the job by failing to support the Unix model.

I can argue this point all day, but I'll let it go at that :-)

thanks

ron
p.s. It's not you, it's me. "You, sir, are a curmudgeon"  -- Rob Pike, to
me, on 9fans. As a result of this note, while I was at Los Alamos I was
assigned curmudgeon at lanl.gov. Made my day.
