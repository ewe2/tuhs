Looking at a few online sources, Linus actually said when "386BSD came out,
Linux was already in a usable state, that I never really thought about
switching. If 386BSD had been available when I started on Linux, Linux
would probably never had happened".

Although the dates differ, it seems Linux was released in 1991


Kind Regards,
