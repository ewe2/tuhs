From the talk from Stephen Bourne around 1990 at the Sun User Group meeting, 
/usr/bin started with user contributed binaries only.

Later the directory was aquired by the system after many of the user 
contributed programs have been integrated into UNIX.

At that time people started to use /usr/local and in order to interrupt this 
chain of bad naming, /opt/<vendor>/bin has been introduced.
