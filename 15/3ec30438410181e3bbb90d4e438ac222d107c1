That's just stupid.  I rewarded more functionality in less or the same
lines of code.  Want to add 5K LOC?  Great, find 5K LOC of dead code.

My team worked on on the same project for 18 years, the main source
base grew to about 125K LOC and stayed there even though we added
more and more functionality.  It is possible.
