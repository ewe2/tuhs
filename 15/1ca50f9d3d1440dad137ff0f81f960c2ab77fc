I don't know exactly how contemporary ODS-1 is. It's the file system 
used on RSX-11, and I think it should atleast trace back to around 1972, 
but I can't say more for sure.

Anyway, ODS-1, just like the Unix file system, have the directory hold 
just the filename and a file identifier (pretty much the same as inode 
number). There are of course some differences in details, but I would 
say it is very similar to how Unix works. ODS-1 do not have reference 
counting, but instead allows dangling directory entries that do not 
point to valid files. Instead ODS-1 have a generation counter for each 
file identifier, so that when it is reused, links to the old file will 
not accidentally refer to the new file.

I would think that something like Multics had something similar, but I 
have no idea about that one...
