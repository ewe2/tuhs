 I realize this doesn't help but there's an old story about dmr being asked
in the early or mid 80's to look at a clone which he checked for specific
bugs he was aware of (but apparently no one else was). It turned out to be
clean. I don't remember the details but that might be a good starting
point?

Apologies to Andrew who gets this mail twice (in his in his private
mailbox, and on the list). I assumed gmail would send it to the list as I
intended but it didn't, so I had to resend. Sorry!
