Exactly this.  I'm a very fast reader, easily 2-3x the average.  I read by
running my eyes down the middle of the page and get the left and right
from peripheral vision.  It's super fast but it doesn't work when you
get much bigger than 80 columns.

Even if you read normally, the wider it is, the more back and forth your
eyes do so less is more.

It's also why I'm fine with smaller screens, I tried the giant apple
displays and found that those required head movement along with eye
movement.

I'm lazy.
