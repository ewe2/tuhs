Try Cantonese… 9 tones, or 10, or 12.  Nobody agrees on how many which makes it all the more fun.  The more I learn, the more I don’t know it just adds in more confusion.

I never realized I was tondeaf until I moved to Hong Kong.

Tonal languages are real fun. I'm living and working in Bangkok,
Thailand and slightly tone deaf am still struggling.

Which reminds me, regarding binary there are 10 types of people, those
who understand and those who don't :-)

Cheers,
rudi
