â€‹Warren - please correct me if I am mistaken/changed this since the last
time I checked up on these things, the PUPS mailing list was retired as the
URL for the PUPS mailing list on the PDP Unix Preservation Society Home Page
<http://minnie.tuhs.org/PUPS/> says it is out of date and tells people to
go to TUHS and the mailing list URL  Subscribe to the PUPS mailing list
<http://minnie.tuhs.org/mailman/listinfo/pups> comes back as "No such list:
*pups*"
