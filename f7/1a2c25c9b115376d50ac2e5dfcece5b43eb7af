quote of Aho from an interview ---

 "We [Aho and Kernighan] had created a grammatical specification for AWK but
  hadn't yet created the full run-time environment. Weinberger came along
  and said 'hey, this looks like a language I could use myself', and within
  a week he created a working run time for AWK."
