That would make sense. SysV is about twenty years old, and its status  
as an ultra-holy reliquary of trade secrets and whatnot has been  
severely dented by Sun's open-sourcing of Solaris.

If anyone knows who to contact at Attachmate, I'd say, go for the  
full bag, of Research Unix and commercial Unix.
