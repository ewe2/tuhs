JHU ownership was a bit more of a kludge.    If your GID was less than 200,
then everything worked the normal UNIX way.
If your GID was greater than 200, then it was also taken to be part of the
UID.   The student accounts would have a GID based on the class that they
were in.

Of course, newgrp, setuid, setgid (and their related bits) had to be changed
to avoid secuirty fun and games.    I spent a lot of time trying to break
that when I was just a student.
When I became one of the system programmers, I spent a lot of time trying to
fix those holes.

We dropped the GID (nobody used them) and glued it onto the UID, thus making
it 16-bit.
