Which sez:

  There is a second document, untitled, no date, which I have not been able to
  locate online at all.
  ..
  From the content, it seems to be from shortly after the previous one, so say,
  circa 1977.

I poked around in a dump of the CSR Unix which I now have available to me, and
found a copy of it. I just checked the Internet (using the canonical search
engine) for various phrases from it, but I still could not turn it up. So,
here it is in machine-readable form:

  http://ana-3.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/history/unix/CChanges.txt

Hope this is some use to someone... :-)
