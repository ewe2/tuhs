VMWare can do the standard ‘ide’/WD-1003 type interface, you either have to edit the VMX/master VMDK, or set the right ‘OS’ type during install.  Try MS-DOS or ‘Legacy OS/2’.

From my old notes:

First, edit the .vmdk file.  You are looking for the line:
ddb.adapterType = “buslogic”
And you change the buslogic to ide like this:
# Extent description
RW 16777216 VMFS “UnixWare 7.1.1-flat.vmdk”
# The Disk Data Base
#DDB
ddb.adapterType = “ide”
ddb.geometry.cylinders = “1044”
ddb.geometry.heads = “255”
ddb.geometry.sectors = “63”
ddb.longContentID = “8f535bb60df8d73a86c24853fffffff
The next thing is to alter the vmx file.  By default the hard disk will be on scsi0 and you’ll see something like this:
scsi0.present = “TRUE”
scsi0:0.deviceType = “scsi-hardDisk”
scsi0:0.fileName = “UnixWare 7.1.1.vmdk”
scsi0:0.present = “TRUE”
And what we do is rename the scsi0:0 to ide0:0
ide0:0.present = “TRUE”
ide0:0.deviceType = “disk”
ide0:0.fileName = “UnixWare 7.1.1.vmdk”
scsi0:0.present = “TRUE”
And you should be good to go.  The other (much easier) alternative is to try to use the legacy OS/2 profile as it’ll install an IDE disk by default.

If I could get the Consensys running that I used to have that would be 
great, it would be "authentic" to me at least.

However, it relies on either an Adaptec 1540 SCSI controller, or the 
standard ISA WD MFM/RLL controller (and maybe ESDI), which my VMware 
environments can't support. I'm reluctant to go into running yet another 
emulator anywhere on my home office network, so it might be Unixware 2.1 
which I managed to get running in VMware.
