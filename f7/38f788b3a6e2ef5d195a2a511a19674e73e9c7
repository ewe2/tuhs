Message-ID: <4.3.2.7.2.20010204155043.045c7d50@cirithi>

That RK05 image boots on an 11/34A just fine.   (I own one.  Trust me.  It 
just works.  No fiddling required).

Perhaps you have a plain 11/34, and perhaps there is some difference that 
matters.

But they should both have MMU, but perhaps the MMU in the 34A is different 
than a 34 in some odd way.

Do you have floating point?  Maybe that's the problem.

You could always try mini-unix...  8-)  That should run (it ran on an 11/20).

Yes, but it doesn't boot on an 11/34 :(
That's the problem.

Greetings,

I have a PDP-11/73 on which I have installed 2.11 BSD from the PUPS
archives. I have a few hardware configurations questions that I hope
someone might be able to help me with.

The memory board that I have was made by Clearpoint Inc. The board
has the markings Q-RAM 44B REV. B and GSB-2. Unfortunately, I have
no documentation for the board. The board originally had 1 MB
installed, and I added another 1 MB of chips. The extra chips were
not recognized though. Does anyone have information on the jumper
settings for this board?

I have two MSCP controllers installed. One is a CMD CQD-220/M SCSI
controller with one drive attached, CSR is the first MSCP controller,
and unit is set to 0. The second is an RQDX3 with an RX50 attached. 
It is set with CSR at the second MSCP controller address. The 
jumpers are set for unit 1. The result is that I have a SCSI drive
at DU0 and the RX50's at DU4 and DU5 during boot.

DU0 is ra0 and DU4 is ra12 in 2.11 BSD. If I change the jumpers on
RQDX3 to unit 2, I boot at DU8, the first RX50, but I can no longer
access the floppies from 2.11 BSD. Looking at the sources, it seems
that the drive number is limited to 0-7, but the controller seems to
want unit number 8. What am I missing? This seems to occur both in
the kernel and in the standalone installation system.

Hi -

	'fraid I can't be of help with the memory board - that's not
	my area of expertise.

> I have two MSCP controllers installed. One is a CMD CQD-220/M SCSI

	Ah, but I can help with getting the dual MSCP controller
	question.

	My 11/73 is similar - it has an Emulex UC08 and the original
	RQDX3 (with an RD54 and a RX03).

	Ignore anything you might know about DU numbers ;)

	2.11 numbers the drives 0 thru 7 on _each_ controller.   Thus
	'ra0' thru 'ra7' are on the first controller, 'ra8' thru 'ra15'
	on the second controller and so on.  There is a maximum of 4
	controllers supported (two bits in the minor device number).

	The standalone I/O system uses device names of the form:

		dev(ctlr, unit, part)

	where 'ctlr' is the controller number (0 thru 3), the 'unit' number
	is 0 thru 7 and the 'part' is the partition number (0 thru 7).   So,
	to access the first drive on the second controller from a standalone
	program the name would be:

		ra(1,0,0)

	you probably will be prompted for the CSR since 'boot' and friends
	only know about the first controller's address.

	Once the kernel is loaded you access drives on the 2nd controller
	with device names such as /dev/ra8a, /dev/ra9a, and so on.   

	The "sparse" numbering was chosen (eons and eons ago) to make the
	MSCP disks look more like the traditional disc controllers which
	allowed for 8 drives per controller.

	In my /etc/dtab file I have:

ra      ? 172154 154    5       raintr          # uda50, rqdx1/2/3
ra      ? 172150 0      5       raintr          # 2nd uda50/uc08

	From the console ODT prompt (I've an older MXV11 boot set up) I
	use "172150 du 0" to boot from the SCSI disk attached to the UC08.
	When the system is up the RD54 (which is unit 0 on the other MSCP
	controller) is accessed as 'ra8' (and the RX03 which is unit 1 
	accessed as 'ra9').

	It's pretty simple and regular once one knows what is going on ;)

My /etc/dtab is:

ra      ? 172150 154    5       raintr          # uda50, rqdx1/2/3
ra      ? 160334 160    5       raintr          # secondary mscp

The CQD220 is at 172150 and the RXDX3 is at 160334. Is 172154 a valid
MSCP address? It must be, cause it works for you. The docs I have
show 160334.

On booting the 11/73 and starting 2.11 BSD the following occurs:

DU8 and DU9 at boot are the RX50 drives on the second controller. The
floppy in DU8 contains the installation standalone utilities that were
part of the installation tape, including icheck.

I agree that it is pretty simple as you describe it and it is what I
expected,
but it does not seem to be as I see it here. Could the problem be that I
am
booting from the second controller? Should all the controllers be
jumpered for
unit 0? Now that I think about it, it may be the boot firmware that is
uncooperative. If I set the RQDX3 for unit 0, I cannot boot from the
second
controller's first disk, but I can from the second. So, I should set all
the
controller unit numbers to 0. The restriction is that the boot device
must
be visible to the firmware. Make sense?

...

OK, I moved the RQDX3 to unit 0, and the boot floppy to the second
drive.
The boot is then:

Thanks for helping me work through this. It looks like the boot device
must be
within the first 8 devices that the firmware can see, but 2.11 BSD wants
all
the unit number jumpers set to 0.

Thanks for helping me work through this. It looks like the boot device
must be
within the first 8 devices that the firmware can see, but 2.11 BSD wants
all
the unit number jumpers set to 0.

Hi -

> From: "Chuck Dickman" <chd at nktelco.net>
> What you described here makes sense and was my first impression of

	I'm wondering if the console/boot firmware might not be the
	cause of some of the confusion.

> My /etc/dtab is:
> 
> ra      ? 172150 154    5       raintr          # uda50, rqdx1/2/3

	Looks good.   With 2.11 you can, if you want, leave the interrupt
	vector as 0, the kernel will allocate an available vector and
	tell the MSCP controller what vector to use.

> The CQD220 is at 172150 and the RXDX3 is at 160334. Is 172154 a valid

	As long as it doesn't conflict with anything else on the system it's
	valid ;-)   The system came with the RQDX3 and I worked with the RD54
	for a while before adding the UC08 - when I added the UC08 I just picked
	the next free CSR which happened to be 172154.

	It probably doesn't hurt anything but I would leave off the '/'

> .ra(1,0,0) err op=89 sts=3
> .ra(1,0,0) !online

	op=89 is the "ONLINE" command and a status of 3 means the unit didn't
	go 'online'.   That is very strange since 'boot' was obviously loaded
	from the drive/controller.

	What I am wondering now is:  does the boot monitor pass 0 or 8 thru
	as the unit number?   If it's expecting 8 or 9 then that might be
	the problem because boot and the 2.11 kernel only deal with 0 thru 7

	Ok, that looks encouraging.

	Same as before - the "online" command is failing for reason(s)
	unknown as yet.

> I agree that it is pretty simple as you describe it and it is what I expected,

	I boot from the second controller all the time.  If I weren't so
	lazy (and the BA23 so narrow and hard to work in ;)) I'd have swapped
	the UC08 and RQDX3 around a long time ago.   As it is now I have to
	hit ^C during the POST and at the BOOT> prompt I enter "172154 DU 0"
	to boot from the second controller.

> for unit 0? Now that I think about it, it may be the boot firmware that is 

	Yes, if given a choice (and I don't know how this is done) all the
	controllers need to start from 0.   If the "base unit" of a controller
	is 8 then I think the problem is that the controller is expecting
	values such as 8, 9, etc in the 'mscp_unit' part of the MSCP packet.
	That would explain the failure to "online unit 0" - the controller
	is expecting to be told "online unit 8".

> controller's first disk, but I can from the second. So, I should set all the 
> controller unit numbers to 0.  The restriction is that the boot device

	Yes.   I think the 'restriction' in this case is 2.11 - it doesn't
	know how to deal with units other than 0 thru 7.

	Quite welcome!   The boot monitor can load anything, but once 'boot'
	(or the kernel) is loaded they do not know how to deal with unit=8.

I think that was what I was trying to say, but you said it better.

Hi.

A friendly user pointed me to this obvious error:

(part of a typescript, an FTP session to my PDP, running 2.11BSD)

ncftp /usr/home/martijnb> ls -la foobar.c
-rw-r--r--  1 martijnb users         106 Jan 15 15:25 foobar.c
ncftp /usr/home/martijnb> quote mdtm foobar.c
191010115144152

(mdtm should return the datestamp, in the form yyyymmddhhmm. ftpd
thinks that it is 19101, and chops off the last digit of the filedate..)

Things go wrong when you try to get an allready existing file:

ncftp /usr/home/martijnb > get foobar.c

The local file "foobar.c" already exists.
	Local:           133 bytes, dated Mon Feb  5 13:25:59 2001.
	Remote:          133 bytes, dated Thu Oct 13 04:44:15 1910.

	[O]verwrite?  [A]ppend to?  [S]kip?  [N]ew Name?  > 

Hmm.

I'll see if I can figure out a quick patch :)

Yep, that's a sure sign, which (cough, cough) I have personally seen on
some (cough, cough) Y2K-compliant software supported by (cough, cough)
A Large Software Company.  No, I wasn't personally responsible for that
code :-)

> I'll see if I can figure out a quick patch :)

Beware of the Y2K.1 bug :-(

Synopsis:

In order to overcome the Y2K bug, we implement a quick fix, because we
are too lazy to do it properly:

IF last two digits == '00' THEN make first two digits == '20'.
// Because we're gonna retire this stuff after 2000.

So what happens in 2001?  Well, you get 1901, 19101, etc.  Sigh...  Isn't
that fix what got us into trouble in the first place?

Disclaimer: None of Geac software exhibited the Y2K.1 bug, since we tested
it thoroughly, for years 2000, 2001, etc: I make no comment on Y2K.

Miraculously, this *reduces* the size of the binary by a whopping two

Dear All,
IIRC the start of this thread stated that this was on a 2.11 system.  If this
was so has anyone submitted the patch to Steve Schultz for consideration as a
formal update?

Appologies if this has already been done.

Robin

	Don't worry - I saw the thread.   Consider the patch submitted :)

	I did find it fascinating that the bug slipped thru since at one time
	a (obviously not detailed enough) scan of the system for 'tm_year'
	references was done.

	Thanks!
