Strictly speaking Unix wasn't born on Thu Jan 1 UTC 1970, right?
dmr says this in "The Evolution of the Unix Time-Sharing Sytem":

  Although it was not until well into 1970 that Brian
  Kernighan suggested the name `Unix,' in a somewhat
  treacherous pun on `Multics,' the operating system we know
  today was born.

I wonder if how many unix programmers were born on Thu Jan 1
UTC 1970.  Linus comes close.
