All,
I just received this from Sebastien Loisel. I don't have any recent
SysV sources, but I though I'd pass this on to the mailing list in
case anybody else can help Sebastien.

Hello,

I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm interested in the current Unix debacle. 
I'm diffing linux kernel sources against Unix sources, and I've written 
a program to do that efficiently, but I'm afraid that what Unix sources 
I can locate aren't actually relevant (I've been using what I can find 
at minnie.tuhs.org...)

I know that a lot of people have the correct sources and that they were 
even available for download on the web, so I was wondering if you could 
hook me up somehow?

I'm a researcher at McGill university in Montreal 
(http://www.math.mcgill.ca/loisel/) and I would only be using that 
source code for research. I intend to diff the files and then provide a 
list of similar files, and I hope to quote the common portions (assuming 
they are short enough for "fair use.")

If you can't help me, can you tell me someone who could?

Thank you very much,

Sebastien Loisel
