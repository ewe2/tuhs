I sort of agree.  The macro-ed ALGOL like syntax that Steve did was hard
to deal with if you weren't on the ALGOL train (I was not, too young).
So the C version was easier for me to understand.  But it sort of
lost something, I didn't really understand Steve's version, not at any
deep level.  But it made more sense, somehow, than the C version did.
