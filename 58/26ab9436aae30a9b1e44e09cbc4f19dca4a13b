Thanks, Noel,

I think I understand- the bytes that we have on hand are not device faithful representations, but rather are failthful representations of what is presented to the OS. That is, back in the day, a tape would be stored in various formats as would disks, but unix would show these devices as streams of bytes, and those are the streams of bytes are what have been preserved. 

Some formats have header info, file lists, and such placed in predetermined locations, and some have different block sizes, file/tape marks, but no track, sector type or device specific info is retained? Does this sound reasonably accurate?
