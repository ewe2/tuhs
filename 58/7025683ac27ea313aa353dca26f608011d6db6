Many thanks!

4.1a BSD appears within reach, it is "Network Unix" that I am still looking for:

I'm looking for the source code to "Network Unix" as described here:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc681
and/or its later development described here:
https://archive.org/details/networkunixsyste243kell

Actually, I'd be happy with finding the source code to any version of this Network Unix.

There is also a 1975 paper by Chesson about it (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806522), I can send you that if it helps.
