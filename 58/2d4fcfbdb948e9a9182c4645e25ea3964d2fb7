Another one I noted a while ago was that functions and command in Unix, 
such as lpq, which try to print things in nice columns now fail, because 
the code don't actually know how many characters have been output.

And let's not even talk about such wonderful concepts as colors in the 
character set definition... Unicode seems to have it all... I wonder how 
many code points exist for 'A'. It's definitely more than one...
