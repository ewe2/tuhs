Just wondering who actually designed the AT&T UNIX package utility. I have
to admit the documentation of this utility is rather sparse in term of
examples of scripting problems and handling the I/O. Did internal AT&T
documentation have any more information or did it merely consist of the
source? I'm interested in creating patches and dependencies between
packages. Any information or insight would be welcome.

Regards.
