Absolutely true.  And hoping that, different to web browsers, no

diversity instead of anything else.

If there is the freedom for a decision.  That is how it goes, yes.
For example one may have renamed "The Ethiopian Jewish Exodus --
Narratives of the Migration Journey to Israel 1977 - 1985" to
"Falasha" in order to use the book as an email attachment.  Which
would be pretty disappointing.  But it is also nice to see that
there are standards which were not fully thought through and
required backward incompatible hacks to fill the gaps.  Others
like DNS are pretty perfect and scale fantastic.  Thus.

Ah, it has become a real pain.  It is ever so astounding how much
HTML5 specifics, scripting and third party analytics can be
involved for a page that would have looked better twenty years
ago, or say whenever CSS 2.0 came around.  Today almost each and
every commercial site i visit is in practice a denial of service
attack.  For me and my little box at least, and without gaining
any benefit from that!

The thing is, i do not want be lied to, but what those boxes you
refer to say are often plain lies.  It has nothing to do with my
security, or performance boosts, or whatever ... maximally so in
a juristically unobjectionable way.  Very disappointing.

It is just me and my desire to drive this old thing forward so
that it finally will be usable for something real.  Or what i deem
for that.  I actually have no idea of nmh, but i for one think the
sentence of the old BSD Mail manual stating it is an "intelligent
mail processing system, which has a command syntax reminiscent of
ed(1) with lines replaced by messages" has always been a bit
excessive.  And the fork i maintain additionally said it "is also
usable as a mail batch language, both for sending and receiving
mail", adding onto that.

 |You can keep the brain implant.  I have a desire to not have one.

Me too, me too.  Oh, me too.  Unforgotten those american black and
white films with all those sneaky alien attacks, and i was
a teenager when i saw them.  Yeah, but in respect to that i am
afraid the real rabble behind the real implants will be even
worse, and drive General Motors or something. ^.^  I have no
idea..  No, but.. i really do not think future humans will get
around that, just imagine automatic 911 / 112, biologic anomaly
detection, and then you do not need to learn latin vocabulary but
can buy the entire set for 99.95$, and have time for learning
something real important.  For example.
It is all right, just be careful and ensure that not all police
men go to the tourist agency to book a holiday in Texas at the
very same time.  I think this is manageable.

You say it.  In the research Unix nupas mail (as i know it from
Plan9) all those things could have been done with a shell script
and standard tools like grep(1) and such.  Even Thunderbird would
simply be a maybe even little nice graphical application for
display purposes.  The actual understanding of storage format and
email standards would lie solely within the provider of the file
system.  Now you use several programs which all ship with all the
knowledge.  I for one just want my thing to be easy and reliable
controllable via a shell script.  You could replace procmail
(which is i think perl and needs quite some perl modules) with
a monolithic possibly statically linked C program.  Then.  With
full error checking etc.  This is a long road ahead, for my thing.

 |How does my use of DMARC irritate the list-reply mechanism of your MUA?

So ok, it does not, actually.  It chooses your "Grant Taylor via
TUHS" which ships with the TUHS address, so one may even see this
as an improvement to DMARC-less list replies, which would go to
TUHS, with or without the "The Unix Heritage Society".
I am maybe irritated by the 'dkim=fail reason="signature
verification failed"' your messages produce.  It would not be good
to filter out failing DKIMs, at least on TUHS.

 |DMARC is completely transparent to message contents.  Sure, DKIM adds 
 |headers with a signature.  But I don't see anything about DKIM's use 
 |that has any impact on how any MUA handles a message.
 |
 |Or are you referring to the fact that some mailing lists modify the 
 |From: header to be DMARC compliant?

Ach, it has been said without much thought.  Maybe yes.  There is
a Reply-To: of yours.

 |Please elaborate on what you mean by "DMARC irritate the list-reply 
 |mechanism of your MUA".

My evil subconsciousness maybe does not like the MARC and DKIM
standards.  That could be it.  I do not know anything better,
maybe the next OpenPGP and S/MIME standards will include
a checksum of some headers in signed-only data, will specify that
some headers have to be repeated in the MIME part and extend the
data to-be-verified to those, whatever.  I have not read the
OpenPGP draft nor anyting S/MIMEish after RFC 5751.

A nice sunday i wish.
