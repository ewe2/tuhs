Check Paul Cantrell's VTECO - Video Teco Manual
<http://www.copters.com/teco.html> where has the sources here Video Teco
Sourceforge Masters <http://videoteco.sourceforge.net/>

Ward had a nice history here:  TecoEditor
<http://c2.com/wiki/remodel/?TecoEditor> - worth reading - there are some
wonderful quotes.   BTW I agree with Ward, while Ed Post was mostly right
in his "real Programmer' don't use Pascal" tome (also a classic read), but
real TECO users do know what typing their name will do ;-)

Some of us can recall when the _only_ choices for editing on UNIX (on the<b=

<br>
from the Delphi system at MIT (which preceded adoption of UNIX there) - a<b=

<br>
since it&#39;s all in lower case, and doesn&#39;t have other DEC stylisms),=
 after the<br>
port, added a &#39;^R mode&#39; similar to the one added to the PDP-10 ITS =
TECO and<br>
used there to write EMACS (in TECO&#39;s usual &#39;line noise&#39; code - =

which could<br>
