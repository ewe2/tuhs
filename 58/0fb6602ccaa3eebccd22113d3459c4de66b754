Hi


Personally, I'm very grateful for the amount of time you've spent not simpl=
y finding and posting the things you do (this, cmu mach, the BSD and Unix s=
tuff) but also the blog entries you write that spell out the steps you take=
 to get it all running.=20


As someone who came along much later (slackware 3.5?, freebsd 2.2-something=
) but has a lot of interest/curiosity about what the older days were like i=
t's very helpful and illuminating.=20


Oh! ...and of course, Happy Birthday 386BSD!
