I’d be interested in anything on Spider/Datakit networking in V4-V7.
(at them moment the trail starts at V8, with just a few hints in earlier
source materials, and the bits that Noel found).

My thinking is that there were two main lines of early networking development
on Unix (and I realise that this gross simplification excludes many other
worthy projects):

1. The “sockets” lineage from UoI NCP Unix -> BBN NCP Unix -> BBN TCP Unix
    -> 4.1a BSD -> 4.2 BSD

2. The “device” lineage from Spider -> Datakit -> UUCP -> streams
   -> STREAMS

In the first lineage there is much material available, in the second very
little. This is probably because Datakit was AT&T confidential at the time.
