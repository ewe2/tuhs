Don't forget probably every ISP under the sun.

My first Internet account in 1995 (or possibly 1996) came with *nix
shell access (please don't ask me what variant; I used it mostly to
run pine, and occasionally pico, and it was dial-up which was charged
per minute by the phone company) and a 4 MB quota, which you could pay
to have increased. That quota covered everything in your $HOME; as I
recall, including e-mail, and definitely including ~/public_html.

These days, it seems that with the exception of _really_ cheap
accounts, web host quotas are big enough that they for all intents and
purposes might as well not be there, even with today's bloated
content. Back then, even 4 MB for everything felt on the tight side,
and you certainly had to think about what you put there.
