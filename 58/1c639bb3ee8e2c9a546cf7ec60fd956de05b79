I always used the design principle "Write locally, read over NFS".  This
obviated locking issues and fit in with the idea of fate-sharing: a write
would always succeed, even if reading would have to wait until R (the
machine doing the reading) was up.  The only additional thing I needed was
the ability for W (the machine doing the writing) to notify R that
something had changed, which I did by having R run a process that listened
on a port that would be opened and then closed by W: no data flowed over
this connection.  If this connection could not be made, the process on the
W side would loop in bounded exponential backoff.
