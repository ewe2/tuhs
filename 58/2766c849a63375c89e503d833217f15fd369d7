I agree. For topicality, I think it's reasonable to draw the line
somewhere similar to what's already the case with the "true" unixes,
if I'm allowed to use such a designation. As a rule of thumb,
something along the lines of: if it's got a historical application
(say, "how do I get UUCP running on this Linux installation designed
to replicate a 1992 system?") then it's on topic; if it's solely about
modern systems ("how do I get Wayland running with my Nvidia GeForce
RTX 2060 Super?") then it's off topic.

So, really, no significant change there.
