I think it would be cool, but we need better data visualization. There's a
lot of rich history here that people like me try to boil down to a few
ovals and arrows, but the real answer is much more complicated. We need the
equivalent to Mindard's analysis of Napoleon's march to Moscow and back to
show how things like awk entered, and where, and different 'sub editions'
and different lines of code maintained outside the overly simple narrative
of V1 -> V2 ... -> V7 -> 32V -> chaos. :)

I'd be keen to write up what I've found.

If they are large enough, I could be persuaded to reprise my EuroBSDcon
talk at them, assuming people are happy with how it turns out....
