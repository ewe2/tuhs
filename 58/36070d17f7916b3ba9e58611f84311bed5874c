Yes, and that's the point I was (trying to) make: snapshots are only
immune to ransomware as long as (a) said ransomware isn't running as
root, and (b) said ransomware can't escalate to having root access (or
whatever capabilities might be required to poke around ZFS snapshots),
and of course (c) said ransomware doesn't know about ZFS snapshots.

Snapshots definitely raise the bar, which is a good thing, not to
mention how useful they are for bona fide "oh carp" moments. I do
however feel that "immune" is a bit too strong a word.

I'm pretty sure at least ZoL for Debian comes packages with a sudoers
file where all you need to do to allow read-only ZFS sudo access to
normal users is uncomment one or a few lines. It's been a while since
I set it up.
