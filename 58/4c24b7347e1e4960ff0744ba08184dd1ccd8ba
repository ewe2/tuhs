I'm the opposite.  Would have double-majored in EE and CS but my school
wouldn't allow double majoring unless you stayed for 9 semesters.  I
finished my EE in 7 semesters and was 2 classes shy of the CS degree
and couldn't justify another year just for 2 classes.  In hindsight
I'm not sure that that was the correct choice because I would have
partied my ass off.
