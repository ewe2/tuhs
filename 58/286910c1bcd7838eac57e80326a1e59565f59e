AT&T Summit had library called something like the Toolbox. A number of
assorted tools like some PS support, the  korn shell (ksh88), mk and think
the some of the  5620 tools like layers where able to be purchased from it.
  It was all source.

What I don=E2=80=99t remember how many of the 5620 games were in that kit (=
or much
of anything else in it).
