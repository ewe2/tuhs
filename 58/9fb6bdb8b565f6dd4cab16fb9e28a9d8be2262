In my experience 9 track tapes were not guaranteed to be readable after some=
 interval. In fact, a standard operations procedure was to copy important ta=
pes to new media periodically.=20

I distinctly remember a rather catastrophic error in the AT&T Worldnet ISP m=
ail system. It was running a third party email server product on a large clu=
ster of big Sun boxes. A new release was installed. It had bugs and curdled a=
ll of the customers=E2=80=99 data. It got backed out and a huge restore from=
 backup effort began, only to find that a bunch of recently written tapes we=
re unreadable.  Needless to say, we had unhappy customers and, if I remember=
 correctly, some very negative press in the WSJ and the NY Times.=20
