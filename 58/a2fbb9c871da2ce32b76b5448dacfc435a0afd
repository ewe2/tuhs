Unless you have a Shaffstall 6000 -- a really cool piece of equipment once
made by my current employer, which is basically a box full of floppy
drives (3.5" HD, 5.25" 48tpi, 5.25" 96tpi, 8", and a few, but not mine,
have the Amstrad 3" 'flippy-disk') which are all _really_ well-aligned
(20% better than OEM spec) and an intelligent disk controller (which is
actually an 8085-based SBC) in a PC. About the only disks I _can't_ read
(or write or format) with this thing are the 2.88MB 3.5"
'extended-density' disks -- and I have a NeXTstation to read those.
Needless to say, I've got no problem formatting RX50s, in any interleave.

Still haven't tried it. Had to watch the Pacers game and get some needed
sleep.

I've gone over ra.c several times -- that's a fun piece of code. I've
written device drivers before, but really, was this a test of DEC
software engineers by DEC hardware engineers?

Well, all my serial cables are three-wire (yes, I'm lazy, but I get
1.8K/sec via SLIP at 19200, so I'm not too concerned), but the 'numerous
other goodies' I like.

As for the userland environment, it's "vanilla BSD" and that's exactly
what I know and love. Give me 2.11BSD on a PDP over Solaris on an
UltraSPARC any day (well, if anyone wants to _give me_ and UltraSPARC,
I'll do the responsible thing and reevaluate my claims -- and SunOS [4.1.x
that is] is a decent OS, but anyway, I digress). The only thing I want is
command history and filename completion in the Bourne shell (having grown
used to Bash -- although it's a big memory pig and I admit I use it only
for the previously mentioned features, though I like the PS variable magic
characters, too -- I'm thinking about trying to hack the CH features of
tcsh (never been a C shell fan) into sh, maybe we should start a 2BSD
'ports' collection? Any suggestions for a name of this shell? Any
suggestions for freeing up my time to write it :)?

Also, when I get my RX50 toolset for FreeBSD working, should I put it in
the archive? It'd probably be more interesting to PUPS'ers than the
FreeBSD community At Large.

Thanks for reminding me about the Jack Dennis article -- I had
forgotten about that one.

There were, I think, at least *four* time-sharing systems for the
PDP-1.  Besides the MIT and BBN ones, there was also the Hospital
Computer Project (I'm not sure whether that one was descended from
the early BBN system or was written from scratch) and the THOR
system at Stanford.  I can't give proper citations because I'm
currently 2000 miles from my book collection.

I thought there was a port of an early tcsh to 2.*BSD? Maybe I have poor
memory. Anyway, I believe that Minix has a very tiny editline(), which
could be squeezed into the 2.11BSD csh to give you command-line editing.

If nothing else, the "more" program began as a copy of an ITS feature.
And people think of emacs as a Unix program, but it came to Unix from
ITS and brought with it things like the "info" documentation format.

ITS was quite idiosyncratic, and I do not recall that Richie or Thompson
ever mentioned it as an influence on Unix. But you can judge for
yourself, if you want.

The ITS Reference manual is available at

The source code and system documentation for ITS has been released under

Thanks to the good advice of members of the PUPS mailing list, I've
completed my first stab at an RX50 read/write toolset for FreeBSD. It
consists of two parts, a kernel patch to add the physical format, and a
filter set to deal with the logical sector interleave. It's ugly (not only
does it only support stdin and stdout, but it uses both 'goto' and the
ternary operator; I tend to deeply offend the C style gods, late at
night when I think nobody's watching), but it seems to work pretty
well. The kernel patch, at least, is clean. Those with good karma and
flawlessly aligned drive heads can even try formatting their own RX50s.

So how do I submit it to the archive? "incoming" seems to be RO. It's
about 3K, tarred and gzipped.

Yup. There's a tcsh included in 2.11BSD; thing is, I'm partial to the
Bourne shell. Hence, a project.

Well, it's kind of ugly (okay, really ugly), but it's working pretty well.
The physical I/O portion is a (miniscule) patch against the 4.0-STABLE
FreeBSD kernel, but the interleave filters are pretty much standard C
(hideous C, but no BSD tricks) and should work on any raw I/O read of an
RX50 disk (you can do it in Linux without kernel mods; see setfdprm(8)).
Of course, the filters are only applicable to PDP-11-ish or VAX-ish RX50s;
Rainbow and DECmate disks are totally different; if someone wants to
implement those things, go ahead (Rainbow MS-DOS could be had with careful
mods to mtools, and there are a billion ways to skin a CP/M disk;  
haven't seen anything on UNIX to handle the DEC WPS file management
system, but I digress), but they have little to do with UNIX on the PDP
and less to do with me personally (my loving father having discarded my
DECmate II as junk about ten years ago).

Then call your nearest DEC dealer, get a quote on the replacement price, and

Could be worse. I deeply offend the C style gods right in the open where
everyone can see. Since I'm pretty much a hardware type, I do _everything_
in state machines. While that works great for everything from hardware to
Prolog, it does mean my code tends to assume the only available
control structure is "if( expr ) goto state;". My attitude is that the
state diagram is the program, the code is just an implementation detail.

I used to work for a company that did TURBOchannel devices. I did the
device drivers for all the platforms (VAX/VMS, Alpha/VMS, Ultrix, and
OSF/1) and I shipped source code (it wasn't a conscious decision on the
part of management; since I got to build the distribution kits, the source
code was included and management simply didn't argue with me). One day I
got a letter from someone who had just bought our TURBOchannel parallel
printer port offering to go through the code and remove all those evil
gotos for the low, low price of only $100 a page. I declined the offer.

Um. Let me put it this way... Userland is a *lot* smaller in 4.3 than
NetBSD... How much time do you think that makes up? The same goes for the
kernel. It's not that 4.3 is faster per se, just that it has a lot less to
build.

	Oh - ok.  I must have misread the initial posting that indicated the
	complete copy went thru

		  dd if=testrx50.img of=/dev/ra12a
		  800+0 records in
		  800+0 records out

	If the writing of the floppy bailed out after "2+0" then it is no
	wonder the compare later fails - only the first sector was written.

	Sleep I can understand :)

	I really think (and sure hope!) that write enabling the label area
	will fix the problem.

	Having to do a "disklabel -W" on a disk before doing 'raw' I/O was
	a change that came in when labels were implemented.  Before labels
	the tables were compiled into the driver and 'raw' I/O could scribble
	all over the disk and the system would still know about the 
	partitioning.   When I ported over disklabels from 4.3-Reno it seemed
	like a "Good Thing" to be paranoid about preserving the label sector ;)

	You know - I think it was a contest inside DEC to see who would go
	crazy first.   Reading the comments in the Ultrix drivers gave me
	the impression that even within DEC getting clear and correct
	documentation wasn't a given.   Then there are Chris Torek's comments
	in the 4.3-Reno and later MSCP drivers when he was in essence reverse
	engineering (or outright guessing) the MSCP commands, options, etc.

	Hmmm, that's got to be a DHQ or similar.  I had real problems with a
	DHV-11 and character loss when going over 9600.   Also, if you want
	to use "Kermit" you have to have RTS/CTS because that's a fairly
	heavy weight protocol and the system can't keep up if the rate is
	too high.   With RTS/CTS in place I was able to use 38400 and not
	loose a single character.

	Might I suggest "pig"? <grin!>

	I like and use 'csh' for everything except the basic scripts that go
	into the system.  Csh has filename completion that works fairly well,
	only thing it doesn't have is arrowkey driven command editing.

	But observe the bloat factor that comes with "niceties" such as
	command history and command editing:

	First there's the honest to Bourne shell:

	text    data    bss     dec     hex
	16576   2356    416     19348   4b94	/bin/sh

	Then take a look at /bin/csh where there's history and a nicer
	(to me scripting capability - doing arithmetic in csh is so much 
	easier than in sh):

	55744   7104    3682    66530   103e2   total text: 69120
		overlays: 7360,6016

	Overlaid!  Efficiently (the one overlay is called seldom) but overlaid
	none the less.

	And lastly 'tcsh' (and yes, there is a port of an older version of
	tcsh for 2.11):

	48960   14844   11986   75790   1280e   total text: 140864
		overlays: 15424,16000,14144,14016,16256,16064

	Zounds!  No hope of really being efficient - modules were packed where
	they would fit.   More than doubling the size of 'csh' seems to be
	a VERY high price to pay for using the arrow keys if you ask me.

	Oh, and 'tcsh' has another problem due to it's appetite for memory.
	If it runs out of D space (more likely since it's so much larger)
	you get logged out.   Doing filename completion in 'tcsh' and being
	in a directory with too many files is a sure way to be staring at
	the login prompt shortly there after ;)

Well, of course it does.  But it's also well worth keeping in mind that
while pcc is generally inferior to gcc in almost every other way, due
to its simplicity it *is* probably at least five times as fast.  A lot
of the difference in speed we're talking about here, particularly
with regard to the kernel, is due to the use of a much slower compiler;
as much of the kernel as you *have* to build for a VAX (as opposed to
what you *can* build if you *want to*) hasn't really bloated a lot
between 4.3 and NetBSD.  Runtime memory use is a somewhat different
matter, but we do still fit into Ragge's smaller VAXen pretty well.

Thanks to Michael for reminding me exactly what the situation with
the optimizer and kernel builds under 4.3 is.  Though I think he
forgot to mention "inline" (ack!  pffffft!)... :-)
