Well you had two choices.   You could telnet/rlogin in to the 370 AIX instance or use an xterm running there to direct things to your PS/2.

The other choice is to use TCF.   TCF allowed you to transparently run binaries on a remote machine and it took care of redirecting stdin/stdout back to your machine.

So ... what communications technology and protocol was used?  Serial? 
(I assume that you could have some sort of establishment controller with (a)synch serial ports.)  Or would it be some sort of red headed step child that ran across twinax / 3270 even though the 3270 terminals couldn't really support it?
