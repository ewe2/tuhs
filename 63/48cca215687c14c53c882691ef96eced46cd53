As Pete says, you can't run 2.11 on an 11/23.

However, I do run 2.9 BSD on my 11/34 as it does NOT require seperate I&D
as does 2.11 BSD.

Might want to try using 2.9 on your 11/23.  Here's the CPUs supported by
2.9 BSD:

11/23, 11/24, 11/34, 11/34A, 11/34C, 11/40, 11/44, 11/45, 11/55, 11/70

Min. required memory is 192K

Lyle
