In the translated text that I have, the hacker relied primarily on
Emacs' mail feature to move the compromised atrun into place for
execution, in order to gain temporary root privileges. It is possible
that Stoll's original English text is more specific about which exact
feature was used; the translation does leave a little to be desired in
places where it's actually noticable even without having seen the
original, so I would not hold it beyond the translator (in 1991; gosh,
that's over a quarter of a century ago now) to not be completely
familiar with the finer points of Unix editors, or possibly even
wanting to simplify a little for a _readership_ that couldn't be
expected to.
