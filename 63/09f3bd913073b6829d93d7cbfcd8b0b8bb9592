It's really in my mind the opposite of C and unix in design.    It's not very consistent.   Why does the FILE
structure go as the first argument in some functions (similar to the way UNIX tends to do things) and at the end of others?
Why on earth did they preserve the silly fread/fwrite size feature that just multiplies the two middle args together long
after it was realized that portability doesn't demand making such a distinction.   Why is there no consistency in
return values?    It's was poorly thought out as the portable I/O library (which apparently never really got ported\
anywhere) and just condified in all it's ugliness.
