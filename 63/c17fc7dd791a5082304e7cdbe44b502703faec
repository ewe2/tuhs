There are many things to dislike about sockets, but one of them -
irrelevant now, perhaps, but hugely troublesome at the time - was the way
they embedded the specific and peculiar behavior of Ethernet, such as
accepting a connection before you know if it's authorized - into the
networking interface. No other networking hardware worked like Ethernet at
either the electrical or the software level, and yet here we are.

I grump, I grump.
