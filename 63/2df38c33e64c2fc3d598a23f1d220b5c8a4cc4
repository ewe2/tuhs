Oh yes. I used them in multiple places; in fact, on a public access Unix
system that I still (!!) am active on (well, not really...grex.org) we use
them; mostly to try and limit the effects of abuse.

Quotas were very useful in time shared and network environments, where you
didn't quite trust all of the users. For example, university networks where
undergrads were given accounts for course work, but could be otherwise
mischievous, and you didn't want them interfering with research happening
on the same system/network.
