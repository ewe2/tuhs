I didn't expect to have more documents to share this soon, but I've just se=
cured a trove of early System V/5.0 documents, as listed:

System V User's Manual
System V Administrator's Manual
System V Error Message Manual
System V Transition Aids
System V Release Description

User's Guide
Operator's Guide
Administrator's Guide
Programming Guide
Graphics Guide
Support Tools Guide
Document Processing Guide

The System V-prefixed ones are very specifically labeled System V, although=
 I know at least of the User's and Administrator's Manuals with "Release 5.=
0" branding out in the wild as well.  I've got two of the User's Manuals ex=
hibiting this difference.  I believe I've seen a scan of the Admin's Manual=
 with 5.0 as well, but I would have to go searching for it, it's on bitsave=
rs perhaps?  In any case, this is the documentation series for the initial =
releases of System V, the ones with "UNIX System" in big letters with grid =
patterns fading out into the background.  I don't know if the second set is=
 considered part of the Release 5.0 or System V version of the document pac=
kage, or if they made that distinction, but as of present I can positively =
identify the first 5 as being specifically for the System V version of this=
 release.  What is particularly curious is there are documents displaying "=
System V" but with a Western Electric logo on the front.  I've seen a scan =
of a System V gold User's Manual with the logo removed and a disclaimer on =
the front page explaining that they can't use the Bell logo anymore due to =
the divestiture, likewise on bitsavers I'm pretty sure, so this may establi=
sh that there were at least three revisions: Release 5.0, System V pre-dive=
stiture, and System V post-divestiture.

Now for a little plug, just because she's been so incredibly helpful, I bou=
ght these from Leslie (last name unknown) known as "oldmaddogshop" on eBay.=
  We got chatting for a little while and her husband was a computing profes=
sor at the University of Portland for some time as it sounds, and they're c=
urrently starting to go through the decades of literature and hardware he's=
 picked up over the years for sale on eBay and perhaps other avenues.  She =
very specifically mentioned a PDP-8 that he happens to have that he's hopin=
g they can coordinate to donate to a museum or some other way to get it int=
o a relatively publicly accessible space rather than winding up in the clos=
et of a private collector.  I told her I'd drop a brief mention in letting =
folks know about the documents in case they'd want the option of perusing s=
ome of what they're going to be offloading.  She made mention of a stack of=
 USENIX manuals as well, I have a smattering of 4.2 and 4.3 manuals already=
, so someone may be lucky enough to snag those soon enough.  Up currently a=
re an early SVID and some OSF/Motif stuff, but she said they've got plenty =
of boxes of books to go through.

Anywho, once I receive these documents, I plan on starting the scanning pro=
cess much like with the UNIX/TS 4.0 stuff, and will be in touch with Warren=
 concerning hosting and a release as time goes on.  One bit of input if any=
one knows, does the above list represent (aside from Release 5.0 variants) =
the complete documentation package for System V gold?  I can't say I've com=
e across any other titles, and most certainly haven't seen PDFs of anything=
 that isn't included here, but I see plenty of titles I've never seen scann=
ed.  If nothing else, I'm hoping that "Release Description" document may ha=
ve a brief flyover of the published materials, akin to the list of books at=
 the beginning of the SVR4 manuals or the documentation roadmaps of earlier=
 UNIX/TS and PWB releases.
