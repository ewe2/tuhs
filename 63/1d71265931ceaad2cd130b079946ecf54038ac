I think the paper you both are referring to is the "What have we learned 
from the PDP-11", by Gordon Bell and Bill Strecker in 1977.

There is some additional comments in 
https://gordonbell.azurewebsites.net/Digital/Bell_Retrospective_PDP11_paper_c1998.htm

Hmm. I'm not aware of anyone perceiving the Unibus as an I/O bus. It was 
very clearly designed a the system bus for all needs by DEC, and was 
used just like that until the 11/70, which introduced a separate memory 
bus. In all previous PDP-11s, both memory and peripherals were connected 
on the Unibus.

Why it only have 18 bits, I don't know. It might have been a reflection 
back on that most things at DEC was either 12 or 18 bits at the time, 
and 12 was obviously not going to cut it. But that is pure speculation 
on my part.

But, if you read that paper again (the one from Bell), you'll see that 
he was pretty much a source for the Unibus as well, and the whole idea 
of having it for both memory and peripherals. But that do not tell us 
anything about why it got 18 bits. It also, incidentally have 18 data 
bits, but that is mostly ignored by all systems. I believe the KS-10 
made use of that, though. And maybe the PDP-15. And I suspect the same 
would be true for the address bits. But neither system was probably 
involved when the Unibus was created, but made fortuitous use of it when 
they were designed.

Quite possible. :-)

Bell in retrospect thinks that they should have realized this problem, 
but it would appear they really did not consider it at the time. Or 
maybe just didn't believe in what they predicted.
