Yes, Cromemco was the company, Cromix their unix like OS.

IIRC, in 1981-83 timeframe someone I worked with had mentioned
he used to work at Cromemco and that they had a unix like OS
called Cromix. Cromemco were in Mountain View so likely they
were at the WCCF.

Even though z80 could only address 64k, their system had a
bank select under s/w control & upto 512K of RAM could be
added.  Z80 didn't have a supervisor mode but still, the bank
select must have  afforded enouh protection from bad pointers
crashing random processes.
