I understand the preference for a bottom-up entry, with somebody already =
sympathetic.

If there is no such entry point, top-down may work at Microfocus. I =
guess the ask is for a statement for SysV similar to the Nokia statement =
for 8th-10th Edition:
=
https://media-bell-labs-com.s3.amazonaws.com/pages/20170327_1602/statement=
%20regarding%20Unix%203-7-17.pdf

According to Companies=E2=80=99 House, the general counsel is Jane =
Smithard:
=
https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/0150459=
3/officers

She appears to be 67, to have a long tenure with Microfocus and maybe is =
just the right person:
"Jane has more than 25 years=E2=80=99 experience as a lawyer in the IT =
industry and software sector. She has worked with Micro Focus for over =
20 years providing a wide range of commercial and corporate legal =
services, from leading the efforts through the 2005 IPO to driving the =
legal aspects of the group=E2=80=99s mergers, acquisitions and =
divestitures strategy including the acquisition of HPE Software and =
divestiture of SUSE. Jane leads a team of approximately 60 lawyers and =
other professionals worldwide, the majority of whom are focused directly =
on supporting the Company=E2=80=99s commercial teams and business.=E2=80=9D=

https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/about/leadership-about

Her e-mail appears to be jane (dot) smithard (at) microfocus (dot) com

But I guess that Dan Doernberg already knows all that. His book project =
sounds intriguing, by the way.
