One of the main reasons I bailed out of nmh development was the =
disinterest in trying new and offside ways of addressing the mail store =
model.  I have been an MH user since the mid-80s, and I still think it =
is more functional than any other MUA in use today (including Alpine).  =
Header voyeurs will note I'm sending this from Mail.app.  As was =
mentioned earlier in this conversation, there is no one MUA, just as =
there is no one text editing tool.  I used a half dozen MUAs on a daily =
basis, depending on my needs.

But email, as a structured subset of text, deserves its own set of =
dedicated tools.  formail and procmail are immediate examples.  As MIME =
intruded on the traditional ASCII-only UNIX mbox format, grep and =
friends became less helpful.  HTML just made it worse.

Plan9's upas/fs abstraction of the underlying mailbox helps a lot.  By =
undoing all the MIME encoding, and translating the character sets to =
UTF8, grep and friends work again.  That filesystem abstraction has so =
much more potential, too.  E.g. pushing a pgpfs layer in there to =
transparently decode PGP content.

I really wish there was a way to bind Plan9-style file servers into the =
UNIX filename space.  Matt Blaze's CFS is the closest example of this I =
have seen.  Yet even it needs superuser privs.  (Yes, there's FUSE, but =
it just re-invents the NFS interface with no added benefit.)

Meanwhile, I have been hacking on a version of nmh that uses a native =
UTF8 message store.  I.e. it undoes all the MIME encoding, and undoes =
non-UTF8 charsets.  So grep and friends work, once again.
