I use them incoherently, depending on context, time, and adherence to
something approximating to xNF for some X, normal-form. Other peoples
rules.

What I found interesting, is the divergence in strategy in managing.

strategy a: I shall show these as if they were 8 space indents. You
maybe can change this. Its columns on the screen.
strategy b: I shall, in a fit of lunacy, actually change these to
align to the 8 space indent column implications. your source is now
different
strategy c: You ran some tool like tr over these, and now, Its your
fault not mine. Good luck.

I usually wound up in strategy c but some editors of the day did
strategy b. I harbour a belief, this amongst other things, is why
patch -l was invented.

I know its heresy to contradict wiser people, but I think the number
of circumstances where space/tab actually did affect baud- or data-
rate was minimal. It was an effect more apparent and believed than
real. Sure, if you used an ASR33 the head positioning was better. That
experience set against being in a Vt52 or ADM5 world, by the time you
were in a vdu display of 80x24 I think it was gone.  I never
consciously thought about it and I used both. It wasn't very material
for the circumstances but I wasn't trying to cram source into a 2k
memory to put into a rocket or a telephone switch or anything. It's a
bit like steam-engine enthusiasts arguing about boiler tube design:
most shunters don't care.

People mostly hated me mucking around with their code. I can't blame
them. It would be horrid to live in a really nicely laid out world in
either tab or space-land and have a hooligan come and scribble over
your art with a texta.  Aside from simply coding bad answers to
problems, I do note that sending people who demanded KNF non-KNF
formatted code usually led to rapid rejection.

The US is a place where people still use fixed-width fonts and
specific spacing to file paper on the law courts, although I note
Sydney Powell didn't bother spell checking before she sent in the
incredibly weird conforming style of text. I should complain: the IETF
idnit checker is feral.
