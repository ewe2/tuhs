it's incredible,

after 3 years, it BOOTED !!!

the images, taken some minutes ago, are here:

it's INCREDIBLE

we removed the cpu boards, we looked all the chips in it ... 
eating pizza and sicilian food (you can see it in the photos),
and we re-inserted them ...

and, just for a desperate test, we tried CTRL-BOOT ...

and, THE CPU was RUNNING! so we tested all the console
cables ... that seem not working ... we found another 
cable, with a null-modem converter, so we connected an old
IBM terminal ...

and, it was incredible, we had the CONSOLE CURSOR!!! :)))

NOW,
the next step is to FIND what was faulty ... a false contact in the
board connectors ???

any other hint? :)

p.s. tonight we want to install UNIX. :D
