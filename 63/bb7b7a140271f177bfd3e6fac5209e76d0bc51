As I told Steve in private email, it's a balancing act and it is a bit of
an art.  On the one hand you have new features and a bunch of bugs that
you fixed, on the other hand you have this new bug report.  Knowing when
the right call is to ship and when the right call is to stop the train,
that's the art.  I could make an attempt at writing down how you make
that call but it would just be an attempt.  Experience will tell you how
to make that call.  I can say, mostly I shipped.  It has to be something
pretty dramatic to start the process over when you know it is going to
be a 6 month delay at minimum.
