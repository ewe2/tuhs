True.  On the IBM PC AT I mentioned earlier, I needed a number of binary
file formats, as it was clear that ASCII-binary conversion was too slow
for the purpose.  (Probably not true even then, but what did I know?)
So I duly assigned 16-bit magic numbers for each file format, and
#define'd them in the code.  Where did the magic come from?  They were
RAD50 encodings of three-letter file codes!

Yes, I think that's what I was half-remembering.
