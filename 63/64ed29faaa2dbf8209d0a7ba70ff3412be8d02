I...have never been all that impressed with Salus's work.  It's not _bad_
but it's also not terribly insightful.

I'm not volunteering to do better, though.  At least not until after I find
out whose job it is to be the NOAO/NCOA archivist, shout and scream until
that answer is at least "someone," and get people poking and prodding the
first-generation LSST crowd for memoirs and interviews in that golden
period after they retire and no longer have careers to worry about, and
before they die.

Maybe for the seventy-fifth anniversary.
