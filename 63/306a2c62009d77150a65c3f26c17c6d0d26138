We were Interactive Systems users in 1981 when I worked for Martin
Marietta.   Heinz, you were working there at that point, right?   I
remember my rep was Monica Gallegos.

A few years later I got caught up with a Multibus II port which I think
Interactive Systems was also involved with.   I had three systems on my
desk to get the experimental computer with the experimental SCSI host
adapter and the experimental SCSI tape drive:   A Wyse PC, a Intel
Multibus I 386 system, and an Intel MultibusII system.

I really did end up liking MultibusII for UNIX.
