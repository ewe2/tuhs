It was not until the Thoth rewrite that became QNX that they tried to =

IIRC Gordon Bell and Dan Dodge worked with Thoth as students but QNX is =

so[1]. Back then it fit in 8KB. IIRC the original few versions were =
mostly written in assembly language or had substantial portions in =
assembly while most of Thoth was written in C[2]. The original QNX was =
basically a message passing microkernel. Unix APIs came in much later.

[1] I had to debug some obscure problem where the QNX was running on a =
text to speech board plugged in a PC and was connected to an IBM 370 =
system. The TTS system was used to allow a salesperson to place an order =
or something. It failed randomly. In the end it turned out to be an =
"undocumented" h/w bug in 286 (Intel knew about it but they denied when =
we asked!). I caught it in the act using a logic analyzer! Anyway, I had =
to get pretty familiar with QNX then.

[2] In 1981 AMD tried to get into computer business via AMC (American =
Micro Computers). They  used Thoth! I interviewed there but in the end =
joined Fortune Systems.=
