The FreeBSD 1.x CVS tree shows that it started from NET/2 with the
patchkit added on. It didn't start from the NetBSD tree that I've been
able to find (and I've studied the early CVS history for the git migration
extensively). And oral history from many of the founders who were
also patchkit contributors also matches this recounting... Though I
guess a lot turns on whether you consider the patchkit early NetBSD
or not...

I do agree with the rest of this, though.

OpenBSD forked from NetBSD after Theo had a personality dispute with
the NetBSD folks. It had little to do with the FreeBSD lists judging from
his email at the time and my early interactions with that project.
