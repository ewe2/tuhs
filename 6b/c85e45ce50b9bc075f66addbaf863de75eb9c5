Not only that, but I note that my Mac does not have a visible 
disk-activity indicator; not surprising, really, as it seems to be 
thrashing like hell whenever I have the temerity to focus (i.e. click) 
upon another window.

Now, my Mac's system disk is external (don't ask), and it has a barely 
visible blue LED, which is why I know when it thrashes sometimes.  I 
intend to throw together a photo-transistor and a high-efficiency LED 
(plus a 9v battery) for a more visible "Danger!  Will Robinson!" alert.
