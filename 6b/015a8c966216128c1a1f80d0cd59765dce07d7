I recently found out that vim.org of all places had a copy of GCC 0.9, which was the first public version, to support the VAX & 68020 SUN platforms of the time.

http://ftp.vim.org/languages/gcc/old-releases/gcc-1/

I built it on SIMH + 4.2BSD VAX along with the ‘gnu1988’ along with other gems like bison 1.00, flex 1.0 .. and it was a lot more unstable than I was expecting, the next oldest version is 1.21 which adds more platforms, and some much needed stability.  I know it’s old, but it’s funny how pro SUN they were at the time.

There's a fair amount of stuff on ftp.gnu.org itself.  The FSF
used to make tapes and CDs; perhaps they still have some laying around?

I'm not sure who to ask there, though, although I could try to find
someone.
