I asked Per Brinch Hansen recently about Solo and Concurrent Pascal, for use 
on the PDP 11 simulators, et al, and I received a reply today.

This is it.  I am wondering, does anyone have any clue as to where these 
copies of the system might be squirrelled away?  How many might've seen it at 
their Universities?

On May 4, you wrote:

  What I was wondering is, would it be worth asking you about
  the possibility of your releasing the Concurrent Pascal, Solo
  OS and several other such computer tools and programs, to PUPS
  (the PDP Unix Preservation Society)?

At Caltech we prepared a distribution tape for the PDP 11/45
with the source text and portable code of the Solo system,
including the Concurrent and Sequential Pascal compiler. The
system reports were supplemented by implementation notes.

By the spring of 1976 we had distributed the system to 75
companies and 100 universities in 21 countries. Later, other
people moved the system to the Interdata 8/32, NCR 8250,
Modular 1, LSI 11, IBM 370/145 and many other computers.

Sad to say, I no longer have a copy of the system (and I
don't know who does).
