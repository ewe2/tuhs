It's a pointer.

 

Ø   Of course it is! But that doesn't mean that it SHOULD be, which is the point.

 

Actually, it is **Not a pointer**, it gets passed as a pointer, but it is an array on both ends.

 

 

The implicit conversion of the array name to a pointer to its first item is a different issue.   This bothers me less, but it’s still hokie in my opinion.
