Noel,




*Mini-Unix has removed 'raw' devices (not sure why, probably seemed
un-needed),so other disk drivers (e.g. the RL11 driver) aren't straight
drop-ins. Minimaltweaks needed, though; just remove the read and write
routines, I think.*

Your great work to port Mini-Unix will create some demand for device
drivers on the /03 systems, so may be worthwhile to implement RAW device.

Paul
