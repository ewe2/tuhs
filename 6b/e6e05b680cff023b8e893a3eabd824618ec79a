There were several, starting I guess in the 80s mostly.  The one I remember
in particular was "Unix Review", but there were a few "journal" type
magazines that also specialized in Unix-y things (e.g., ";login:" from
USENIX; still published, I believe), and several associated with particular
vendors: "SunExpert" was one, if I recall correctly.

Occasionally, Unix and related things showed up in the "mainstream"
consumer computer press of the time.  I can remember in particular an issue
of "PC Magazine" (I think June of 1993) that ran a lengthy couple of
articles proving machines from Sun and SGI, in addition to version of Unix
that ran on PCs (interestingly, Linux was omitted despite really starting
to capture a lot of the imagination in that space; similarly I don't recall
any mention of BSD).

Some of these old magazines are definitely blasts from the past.
