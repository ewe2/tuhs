Hello,

I'm interested in acquring an AT&T 3b2 computer.  One of these systems
used to run a famous public UNIX system "killer".  They also run #5ess
telephone switches, however the OS is different in that case
(DMERT/UNIX-RTR instead of whatever the consumer-level 3b2 runs).  

If anyone has information on where to acquire these (I saw the recent
discussion on 3b1s and I know they are more prolific than 3b2s-- infact
a friend of mine used to have a UNIX PC which we set up a BBS on).

Thanks.
