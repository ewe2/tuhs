The Convergent Tech MiniFrame had a similar bug with the QIC tape drive. 
If you sent it an interrupt during a rewind (e.g. ^C a cpio after the 
extract was done, but before the rewind/close finished), it would block 
the tape device from any further use.

That was my first expedition into non-API UNIX kernel hacking, writing a 
program that would reach into the kernel to clear the 'busy' bit on the 
tape device.
