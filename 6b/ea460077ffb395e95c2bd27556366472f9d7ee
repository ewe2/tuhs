Sure, it's all in the archive. I'm now locked at home by the snow and can't
access the DVD I had created with the expanded sources of TUHS, but it is
certainly there.

I would look into either Ultrix, SystemIII or any PWB release.

Quick check: look into

	.../PDP11/Distributions/dec/Ultrix-3.1-src/ultrix11-src.tar.gz
	.../VAX/Distributions/Ultrix-32M/old-ultrix-32.tar.gz
