OK, I'll kick it off.

A beauty in V6 (and possibly V7) was discovered by the kiddies in Elec 
Eng; by sending a signal with an appropriately-crafted negative value (as 
determined from inspecting <user.h>) you could overwrite u.u_uid with 
zero...  Needless to say I scrambled to fix that one on my 11/40 network!
