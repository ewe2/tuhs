Interactive Systems.   Now there=E2=80=99s a name I=E2=80=99ve not heard =
in many a year.  Heinz Lycklama went there.

The did a couple of things, a straight UNIX port to various things =
(PDP-11, 386) and also there =E2=80=9CUNIX running under VMS=E2=80=9D =
product.

They also had their own version of the Rand Editor called =
=E2=80=9CINed=E2=80=9D that was happiest on this hacked version of a =
Perkin Elmer terminal.

Early versions were PWB UNIX based if I recall.


My first job out of college was working with IS Unix on an 11/70 playing =
configuration management (essentially all the PWB stuff).   I also =
hacked the line printer spooler and the .mm macro package to do =
classification markings (this was a part of a government contract).

=20

A few years later I was given the job of porting Interactive Systems =
UNIX that was already running on an i386 (an Intel 310 system which had =
a Multibus I) to an Intel Multibus II box.    Intel had already ported =
it once, but nobody seemed to be able to find the source code.    So =
with a fresh set of the source code for the old system from IS, I =
proceeded to reverse engineer/port the code to the Message Passing =
Coprocessor.   (Intel was not real forthcoming for documentation for =
that either).   Eventually, I got it to work (the Multibus II really was =
a pleasant bus and worked well with UNIX).   I went on to write drivers =
for a 9-track tape drive (which sat in my living room for a long time), =
a Matrox multibus II framebuffer (OK, that had problems), and a SCSI =
host adapter that was talking to this kludge device that captured =
digital data from a FLIR on uMatic cassettes (but that=E2=80=99s a =
different story).
