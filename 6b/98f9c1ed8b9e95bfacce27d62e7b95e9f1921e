Hello list,

hopefully this is not OFF-Topic too far ... but I wonder when the step from
16bit to 32bit was made in BSD. As far as I can see 2BSD is 16bit whereas
the succesor(s) is 32bit already. Was 2BSD only running on the PDP-11, or
was it ported to other architectures as well? What architecture were the
32bit versions developed on in the beginning?

Thanks in advance

Mario Premke
