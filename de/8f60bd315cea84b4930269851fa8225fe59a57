Even the last maintainer advises against using it:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procmail

``Procmail is stable, but no longer maintained.[1] Users who wish to use a
   maintained program are advised by procmail's author, Philip Guenther,[2]
   to use an alternative tool.''

``Procmail was an early example of a mail filtering tool and language.
   Procmail is no longer maintained and has unfixed security
   vulnerabilities. Procmail's last maintainers suggest using alternative
   tools.''

Given FreeBSD's philosophy re: dead ports, I guess it will be removed
soon.

With a mailserver facing the Internet, the last thing I need are security
vulnerabilities...
