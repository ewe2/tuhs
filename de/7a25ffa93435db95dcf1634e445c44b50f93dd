I would say that since the copyrights on the Santa Cruz Operation Unixware 
2.1.3 man pages are Novell's, that Novell actually has the copyrights.  Doing 
man pages seems to be the role of the source code maintainer.  Ergo, they 
didn't sell the copyrights, they sold a business opportunity.

groklaw.net has most of the info and analysis.
