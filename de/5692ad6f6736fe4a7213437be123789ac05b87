I used WordStar a lot on my old Microbee (an Aussie CP/M box) but I never

heard of WordMaster...

Getting a full ANSI C compiler for CP/M was great; I could use some Unix

tools on it :-)  Can't remember if it was BDS or Hi-Tech; one was ANSI=20
(function prototypes and the works) whereas the other wouldn't even=20
recognise things like "int i =3D 1;".

I even found a UUCP for it too, but it was overlaid to hell and back; at

least it worked...
