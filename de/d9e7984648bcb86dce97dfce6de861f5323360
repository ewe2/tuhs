Yes. The forks might not have been bad, and there's always some
logical fallacy presented to say they are somehow the "same" because
of some artificial criteria.

And I'm not convinced all the forks are bad, per se. Just that the narrative
that says there's only one is false and misleading in some ways because
there always was a diversity of 'add in' patches for different
distributions,
both commercial and hobbyist... Much, but by no means all, of that wound
up upstream, though not always the best and the reasons for rejection
could be arbitrary at times, or just made too hard to bother trying to
upstream
at others. There was something in the diversity, though, that I'll readily
admit was beneficial.

I suffered through MontaVista Linux which definitely wasn't ABI compatible.
And all of their board support packages were based on different versions
of Linux, making it a nightmare to support lots of architectures...

CSRG's funding dried up when the DARPA work was over. And even before
it was over, CSRG was more an academic group than one who had a desire
to impose its will on commercial groups that it had no leverage over.

And AT&T had become all about monetization of unix, which meant it imposed
new terms that were unfavorable, making it harder for old-time licensees to
justify pulling in the new code that would have kept the world from
Balkanizing
as badly as it did. So there were complex issues at play here as well.

Except FreeBSD's PAO project had PCMCIA support about two years
before NetBSD did, and hot plug worked on it too.. So that's a bit of an
apples to oranges comparison. To be fair, the main FreeBSD project
was slow to take up changes from PAO and that set back PC Card
and CardBus support a number of years.

At the time, though, FreeBSD ran on the busiest FTP server on the
internet could handle quite a bit more load than an equivalent Linux
box at the time. And NetBSD was much more in the "no code before
its time" camp than FreeBSD, which tried to get things out faster
and often did a good job at that. Though it did well with networking,
it didn't do so well with PC Card, so it's rather a mixed bag.

The only reason I keep replying to this thread is that the simple
narratives that people keep repeating often times aren't so simple
and the factors going into things tend to be much more complex
and nuanced.
