It's a measure of Unix having been wounded by its own success.

fork() is a great model for a single-threaded text processing pipeline to
do automated typesetting.  (More generally, anything that is a
straightforward composition of filter/transform stages.)  Which is, y'know,
what Unix is *for*.

It's not so great for a responsive GUI in front of a multi-function
interactive program.

These days, the vast majority of Unix applications are "stuff people play
with on their phones."
