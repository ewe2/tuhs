I frequently hear of something referred to as "a (Microsoft) Word 
{document,file}".

They are a bag of mail / news / remote commands / file transfers that 
are used by UUCP.

I'm not saying it's correct or not.  I'm just saying it's what I 
frequently hear them referred to as.

I was hoping that someone has some sort of authoritative information as 
to why they were called "bag".
