Well, Gosling Emacs had mocklisp which, despite its name, isn't a Lisp.  GNU Emacs has elisp which *is* a Lisp (albeit a fairly horrid one).

There's no doubt that GNU Emacs had its roots in Gosling Emacs, but only in much the same way that FreeBSD has its roots in 6th edition Unix.

There's also no real doubt that RMS was responsible for Emacs *as an idea* as opposed to any particular implementation (Guy Steele is I think the other person who might be held responsible, but I believe he's said that it was RMS, which is good enough for me).
