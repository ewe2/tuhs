Subject: [TUHS] JPLDIS - still extant?
Message-ID: <200503272110.55929.wes.parish@paradise.net.nz>

I was looking around for stuff to play with on FreeDOS and I thought, do they 
have any DBMS yet?

So I googled for (dbase public domain) and got something about the aforesaid 
JPLDIS, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Display and Information System.

Anyone got any ideas of its continued existence?  (It's written in Fortran, I 
judge, and I think there are a few PD Fortrans out there that could be used 
to reanimate it. ;)

Thanks
