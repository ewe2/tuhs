It has been updated again:

 The origin of the name cron is from the Greek word for time, χρόνος (chronos).[2][3] (Ken Thompson, author of cron, has confirmed this in a private communication with Brian Kernighan.)

So it would appear that if enough people bang on enough keyboards on the Wikipedia site, things can change.
