This surely leads to nowhere without going into detail, and that
is hard in respect to the dramatical losses that happened on
archives etc., due to whatever reason.  You may confuse personal
opinion.  That happens.

To me it sounds rather like a modification of "Bogen", which can
mean quite some different things itself, from a "bend" (so the
profession of a wood-bender comes to mind at a glance, "b=C3=B6ge" is
also the conjugation of "bending" "er b=C3=B6ge" thus "he would bend"),
also the weapon "bow", so they could have been happy producers or
unhappy consumers of such things as well.  Of course a "Bogen" is
also needed to play a Violin but putting some strings while
a thunderstorm approaches, hm, so i stay clear from that, i "make
a Bogen around it".  Given how many right politicians have that
name, i let it be good for now.

Cheerio,
