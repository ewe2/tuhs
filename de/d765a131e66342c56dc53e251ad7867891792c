William That=E2=80=99s right. 4.1a supported at least these plus the origina=
l Xerox 3m card and I think a card MIT made for chaos and the protean card. i=
irc.  We had one of each of the production 10M Ethernet cards in the cad lab=
 at UCB at some point.  The machine dec gave us had a dec card and that was t=
he only dec card on campus so Sam would come over to my lab to test new OSse=
s on that system.  UCB originally bought 3com cards (eventually in the cad g=
roup I got some early interlan cards from their ceo to test and I remember w=
e liked them better for some reason I don=E2=80=99t remember). Before we had=
 the 3COM based 10M link, we had couple of 3M Xerox cards on the original li=
nk back to Evans hall.=20

The Xerox cards were used with the BBN tcp before 4.1a.  Eric cooper brought=
 all that up with Sam and Bob Kriddle Iirc. =20

That was all switched to the 3com cards pretty early to get 10M and Early af=
ter 4.1a and I do remember sam and I had used all that to debug Routed as we=
 had the CAD Ethernet in Cory Hall, the back link to Evans and another Ether=
net in the Evans machine room. =20
