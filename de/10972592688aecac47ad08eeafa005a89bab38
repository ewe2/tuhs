Subject: [TUHS] who is "Veigh S. Meer"?
Message-ID: <55A7D25F.3050907@solar.stanford.edu>

Peter Salus noted there was workshop in Newport, RI, in 1984 concerning 
"Distributed UNIX." The report on “Distributed UNIX” by Veigh S. Meer [a 
transparent pseudonym] appeared in /;login:/ 9.5 (November 1984), pp. 
5-9. So who was "Veigh S. Meer"? The affiliation says "Bellcore," but 
who was there in 1984?    Peter's first thought was Peter Langston.

Any ideas?

Debbie
