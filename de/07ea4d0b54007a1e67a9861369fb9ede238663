We got hit at Rutgers on some of our ancillary machines early in the day =
(the 750 that belonged really to the the JVN computing center mostly) =
and I collected the evidence and learned through the internet grapevine =
where the vulnerabilities were and plugged them (also wrote some scripts =
to look for the holes and evidence of the worm on other machines at RU). =
   Got everything cleaned up by noon time or so and I figured that was =
the end.   The next day I was scheduled to be in DC on other business so =
I felt confident on leaving.

Apparently however, the biggest impact on us of the worm had yet to hit. =
  The news caught wind of it that evening and started calling the =
computer center early the next morning.   I wasn=E2=80=99t there so it =
pretty much chewed up all of Chuck Hedrick=E2=80=99s day answering press =
inquiries.=
