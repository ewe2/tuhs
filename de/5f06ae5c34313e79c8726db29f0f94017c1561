Subject: [TUHS] shutdown for pre-v7 unix
Message-ID: <CADxT5N5aUTFQ3-XYPDsW3tX6qYwQs6eT89XctquK05mdo10LxA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I've been typing sync;sync at the shell prompt then hitting ctrl-e to
get out of simh to shutdown v5 and v6 unix.

So far this has worked fairly well but I was wondering if there might
be a better way to do a shutdown on early unix.

There's a piece of code for Unix v7 that I came across for doing a shutdown:

http://www.maxhost.org/other/shutdown.c

I doesn't work on pre-v7 unix, but maybe it could be modified to work?

Mark
