I bet your backups across the gigabit switch to your NAS are (small) incrementals.

You'll care about having 10gigE when you try a restore from backup.

We have a very persistent problem with storage capacity versus I/O bandwidth, =
which I metaphor as "swimming pools of data, which we fill & drain with garden =
hoses." How many terabytes of stable storage do you have at home?

Further, LANs have always lagged local I/O bandwidth (across PCI, PCIe, etc), =
independent of the nastiness introduced by latency and less-than-ideal data =
transfer protocols. Unix "diskless" workstations were only tolerable because =
the disks were still expensive and there were good reasons to share.
