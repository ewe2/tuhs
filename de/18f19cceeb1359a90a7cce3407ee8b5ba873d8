Fascinating.

My UNIX/32V manual, from Berkeley, bears the date "December, 1978" on 
the cover. I've hand-written "Unix/32V" on it.

The 32V archive on minnie.tuhs.org bears the date "February, 1979" in 
/usr/man/man0/title.

The text of the cover sheets is somewhat different.  My copy is "UNIX 
PROGRAMMER'S MANUAL / Seventh Edition / VAX-11 Version" compared to TUHS 
"UNIX/32V PROGRAMMER'S MANUAL / Version 1.0".

I also note there is no pg.c in the 3BSD distribution.

It seems likely that what Berkeley based 3BSD on was a prerelease of 
UNIX/32V, prior to the "official" 1.0 version, and what while pg.c was 
written in November, it didn't make it onto the tape we got at Berkeley.

Imagine if pg.c had been on that tape! more might never have been 
written. (Of course, we all read TFM, so we might have missed the source 
code all by its lonesome.)

We got UNIX/32V at Berkeley shortly after we got our Vax and decided
we didn't like VMS. Early 1979, I think. If it had had pg, Eric
probably wouldn't have written more.

So if there was a pg in 32V, it must have been added later.
