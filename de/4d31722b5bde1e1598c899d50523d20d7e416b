One of the reasons I continue using MH (now nmh) as my primary
email system is because it works so well with Unixy tools. I
can e.g. do

    pick +TUHS -after '31 Dec 2017' -and -from bakul | xargs scan

To see summary lines of messages I posted to this group this
year. Using MH tools with non-MH tools is a bit clunky though
useful; I just have to cd to the right Mail directory first.

A mail message is really a structured object and if we=20
represent it as a directory, all the standard unix tools can
be used. This is what Presotto's upasfs on plan9 does. With it
you can do things like

    cd /mail/fs/mbox
    grep -l foo */from | sed 's/from/to/' | xargs grep -l bar

But you soon realize standard unix tools are quite a bit
clunky in dealing with structured objects - often you want to
deal with a set of sub components simultaneously (e.g. the=20
pick command above). This problem is actually pretty common in
the unix world and you have to have context/target specific=20
tools. At the same time a unix sensibility can guide the
architecture / design. Something like MH toolset would be
easier to implement if you assume an underlying mbox
filesystem.  Conversely, the same sort of tools can perhaps be
useful elsewhere.

\vague-idea{
Seems to me that we have taken the unix (& plan9) model for
granted and not really explored it at this level much. That
is, can we map structured objects into trees/graphs in an
efficient way such that standard tools can be used on them?
Can we extend standard tools to explore substructures in a
more generic way?
