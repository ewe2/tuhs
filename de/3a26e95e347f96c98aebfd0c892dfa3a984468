We had a vax 11/780, with serial lines to various peoples' offices.
BSD 4.1 at the time IIRC, later 4.2.  The whole ICS dept. at Ga Tech
was using it - faculty and grad students and lab staff (which I was one
of). The load average was constantly in the single digits.

Now add a few blits, where each physical terminal is doing the load of
4-6 virtual ones (using pseudo-ttys) - a shell on each pty and commands
running on each pty.  Bingo! The load average shoots way up.

So, the blit itself wasn't at fault.  All the people taking advantage
of what it could let them do, was.  At some point they wanted the lab
staff to stop using them because of this...
