My interest is tweeked, do you still have the source
for the paper on your editor and perhaps the plan9 source?

I never moved across to acme, I am still a sam addict, but
I am always interested in new ideas.

The Only editors I ever used on Edition-VII where vi and le,
and le I only brushed up against.
