	That could well be the case.  Yes, the simulator is still being
	worked on and maintained.

	Ah, ok.   That tends to reinforce the thought that Ultrix may be
	too picky about something.

	Yes indeed you can use the RP06 images "bits as is".  As long as
	the disk image is exactly an RP06 (the only size supported that I
	can see by P11) nothing more need be done.   In fact that's how I
	switched over from 'sim_2.x' to 'p11' - I just made a copy of the
	disk image and hand crafted a p11conf file.

	Tapes need "conversion" because they have to contain information 
	about record lengths and end of file markers.   Disk images are
	a simple collection of bytes.

p.s. here's what I use for P11's conf file - perhaps it will be of use.  The
     disk image "2.11BSD" is referenced on the line 'dev 0 ./2.11BSD  1999'
