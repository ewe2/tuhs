Sounds like a TIP, "Terminal IMP".  It was an IMP with double the amount
of memory.  In the upper half there was software to talk to a modem pool
for dial-in access to the network.  "Less than ideal", sure.  Modem
speeds were often 10-30 characters per second.  Much more fun to sit at
a video terminal next to the host.

In some cases there was an IMP which hooked up to some local hosts, but
they also wanted to connect a computer that not in the same building but
in the area.  That's when a VDH type interface was used.

That's very good.  I hope the NCP support there is in good shape.

TCP had been underway since 1973.  Experiments called "TCP bakeoffs"
started around 1979.

I'm not sure.  I have the impression the Pluribus computer isn't well
documented.

It might not be too hard to write an IMP replacement from scratch.
