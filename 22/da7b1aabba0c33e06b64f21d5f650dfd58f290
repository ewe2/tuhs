    > By 'upload it' do you mean the full dump or TECO only?

At this point in time, not the full dump (below for why).

I have previously uploaded lots of other bits, e.g. (looks quickly): the
TCP/IP that was written for it (with the TCP in the 'user process', making
for a small system, good for -11/23's and -11/40's); Montgomery EMACS; TECO
(already done - along with the MACRO-11, but I still need to do the linker,
and the BCPL compiler one needs for the linker).

Unfortunately, the dump includes _everything_ on the system, including
personal email, etc, etc. So I have to curate it anything I upload.

I suppose I should put together an 'index page', which lists (and links
to) everything that has been uploaded?
