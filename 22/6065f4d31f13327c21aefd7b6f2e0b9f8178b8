The text you quoted makes it clear that the judge didn't rule that
they had fallen into the public domain.  He'd ruled that he didn't
think that AT&T would be successful at demonstrating a good copyright
title to the code if the matter went to trial.  A subtle difference,
to be sure, but an important one.

However, given that caldera released them with a bsd-like license, I
think the issue is effectively moot at this point...
