I would have thought that if we consider the amount of engineering
resources to that was invested to get from Solaris 2.0 to 2.5.1, if
that had instead been invested into making SunOS a scalable SMP OS,
that it would have been doable.  Do you think that's fair?

Of course, that's assuming that Sun could have stayed afloat without
that injection of cash from AT&T....
