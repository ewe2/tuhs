We got the first release of VAX-C for VMS at school. It didn't have the
Stream I/O mode and all kinds of software was totally broken. There were
stern warnings in the release notes about this as well, IIRC. However, in
the next release it required an upgrade to the next rev of VMS since the C
runtime now depended on the Stream I/O features and all those programs that
were broken mostly worked w/o change. Took another few releases before
things liked exit() worked in a Unix-y way rather than as a thin wrapper
for SYS$EXIT() and such...
