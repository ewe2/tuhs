Actually, they've been more frequent of late.

Google chose an alternative approach to avoiding the 23:59:60 issue and will
smear the upcoming leap second across the period 2016-12-31 14:00:00 UTC
through 2017-01-01 10:00:00 UTC (see https://developers.google.com/time/smear).
Of course, this means that mixing time.google.com with normal NTP servers
will have "interesting" effects.
