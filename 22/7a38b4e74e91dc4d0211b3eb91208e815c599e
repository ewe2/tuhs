How about addid a couple of modern FOSS Unix descendants like FreeBSD
and NetBSD and OpenSolaris. It would be great to see just how much V7
code still lives in these newer systems.

Anyway, I don't have anything new to offer except for my words of
gratitude. The source comparison feature is just plain awesome. It
makes me feel like one of those scientists who figures out family
trees by doing DNA comparisons ;)
