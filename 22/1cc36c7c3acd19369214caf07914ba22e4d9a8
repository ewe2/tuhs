The theory that Unix stood for "Emasculated Multics" has never quite
died...

At one point, a couple of people (I don't remember who) thought it was
funny to answer the phone in the Lab by saying, in a high squeeky
voice, "Unix Room".Â  They gave it up after a couple of people just
hung up...

 I started using Unix in ~1977 at UC Santa Barbara. At some point
 around then we decided to host a Unix users meeting in the U-Cen
 student union building. We asked the facilities people to prepare
 a sign pointing to the meeting room.

 Imagine my reaction when I walked into the building and saw
 the following sign:

 "Eunuchs Group Meeting - Room 125"

 I don't know if any eunuchs actually showed up.
