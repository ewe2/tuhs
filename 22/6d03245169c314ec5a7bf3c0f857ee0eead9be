Here is an asm program to mount /usr, which assembles with "as". This
replaces my hand-crafted one from yesterday.

/ rkmnt.s: mount /dev/rk0 onto /usr
/ Assembles with V1 "as" on V1 kernel with 0407 patch

exit  = 1.
write = 4.
mount = 21.

        mov     $1,r0
        sys     write; rk0; 8.
        mov     $1,r0
        sys     write; usr; 4.
        sys mount; rk0; usr
        sys exit

rk0:    </dev/rk0\0>
usr:    </usr\0>
