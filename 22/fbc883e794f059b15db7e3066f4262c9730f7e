Nice. I=E2=80=99ve always marveled at how, dare I say it while not doing any=
thing about it, badly, dynamic linking has fared in nearly every os I can th=
ink of? It is a very convenient feature to have, but the way are implemented=
 can be a little frustrating to a user who isn=E2=80=99t steeped in the inte=
rnals of the implementation.

Thanks for the lesson!
