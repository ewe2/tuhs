Clem Cole:

  On the other hand, we still 'dump core' and use the core files for
  debugging.  So, while the term 'drum' lost its meaning, 'core file' - might
  be considered 'quaint' by todays hacker, it still has meaning.

Just as we still speak of dialling and hanging up the phone,
electing Presidents, and other actions long since made obsolete
by changes of technology and culture.
