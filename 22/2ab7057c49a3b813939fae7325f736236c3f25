My attention is drawn to "salv".

There are these V2 and V3 man pages.
https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dennis_v2/v2man.pdf
https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V3/man/man8/salv.8

I see a V3 man page for dcheck, but nothing for icheck until V6.

So it appears before fsck, and before icheck etc, there was salv, the
file system salvager tool.  Some quick searching reveals that CTSS,
Multics, and ITS all also used the term salv and/or salvager for the
corresponding program, so there's ample precedent.
