Actually, that one never bothered me at all!

I tended to be more annoyed by _extra_ characters; e.g. the fact that 'change
directory' was (in standard V6) "chdir" (as opposed to just plain "cd") I
found far more irritating! Why make that one _five_ characters, when most
common commands are two?! (cc, ld, mv, rm, cp, etc, etc, etc...)
