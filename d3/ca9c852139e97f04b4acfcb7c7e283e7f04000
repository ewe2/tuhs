Can people **please** send posts to one of these two lists, only? Having to go
through and delete every other post (yeah, I know, I could relete _all_
messages to either list, since they are archived, but old habits are hard to
break) is _really_ annoying.

OK, I can see sending an _initial_ query to both lists, to get it to as wide
a circle as possible: _but_ BCC at least one of them, to prevent lazy people
just hitting 'reply all' and thereby sanding out multiple copies of their
reply.

Thank you.
