A while back, there was some discussion of A/UX.  We have an Apple =
Quadra which was able to boot and run A/UX a few decades ago.  If =
someone wants to pay for shipping from the San Francisco Bay Area, this =
charming little machine could be theirs.  Please respond off-list, to =
avoid annoying the neighbors...

P.S. We're packing and moving, so a prompt response is critical.=
