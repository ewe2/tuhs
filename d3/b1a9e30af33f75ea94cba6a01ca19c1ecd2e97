Broadly yes.  2BSD was for the PDP-11, and while it could probably have
been ported to another 16-bit box, I don't think that was ever done by
anyone.  The VAX was the target machine for 3BSD to 4.3BSD.  4.3-Tahoe ran
on the Vax and the Power 6/32, though the latter platform died fairly soon
(but it was worth it because that release separated out portable and
non-portable stuff), and 4.3-Reno on at least HP machines.  Then came the
Great Legal Mess followed by the BSD Explosion.

It was dreary and wearisome.  Cold clammy winter still held sway in this
forsaken country.  The only green was the scum of livid weed on the dark
greasy surfaces of the sullen waters.  Dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed
up in the mists like ragged shadows of long-forgotten summers.
