With modern facilities (hardware, libraries, distributed open source 
development) today's small-scale isn't the same as what it was.  If one 
considers the exuberant size compared to functionality of Node.js (11M 
binary), Emacs (10M), gdb (5.2M), mysql (3.1M), and vim (2.1M), here are 
some examples of smaller-scale programs that punch noticeably above 
their weight.

- git (1.4M) (as a distributed filesystem with rich metadata and 
versioning with configuration management thrown in as a bonus)
- tex (309K)
- curl (154K)
- sudo (121K)
- dot (7.7K plus 730K for its libraries)
- traceroute (53K)

Some libraries that deserve mentioning, when compared to libruby (2.3M), 
libxml2 (2.2M), and libpython2.6 (1.6M), are the following:

- libssl (431K)
- liblua (177K)
- C++ STL (816K for /usr/include/c++/4.8.2/bits/stl_*)

* Numbers are "ls -lh" output from a 2014.03 Amazon Linux AMI on which I 
had an open shell window.

I also think software package management systems are "small-scale", if 
one considers the functionality they offer through the thousands of 
packages they can install.
