Yes, I have v6 running on an 11/34; it's amazing how easy it is to
corrupt the filesystem.  :-)  One of these days, I need to dd another
fresh system disk (RK05) off my "sacred copy" of a PUPS image (tediously
transferred via 9600 baud serial using Warren's excellent vtserver
tools).  In any case, why do you ask?  - Ian

I also removed IPL protection from the return sequence of the trap
routine, still works. Testing was done on Bob Supnik's SIMH PDP-11
simulator with only one terminal. By the way, is anyone running V6 on a
real PDP-11? [snip]
