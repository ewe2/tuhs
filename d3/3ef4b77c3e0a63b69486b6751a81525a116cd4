This was brought to my attention on another mailing list.

"Marking a new chapter for one of the country’s most architecturally
and historically significant buildings, Somerset Development has
announced a new name for the iconic former Bell Labs complex in
Holmdel, N.J. The two-million-square-foot building – now named Bell
Works – is currently undergoing a more than $100-million adaptive
reuse redevelopment that will transform the facility into a dynamic
mixed-use center.”
