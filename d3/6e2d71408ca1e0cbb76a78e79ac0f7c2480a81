g:	the original
G:	a later (HDB?) SVRx version that did 256 byte packets and a seven packet window
f:	X.25 optimized printable-characters-only
x:	similar to above?
z:	Doug Evans wrote this as an alternative to 'f' back when 8-bit paths were not everywhere yet.
i:	'internet'  stream the data. 

g, G, and f, we can get definitions for easily enough I think. For 'z' I can track down Doug, but Taylor UUCP should have the details.
