Subject: [TUHS] Conceivably OT: 80s and 90s era CAD software

I'm wondering, with 80s and 90s era Unix being discussed, if there are
any copies of the 80s and 90s era CAD software extant in some form or
other? (Preferably free to good archive?)

IIRC it was a major driver of graphics capabilities in Unix
workstations around that time.
