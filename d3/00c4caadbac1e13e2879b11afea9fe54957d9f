The market in Israel for software developers is VERY hot.

Based entirely on the emails I get from Linked-In about jobs that may
interest me, there's some C, but a lot more C++, both Windows and Linux.
Also a lot of Python.

Moving here isn't a trivial decision, especially if you don't speak
any Hebrew.  Off-topic. Sorry.

We do, but the strong influence of western (US) culture is eroding it,
which is saddening and frustrating.  This definitely off-topic.
