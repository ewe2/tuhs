Apart from the tools that Johnny mentioned, there is a program I once
write called VTServer, which copies entire disk images into hardware
over a serial interface. The program has since been taken over by Fred
van Kempen, and I don't have a canonical reference to it. However, if
you search for "VTServer fred" on Google, it should turn up.
