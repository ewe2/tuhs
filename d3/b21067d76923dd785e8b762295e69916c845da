Bell Labs was pretty good about labeling tapes shipping out the door
to customers, and I'm guessing this tape falls under this category.
In this case, the printed label would uniquely identify the contents
of the tape.

If this was internal from Bell Labs or a modified 7th edition tape
made by a licensee (it happens, especially for odd device support) then
it might not be what's already been imaged.
