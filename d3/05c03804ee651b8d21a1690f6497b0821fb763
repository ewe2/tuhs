Interesting.  /crp was a regular part of the Research world
in the mid-1980s when I joined up.  It was nothing special,
just an extra file system for extra junk, which might or might
not be backed up depending on the system.

I had no idea its roots ran so far back in time.

I always thought it was an abbreviation for `crap,' though,
oddly, the conventional pronunciation seemed to be creep.
