I can verify for a fact that Locus received bug reports from all over the
world. There was a team in LA set up to handled them.  True, the customers
were reported to be more academic than commercial, but there were
commercial customers..  For instance, I was told that my current employer
ran the simulation for then proposed/in-development 80386 on a 370-PS/2
cluster under iTCF  FWIW: I was under the impression they used TCF to
migrate the very long running simulations from two different processors (I
don't know that for sure, but I have been told that by two different
people, so I'm comfortable repeating it).

I was also told, for an IBM customer to try to get the product was quite
difficult.  IBM sales basically tried really hard to not provide it and you
had to know about it and know you to ask to get it.  Charlie may know more,
but he was working on AIX/RS-6000 which as has been pointed out was a
separate code base.

As for finding an old copy of AIX/370 or AIX/386 (which are the same except
for specific code that cared), I wish you good luck.  IBM kept the IP
locked up.   We were firewalled at Locus and the code was only on a couple
of very special systems and access was tightly controlled.   I was not on
that team, so I never saw their raw IP ( so I would not be contaminated as
I was one of the TNC architects).  But I was allowed to talk with Bruce and
Greg who were the TCF architects.   We did all talk about common issues;
but Greg and Bruce stayed out the TNC IP (until after the IBM contract
ended) and myself and Roman stayed out of TCF.
