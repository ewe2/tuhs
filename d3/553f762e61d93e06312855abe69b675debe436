Thanks!

November 1985 issue has an article by Bill Gates.

Gates wrote that they were optimistic to achieve 400,000 XENIX 
installations -- their critical mass -- within 18 months.

"... IBM has announced XENIX as the multi-user operating sysytem for the 
IBM PC-AT."

"Significantly, at the time the XENIX project was started [mid 1980], 
the IBM Personal Computer had not been announced."

What happened with XENIX?  I know it had some success (I used at least 
one retired system with it), but nothing near the other offerings on the 
PC family.
