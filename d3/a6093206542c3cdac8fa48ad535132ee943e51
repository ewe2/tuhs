Well, an HP Proliant (or Dell or Lenovo, etc.) machine, with its 
hardware-RAID battery-backed hard disk controller, redundant power supplies, 
lights-out remote access to firmware/BIOS, and 512 GB or more of RAM, is not 
exactly a "white box" PC - although it is undoubtely PC-based. Those things 
are mass-produced for the Windows market, but run Linux just the same.

If that system can be had, with Linux and full or source code, for 20% of 
the cost of a similar "highly touted" AIX or HP/UX or SPARC machine... 
well, that's pretty much a game over situation for several formerly 
incumbent UNIX-branded vendors.

Totally agree. But it's also a statement about how when UNIX (the by hackers, 
for the hackers, operating system) closed its source code, it signed its 
future, unappealable, certain demise.

In "internet lingo": UNIX closed its source, that was felt as breakage, and
it was "routed around". Therefore, Linux.

Fellow list member Larry McVoy shaw it comming from the very beginning, he
has a paper about it: http://www.landley.net/history/mirror/unix/srcos.html
