It’s the pipe that was genius.  When I first heard the idea, I thought it was preposterous. My
programs’ outputs were designed for the line printer, with carriage control characters.  How
could this idea be useful?

These tools are powerful--I co-founded a company out of network probe software mostly designed
around filters.   And it scales beautifully to multi-core computing.  I had movie visualization software
suddenly nearly double in speed one day.  They had doubled the number of CPUs in the ferric cluster.

My favorite filter:  the unsort (or scramble) command.  
Honeyman’s “idiom” command:
sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
