In the valley it is well known that ideas are easy and execution is hard.
Unless you have been responsible for shipping a big product and supporting
it, it's hard to imagine how hard that is.  There is absolutely an art
to knowing when to release and when to keep fixing bugs.  I think it
was Keith Bostic who had that touch but I'm not positive.  Someone did
and having that ability is at least as important as having the ideas.
A lot less "sexy" but every bit as important.
