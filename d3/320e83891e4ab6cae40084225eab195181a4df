It's not surprising that System V branding occurred pre-divestiture.
Remember that they were already marketing System III circa 1980.

As I've mentioned before, when I saw the UNIX 4.0 system in 1981, I was told
that the Bell System ran the current version and released the earlier
one publicly.  Knowledge of the upcoming divestiture apparently caused
someone to decide to just make the internal and external releases the same.

Dunno if this helps. :-)
