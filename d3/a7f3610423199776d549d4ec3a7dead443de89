Indeed.  Some might argue that there's a resurgence of Usenet servers. 
I'm just one example that's has decided to run a text only news server. 
I see more of them every year.

I personally don't object to content leveraging the Usenet 
infrastructure, *as* *long* *as* *it's* *legal*.

I can personally decide if I want to partake / consume in content or 
not.  â€”  Obviously my text only news server does not partake in 
non-textual content.

Yep.

I'm showing 164 messages since October 10th 2017.

% ls -1 /var/spool/news/articles/alt/sys/pdp10 | wc -l
164
% ls -l /var/spool/news/articles/alt/sys/pdp10 | grep 2017
-rw-rw-r-- 1 news news 1463 Oct 10  2017 1

Fair.

I wonder how different things would be if various web applications 
leveraged Usenet (NNTP) (or IMAP) as a back end storage for things like 
blogs / forums.

I question if there is really anything to take back.  I was active in 
comp.mail.sendmail for years and then stopped when I changed jobs.  All 
I had to do was subscribe my news reader and continue like nothing ever 
changed.  (Save for the smaller amount of content in said newsgroup 
these days.)

I've personally run small news servers with ~10 peers twice.  One time 
years ago, and again now I have two news servers.  One is on my VPS with 
a bunch of peers and the other is in my house that only peers with my VPS.

If anyone wants to get back into the game, let me know and I'll happily 
peer with you.

I think that "take back" really directly translates to "use again".
