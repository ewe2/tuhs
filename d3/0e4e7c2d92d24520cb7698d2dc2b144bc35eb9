The MASTER lamp signifies that the CPU has the unibus, hence a  
similar problem
to using BUS BUSY. You could use KERNEL/SUPERVISOR/USER signals as an  
indication
of context switches. My favourite is a light chaser using the data  
display from
the idle loop. Only works on an 11/45/50/55/60/70 (a bit boring on a  
11/60 as
it had a 7 segment display).

Got one in my office. The lightpen latches the current x/y  
coordinates from
the d/a converters. Aim it at something that will trigger it and you  
get random
hits all over the screen
