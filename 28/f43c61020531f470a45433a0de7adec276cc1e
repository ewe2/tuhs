Well, this is kind of off topic, but that wasn't my experience at Tek.  There was
an internal course called AFTR (amplifier frequency and transient response) which
was basically a guide to black magic design, then things that you had to know if
as we said, you needed to design amplifiers that were flat from DC to daylight.
This is where one learned about things like t-coils which compensated for bonding
wire impedance in ICs, hook (dC/dV of circuit certain circuit board dialectrics),
and so on.  Plus, we had a policy of making things bulletproof.  Relating it back
to workstations, it was a problem.  We were unable to convince management (well,
there really wasn't any management at Tek) that while customers expected a mil-spec
scope to bounce and keep on working when dropped off of the back of a truck, the
folks who bought workstations expected them to break when dropped.  That's why we
couldn't build an empty box of air for less than a thousand dollars.
