      To communicate with Unix machines, you must have a TCP/IP
      protocol stack that DESQview/X can communicate with. The
      following products are compatible:
           FTP's PCTCP
           HP/Lanman TCP/IP
           Novell's Lan Workplace for DOS
           PathWay Access (from The Wollongong Group Inc.)
           BW-TCP and BW-NFS (from Beame & Whiteside Software Ltd.)
           PC-NFS (from Sun Microsystems)

I remember playing around with it a long time ago - I think I used PC-NFS with it.
