I know that a read-only filesystem for installs is possible.  Pyramid
Technologies used a tape install filesystem called ROFS...guess what
that stands for...

We used it on both cartridge (QIC-150 iirc) and 9 track magtapes... So
there's no special type of drive needed.
It was created by dd-ing  a chrooted specially constructed file tree
(IIRC).   I constructed special ones at my
site with all the site specific info (passwords, groups, etc) on it for
emergency recovery.

It was used for their OS/x (BSD-SysV dual universe for their Risc CPU)
and DCOSx (SVR4 port to Mips R3000).
