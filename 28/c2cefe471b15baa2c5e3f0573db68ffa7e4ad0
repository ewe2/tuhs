Applications which follow the XDG specification (which is what
specified ~/.config are supposed to use ~/.cache for cache files (the
per-user analog of /var/cache) and ~/.local/share for data files (the
per-user analog of /usr/share).  These locations can be overridden by
the environment variables XDG_CACHE_HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME, and
XDG_CONFIG_HOME to override ~/.config.

While I would never under-estimate the ability for application writers
to Get Things Wrong[1], at least in theory there should *not* be state
or cache files stored in ~/.config.

[1] For example, GUI text editors updating precious files in place
using O_TRUNC, as opposed to writing to foo.new, reading the extended
attributes and Posix ACL's from file foo and writing them to foo.new,
calling fsync, and then renaming foo.new to foo --- because The Right
Way is too much trouble for an application author.  Sigh....
