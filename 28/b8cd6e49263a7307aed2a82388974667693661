Subject: Kserve, TU11 Emulator, upload?
Message-ID: <199709170215.MAA01160@henry.cs.adfa.oz.au>

All,
	Given that some of you have found KSERVE, the TU11 emulator code,
and other bootstrap bits & pieces, would it be possible for you for ftp
upload them to one of my machines so I can add them into the PUPS archive?

Address is minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au, ftp in as anonymous, you will find
/incoming world-writable (for a few days anyway!). A README.XXX would also
be helpful!

Thanks again,

	Warren

Also, while I'm thinking, email in your hotlist of PDP-11 related URLs,
both http:// and ftp:// sites. I just went to look for KSERVE myself and
haven't found it yet. Having a set of URLs to try would be nice!

All,
	I've got both the TU58 emulator and KSERVE, and placed them
along with the PDP-11 emulators and the tools I have for extracting
files from old tapes/disk images at:

	ftp://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/pub/PDP-11

The PUPS web pages have also been rearranged, with details of how
to set up 6th and 7th Edition UNIX and also 2.11BSD. Web page at:
