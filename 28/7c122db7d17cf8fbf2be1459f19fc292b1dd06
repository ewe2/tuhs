My two cents here is that the problem with the evolution of linux is that
many, many people are adding new stuff while the existing stuff is decaying.
Sure, the kernel is pretty stable, but user land is a mess where one has a
choice of many versions of everything, each of which is broken in a different
way.  My engineer's perspective is that the overcomplexity from lack of
architecture is resulting in reliability and maintenance issues.

And, if you can actually make a better file system, please go for it, you're
a better person than me.  I've looked that that code, and it's huge, has no
clearly defined entry and exit points, and is undocumented.  While I've been
too busy to deal with stuff, I found some minor bugs and a possible big
performance improvement just from trying to read the code.

I don't think that "it mostly works most of the time" is a great metric.
