I can second that. At the time I was asking about an OS suitable for my
brand-new 486 while I was at the U of Canterbury NZ, I was told I'd need to get
an AT&T license for BSD, and those cost a king's ransom.

Does anybody have copies of the kind of legal guff AT&T put these universities
through? It would make interesting reading.
