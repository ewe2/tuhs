Hey all,
I've been recently working on researching ARPANET and the like for use in
an upcoming video. As a starting point, I've been looking at the early UNIX
networking code in archives, specifically, the NOSC tarball, and I've spent
quite a few hours trying to get building on livestreams.

What I've found is that there's corruption issues in code; which is noted
in JOHNS-NOTE, although it's more severe than I realized. For example
sys4.c is entirely corrupted, and part of impio.c is cut off. However, this
isn=E2=80=99t quite as bad as it sounds. For example, by kitbashing both th=
e
original v6 source code, and the later BBN TCP code, I was able to create a
sys4.c that builds and links which should be close to the original.
Furthermore, it is possible to use the =E2=80=9Cvdh=E2=80=9D target instead=
 of the imp
target to at least try and get the code building. I did successfully get a
kernel to build, and it even prints out a mem message before deadlocking.

My guess is it's either deadlocked waiting for the IMP, or there=E2=80=99s
something wrong with the build. There=E2=80=99s some indication that it mig=
ht need
a split kernel, although I=E2=80=99ve not had any success with that thus fa=
r. I
have uploaded my current build tree to git, as well as tarball with simh
images if anyone wants to try and figure out what has gone wrong. I admit,
my knowledge of PDP-11 assembly and debugging platforms is a bit wanting :)

There=E2=80=99s some indication that this, and the later BBN TCP (which is =
from
around the same time period) code were built on top of the Programmer=E2=80=
=99s
Workbench vs. stock v6; especially because some code patches were needed to
get it to build. I did look at the TUHS PWB archives, I see a bunch of
binaries, but absolutely no idea how to install them. I=E2=80=99ve heard th=
at none
of these archives are actually complete, but I'm hoping someone might have
some idea of how to go forward, since, if nothing else, I=E2=80=99d like to=
 end
this with a success story, although I=E2=80=99m happy with as far as I got.

Furthermore, I do know that I can run some of the ARPA level utilities in
MIT ITS on CHAOSNET, which will be an upcoming project, although that is
going to be a dive in and of itself.

In short, I=E2=80=99m hoping someone might be able to provide some insight =
into
where things have gone wrong:
  * Is the netunix kernel I built hanging because of corrupted code, or is
it waiting for non-existent hardware.
* NOTE: The DC-11 driver was not included, but I don=E2=80=99t think I need=
 that
for a single console?
  * Is there any versions of PWB that is =E2=80=9Ceasily=E2=80=9D installab=
le, since its
very clear the later BBN code requires it (it refers to ncc explicitly)?
  * I know IMPs have been emulated, and even have successfully routed
packets, so I=E2=80=99m also trying to figure out how much would still be n=
ecessary
to actually recreate a minimal ARPA network?

I did try to build some of the NCP applications regardless; it does appear
that some parts are simply missing. Mailer.cc seems to want a hnconv.o but
no source file exists. The FTP daemon on the other hand wants a library
simply called =E2=80=9Cj=E2=80=9D.

My guess is that even if the NCP code was buildable, the applications might
not be. However, this did make me take a closer look at the BBN code, and
it does have an ifdef for NCP, suggesting that it was still
usable/supported? It makes sense, it seems to have been written before the
TCP/IP flag day. I=E2=80=99m just not sure where to approach compiling it.

I=E2=80=99ve uploaded the code with patches to build with the v6 compiler t=
o github
here: https://github.com/NCommander/network-unix-v6/tree/attempted-repair

NOTE: v6's cc needs a seperate patch to increase the symbol table size;
that's done in the disk image.

My livestreams (12 hours or so) are on my YouTube channel:

Feel free to forward this to other lists that may have PDP-11 or ARPANET
experts!
