I use nvi or acme. Haven't touched sam in ages. Having taught
my fingertips nvi 37 years back, I can edit the fastest in it.
But some things are easier in acme + with its multiple panes
and smaller antialiased fonts it makes much better use of a
retina display. iterm/screen + nvi can't match that.

Until about 95 I used nvi & the Rand Editor (later Dave Yost's
version). The latter was the easiest to use + it did multiple
editing windows much before nvi or vim.
