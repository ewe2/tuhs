Subject: mknod device numbers
Message-ID: <m0tKk08-00000DC@swift.eng.ox.ac.uk>


First off, thanks to all the people who gave me info for the rk? and
rrk? devices. That now works. I now come to the question of tty
devices.

On v5 and v6, the single terminal device which is set up is /dev/tty8
(c 0 0). This suggests to me that the system is build with a DZ11 (or
similar) as tty0 to tty7. Am I correct in this assumption? 

My system has a pair of DL11s, and one of them works happily as
tty8. I'd like to get the second interface up and running. I also have
a DZ11, if that is any help. (The second DL11 is set up at present and
works with RT11 using the CONSOL.MAC mechanism to switch ttys. I can't
remember the CSR/VEC, but it is the RT11 default for a second DL11).

Question is:
------------

o  What is the device numbering (major/minor) for a second DL11? (and
   what CSR/VEC should it have?)? Or need I rebuild the system for
   support of a second DL11?

o  Second, is the DZ11 supported by default, and, if so, what CSR/VEC
   should I set, and what are the device major and minor numbers?

Cheers once again,

Bob.

Having got past the emulator stage now (and having had my RK05 fitted
with new heads after a _spectacular_ crash), I've been setting to the
task of resurecting UNIX on the system.

Thanks to John Wilson's excellent KSERVE Kermit server for RT11 I've
been able to transfer v5 and v6 disk images to RK05. 

v6 boots just fine, and runs without any real drama. v5, much to my
suprise, does not ...

First off, my hardware is:

	11/34a (no fpp, no cache)
	124K word (248Kb) MOS
	2 x DL11-W 
	RX11
	RK11D

	1 x RK05
	1 x RX01

v5 boots to the '@' prompt. Entering the kernel name at this prompt
(this is the kernel for the RK05, obviously), causes a great deal of
disk activity - far more than for v6, in fact. The disk activity
stops, but no login prompt is presented. The processor is not halted,
but is executing a relatively tight loop.

Under emulation (using Bob Supnic's pdp11 emulator), v6 ran fine, but
v5 caused TRAPS every so often. It occurs to me that the behaviour
I've seen on the real 11/34 corresponds to a trap observed using the
emulator. The emulator can be 'continued' after a trap and all is
well. Since the 11/34 doesn't actually halt, but merely sits in a
tight loop, I can't see how to proceed.

Question is, is what I'm seeing a kernel panic? Since nothing is
output to the tty, after the '@' prompt, it may be that the kernel
doesn't like the look of my DL11 configuration? Alternatively,
everything may be AOK, and running, except that no login prompt is
produced on the tty.

Interestingly UNIX causes a UNIBUS reset as it finishes booting. This
is evidenced by the clattering of the RX01.

Naturally it's not necessary for me to get v5 going, since v6 is fine,
but it would be extremely interesting to find out what is going on. v7
seems to give a great deal of TRAPs on the emualtor, so maybe that
would not like the real hardware either judging from current
observations.

What do people think about this?

Cheers,

Bob.

Bob, I got the v5 image from the PUPS archive to run under Bob Supnik's
emulator by using the bootblock from the v6 image:

The bootblock is uuencoded below. I've modified the simulator to have
a .pdp11rc so I don't have to type in the boot commands. I should
put the diffs somewhere.
