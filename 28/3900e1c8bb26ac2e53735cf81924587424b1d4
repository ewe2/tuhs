Mahlzeit,

some years after losing my MO drive and unable to access my
PUPS copy I would like to redownload it before it perhaps
vanishes. I have forgotten my access data. I believe it was
with rsync. And with all the borken links on the website and
the time going by I am not sure what the current status is.
Is Warren still here? His last posting was from April last year.

Mahlzeit,
Matthias
