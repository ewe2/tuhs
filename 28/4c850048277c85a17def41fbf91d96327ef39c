We wanted to call the window manager "panes" on Aix (Aches and Pains).

My only real memory of beating on the RS/6000 was that while it had a 24-bit
graphics card, the X server didn't have a 24-bit visual.
That and I was able to break into the demo box IBM sent me by turning the
key to the "wrench" position and then shell escaping out of a more command
it launched.

I spent more time hacking the 370/PS2/i860 version of the kernel which was a
unified source base.
This had switching console contexts they called the "High Function
Terminal."    We named our i860 version of it the "Low Function Terminal."
