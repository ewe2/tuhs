I try to choose my words carefully, and here I wrote "supports" on
purpose even though it is a much overused word.

Linode will let me run FreeBSD, no problem, but they will not support
it.  That means, for example, no backups.

So when you write that DO "does" FreeBSD, how far do they go on the
support scale?
