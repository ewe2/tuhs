One of ZFS's particularly lovely features was that there was no offline filesystem checker at all.  So if you have a filesystem (pool, whatever) which you think something bad might have happened to, you check it *by mounting it*, where the checker runs *in the kernel, so any serious error in the code means a panic, if you're lucky and something worse if you're not.

When I found out about this I thought seriously of shorting Sun's stock (if I knew how to do that).  I would have made money.  As it was we stuck with logged UFS which, by 2007 or so was seriously bulletproof.
