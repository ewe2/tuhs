Clem, I think pretty much all you are writing is correct, except that I 
don't get your reference to the PDP-11 MMU.

The MMU of the PDP-11 is not some base/limit register thing. It's a 
paged memory, with a flat address space. Admittedly, you only have 8 
pages, but I think it's just plain incorrect to call it something else.
(Even though noone I know of ever wrote a demand-paged memory system for 
a PDP-11, there is no technical reason preventing you from doing it. 
Just that with 8 pages, and load more physical memory than virtual, it 
just didn't give much of any benifits.)
