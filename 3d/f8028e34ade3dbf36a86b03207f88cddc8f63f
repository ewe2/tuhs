​Dave I don't understand this statement.  We ran Seventh Edition on 11/40
class processors more than anything else.  The issue was lack of separate
I/D space and the kernel got large so you ran out of physical memory.   The
later was solved with things like the Able ENABLE, which I admit I put one
 couple of 11/34 and our 11/60 (which are 11/40 class).  But V7 ran fine on
it.
