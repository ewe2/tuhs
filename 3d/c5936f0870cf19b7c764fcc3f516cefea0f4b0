Prior to TCP, we also had our own homegrown ARPAnet V6 code in the kernel.    We actually got to pick up some systems when the ARPANET NCP switched to long leaders were our UIllinios ANTS system wasn't going to support.     At the same time we had the early BRLNET which essentially was a system to forward BUF structures and the associated data between machines both over a PCL-11 parallel link and some "high" speed DQ-11 serial links.    This gave us some rudimentary file sharing between our systems.
