I started on Unix in the =E2=80=9880=E2=80=99s and it was to help out a frie=
nd with adding waves to a ray tracing system he was building. I knew C at th=
e time... my friend gave me like 5 vi commands and sat me down in front of t=
he terminal with a visual bell. (Luckily I don=E2=80=99t have epilepsy or al=
l that flashing would have had me in seizures :-) )

After answering about 30 questions about library calls available, he taught m=
e the most useful thing I ever learned for Unix. =E2=80=9Cman -k | grep <wor=
d>=E2=80=9D.  =46rom there on out, I was on my own and completely equipped t=
o learn all I needed.=20

As a side note, when I saw Google fir the first time, I said =E2=80=9Coh, ma=
n -k | grep for the web....=E2=80=9D
