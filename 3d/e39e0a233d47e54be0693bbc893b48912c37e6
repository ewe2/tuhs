Seems reasonable to me give the code path and time its being called.  Maybe
left over from hacking from an earlier kernel requirement and never noticed
by Ken.  I wonder if the mount table had been set up in some earlier scheme
and he wanted to make sure it was checked first.  That's the only thing
that seems logical, but we all miss optimizations.
