Subject: [TUHS] mt Xinu Unix manuals
Message-ID: <fc99c4e1-523b-27e9-f841-2acc8c24207f@solar.stanford.edu>

A while ago someone was asking about the mt Xinu Unix manuals.  I have a 
found a complete set, currently owned by Vance Vaughan, one of the mt 
Xinu founders.  He is willing to donate them to Warren's Unix archive.  
However, they are too expensive to ship to Australia.

Would anyone be willing to scan them in for the archive?  Ah, there are 
a lot of them (8? volumes).   If so, I might be able to ship them to 
somewhere in the US.

Let me know.

Thanks.
Deborah
