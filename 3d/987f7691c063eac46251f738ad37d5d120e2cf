There is also SGI's Iris Universe, which was their in-house magazine. I have no idea when it started or ceased but I have quite a few of the early and mid 1990s issues that have really great articles and advertisements. 

I'll have to see if I can find them and scan them in to share.

The one I remember in particular was "Unix Review", but there were a few "journal" type magazines that also specialized in Unix-y things (e.g., ";login:" from USENIX; still published, I believe), and several associated with particular vendors: "SunExpert" was one, if I recall correctly.

I can remember in particular an issue of "PC Magazine" (I think June of 1993) that ran a lengthy couple of articles proving machines from Sun and SGI, in addition to version of Unix that ran on PCs (interestingly, Linux was omitted despite really starting to capture a lot of the imagination in that space; similarly I don't recall any mention of BSD).
