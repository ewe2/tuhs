I accidentally stumbled across this:
   http://www.excelsior-usa.com/krg/krg.html

Perhaps only marginally relevant to tuhs.  It's a historic soviet system 
modelled after Wirth's Lilith system.  There's an emulator on the page 
that works in windows.  You can log in as "sys" with no password.  There 
are some familiar unix commands like "cd" and "ls", and others like "find" 
which seem to differ from the traditional unix commands.  The system is 
written in modula II.  There is some account information in /usr/etc and 
some docs (I think /doc or /usr/doc?) but they are in russian.

I'd love to hear more about the system if anyone here knows more about
it.
