Actually they do, RFC722 was not quite as crisp as this which 833 replaced,
but even with 722 the intention was pretty clear and examples described
"case independence of certain special atoms."   With 833, Crocker cleaned
up the language to be simply:

From RFC833, Section 3.4.7 CASE INDEPENDENCE

Except as noted, alphabetic strings may be represented in any combination
of upper and lower case. The only syntactic units which requires
preservation of case information are:

   - text
   - qtext
   - dtext
   - ctext
   - quoted-pair
   - local-part, except "Postmaster"

   When matching any other syntactic unit, case is to be ignored.
