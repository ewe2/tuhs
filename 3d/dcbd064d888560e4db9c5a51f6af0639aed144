Yep, as we say, it has more holes in it than Sonny Corleone.

@Warner Losh - the picture with the blue balloons is so wrong....   There are a ton of errors, starting with claiming PWB 1.0 came from Fifth Edition

In case people are wondering, I found this https://www.quora.com/What-is-Unix-and-why-is-it-important which contains a blue-oval chart that shows it being derived from CB Unix 3. But that the sources were also different than the ones for VAXen, etc. At least that's the implication here. Is this chart in error?

It contains Features from CB Unix but was not the same thing.  In particular shared memory and semaphores were contributed by Dale’s team but it was PWB 3.0 that was rebranded system III and then updated and released by USG aka summit eventually as sys V.   System IV was not released outside the bell system I’m not sure if it ever went out inside. 

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.
