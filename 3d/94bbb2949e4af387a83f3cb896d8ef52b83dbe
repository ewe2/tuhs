It doesn=E2=80=99t work the same way. I just tried it =
(vim-8.0.something).
The way it is supposed to work is this:  the first u undoes the last =
change.
Then you keep hitting . to keep undoing more. Then if you went back too =
far,
you hit u again, to undo the undo and further . will keep redoing. You =
can
go back and forth this way as many times as you wish.
