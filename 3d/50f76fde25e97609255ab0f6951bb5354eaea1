The earliest stream-I/O-system-based tty driver I'm aware of was
already in the Research kernel when I interviewed at Bell Labs
in early 1984.  I have a vague memory that it was a couple of
years older than that, but I cannot find any citations to
back up either of those memories.

Dennis described streams in the special Unix issue of the
BSTJ, Oct 1984, and noted that "it runs on about 20 machines in
... Research ... Although it is being investigated in other
parts of AT&T Bell Laboratories, it is not generally available."
The manuscript was received October 18, 1983.
