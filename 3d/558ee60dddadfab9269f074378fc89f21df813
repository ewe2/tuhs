I remember a bs command (which was some kind of mini-BASIC) in the   
4.2BSD machine I first used.  However it may have been added by the  
vendor rather than have been in 4.2BSD proper.

I used it at the time, and have occasionally missed it since - nothing  
I now use regularly  (OSX and Solaris) seems to have it.
