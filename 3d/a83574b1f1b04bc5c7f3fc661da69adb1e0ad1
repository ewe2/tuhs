The London/Reiser internal memo about experiences in
porting Unix to the VAX emerged from the company
archives, and I scanned and OCRed it: it's underneath

  http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/portpapers.html

As the page cautions, the HTML is missing some stuff, but
the PS and PDF are reasonably good.  I also have the
big pre-OCR PDF image scan if anyone wants to check details.
