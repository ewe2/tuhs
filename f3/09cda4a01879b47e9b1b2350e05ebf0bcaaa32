It looks like some sources and mailung list archives for OpenSSI are
still available sourceforage:

	https://sourceforge.net/p/ssic-linux

From what I can tell, the OpenSSI folks were focsued on porting
OpenSSI to various distributions (Fedora, Debian, RHEL), etc., but
they were not focused on getting any of their changes upstream.  The
only evidence I can find of OpenSSI on the Linux Kernel mailing list
was a forwarded announcement of OpenSSI 1.0:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/410DDFA2.40107@hp.com/T/#r2b3cfcce5ccd8127a8493e7987349a1921597537

And apparently OpenSSI had patches to e2fsprogs (since they had a
clusterfied version of ext3), but no one ever sent the OpenSSI
e2fsprogs patches to me for review.  So it appears that it was not a
matter of "the upstream Linux kernel team.... [being] willing to take
the VPROC changes", it was more like no one asked, or prepared patches
that could be considered by usptream.
