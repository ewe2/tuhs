I primarily write code in Go these days and like it a lot (as
a "better" C) but I am not sure it will have C's longevity.
It still uses a flat shared memory model. This is harder and
harder for hardware to emulate efficiently (and comes with
more complexity) at smaller and smaller minimum feature sizes
and higher & higher CPU clock rates & on-chip comm speeds. We
need something other than a better C to squeeze maximum
performance out of a CPU built out of 100s to 1000s of cores.=
