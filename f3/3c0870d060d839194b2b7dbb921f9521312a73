But it wasn’t about the ordering…

The reason three syncs were recommended was that you needed time to pass to flush the buffers, and some early versions would only schedule the I/O and not wait for it to actually complete before returning. Later versions waited, but by then the disks had buffers of their own that would get missed up if you didn’t wait a smidge before turning them off. So what the second two syncs really accomplished was the passage of time before you did anything stupid.

I’m not so sure about the “ordering guarantee” logic presented in that thread. There’s no “barrier” that the first sync puts in that the second sync waits for. Earlier discussions have suggested the first sync flushes all the dirty blocks and sent out the superblock marked dirty as well. The second sync would see no I/O has happened and send out the superblock clean. And the third sync was because of {lots of theories here}, but mostly was for the passage of time to keep the rule simple.
