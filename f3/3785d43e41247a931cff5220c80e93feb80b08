I don't think they are talking about BSD4.1a having these things, but
rather Research Unix Edition 8 having these things. Bell labs didn't
integrate them until later. I recall reading articles at the time (1983
or 1984) that they had their own notion of what networking to use
that wasn't TCP/IP due to some perceived failings of TCP/IP that
they fixed with their stuff. I recall that I read it in the library in
high school.  Wish I'd forgotten that and recalled what the network
protocol was they implemented instead...
