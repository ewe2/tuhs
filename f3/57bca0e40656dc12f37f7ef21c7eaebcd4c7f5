Subject: [TUHS] Looking for two papers someone may have
Message-ID: <CAP6exYLosQPNC+LzbOfHkeeSTYEgbD6Uy8z_=gza--Kbf+eMzQ@mail.gmail.com>

I recall reading a long time ago a sentence in a paper Dennis wrote which
went something like "Unix is profligate with processes". The word
profligate sticks in my mind. This is a 30+-year-old memory of a probably
35+-year-old paper, from back in the day when running a shell as a user
level process was very controversial. I've scanned the papers (and BSTJ) I
can find but can't find that quote. Geez, is my memory that bad? Don't
answer that!

Rob Pike did a talk in the early 90s about right and wrong ways to expose
the network stack in a synthetic file system. I'd like to find those
slides, because people keep implementing synthetics for network stacks and
they always look like the "wrong" version from Rob's slides. I've asked him
but he can't find it. I've long since lost the email with the slides,
several jobs back ...

thanks

ron
