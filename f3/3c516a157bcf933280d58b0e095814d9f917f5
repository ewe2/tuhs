Hi,

I'm really shocked! RIP Joerg!

It's strange that yesterday suddenly I re-read all my documents and visited=
 all w3 links related to Joerg.=20
I really enjoyed his 'Die Geschichte von UNIX 1969 bis OpenSolaris'. I don'=
t know why, but I did so yesterday.

This is very sad and saddening news.
Sixteen days ago he mailed me last, pretty soon after a many hour
long surgery, too soon in my eyes, and stated to be back among the
living, that it was much more complicated than thought.
He went private at the turn of the year.

 |J=C3=B6rg worked for the Bethold typesetting company, one of the first

 |
 |His interest in SUN OS culminated in Schillix, one of the first
 |open source Solaris distributions.

Not to forget that his dissertation also (among a filesystem
design) included a translation of the entire SunOS system manual
i think, and it is plain it was, in fact, not a translation, but
proof of translucency of the underlaying concepts.

 |We will of course also remember him for his flames.

Berlin Love is sometimes a bit rough.  If you want it smooth you
could buy a robot from Boston Dynamics instead.  Will ya.

Rest in peace dear J=C3=B6rg.
