We lost a co-inventor of ENIAC, John Mauchly, on this day (that's 8th 
January like my headers say) in 1980.  ENIAC is claimed to be the "first 
general purpose electronic digital computer", but I guess it comes down to 
a matter of definition[*], as every culture likes to be the "first" (just 
ask the Penguins, for example); for "computer" you could go all the way 
back to the Mk-I Antikythera (Hellenic variation, from about the 100BC 
production run)...
