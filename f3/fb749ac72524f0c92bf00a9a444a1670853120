Subject: [TUHS] Tim Shoppa's V6 distribution
Message-ID: <3E53B749.D906A2B6@worldnet.att.net>

Hello from Gregg C Levine
Has anyone ever gotten Tim Shoppa's V6 distribution to work, under any
version of Simh? Theoretically it should be possible, but  I haven't a
clew, as to how to do so. Any suggestions? I'll leave the networking
issues alone for the moment.
