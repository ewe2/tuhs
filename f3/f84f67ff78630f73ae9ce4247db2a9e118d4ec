I haven't done it, but wouldn't Kermit be relatively painless over a 
serial line?

I used it on TOPS-10 and SIMH, using a TELNET connection into an 
emulated DZ11 (the version that I got working with SIMH, not the newer one).

Put KERMIT on the BSD side into server mode, and just send all the files 
you want to.
