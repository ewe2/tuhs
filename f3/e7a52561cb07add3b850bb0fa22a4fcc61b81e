Hello!
That definitely groks with a decidedly thirty year old memory. I
remember going to BUSCON, and getting into an interesting discussion
with the folks behind the M68K just how difficult it could be to run
more modern code (or operating systems). Let's just say it was
peculiar. They wanted to stick with a proprietary OS, and one odd man
there wanted to expand CPM-68K. And still another was looking into
bringing up UNIX on it.

It was fun.
