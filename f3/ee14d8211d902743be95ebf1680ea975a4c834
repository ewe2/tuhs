  Check out "The Unix Archive", e.g.,

http://highgate.comm.sfu.ca/pups/PDP-11/Distributions/ucb/2.11BSD/

PUPS (http://minnie.tuhs.org/PUPS/index.html) has a link to various mirrors.

Once you get things installed, check /VERSION.  That will tell you the
patch level of what you have running; IIRC the files above are about ten
or so patches behind.  Not that bad.

  I ran it once on, IIRC, SIMH and it worked fine.
