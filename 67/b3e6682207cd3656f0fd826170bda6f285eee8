The 7, 9, 15 were very compatible.  I think the -15
had some scheme for using an index register, which
the earlier ones didn't have, but it was otherwise
pretty much identical in IS architecture.

There was very little rewriting to try Unix out
on the -9 and -15; perhaps just some tweaks in
the disk device commands.  I don't think the
system actually ran on either for more than a few
hours.  Ken was just playing around.

The -15 may have had an electrically different
bus, but I'm reasonably sure it was not a Unibus.
All of them used IOT instructions, not memory-mapped
IO registers.

Both of the machines we tried were being used by other groups
and we couldn't squat on them as with the PDP-7.
I recall that  the -15's main job was controlling a
step-and-repeat camera that exposed LSI masks.
