Subject: [TUHS] VMS for MicroVAX 2000
Message-ID: <00ec01c37d59$f7242b90$0100a8c0@cicm.iosg.com>

Hello

I know this can be some offtopic as VMS is not a UNIX system, but, I
recently adquired a MicroVAX 2000 for a museum and I'm guessing if I can get
a tarball of the original VMS installation tape or someone could send me a
tape.

Thanks in advance.
