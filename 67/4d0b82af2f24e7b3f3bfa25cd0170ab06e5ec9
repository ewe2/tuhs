Unix arrived at Princeton in the early 1970's and it might have been the
third or fourth edition. The first time I heard about Unix was from one of
my graduate students who was just starting work on his thesis, so it must
have been before 1974. (He got his degree in May 1975 and this the only
date I am sure about ;-)...)

Princeton is geographically close to Murray Hill (30 miles or so) and there
was a lot of interaction between the two. I left Princeton in 1980 to join
1127 and another Princeton colleague had moved a year earlier.
