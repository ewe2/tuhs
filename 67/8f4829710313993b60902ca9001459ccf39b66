I think this is because vi grew out of ex which grew out of
ed, all of which were "line" editors, while the Rand Editor
(and the original NED) assumed a quarter plane model. e had
commands such as box (to draw a box), blank (or was it cut?)
to wipe out all nonblank chars from a rectangle, replace,
overlay (nonblank chars from the copy buffer overwrote data),
underlay (nonblank chars from the copy buffer didn't overwrite
nonblank chars) and so on. It even had justfy, fill and center
commands. It was basically an editor for producing documents
in monspaced fonts!
