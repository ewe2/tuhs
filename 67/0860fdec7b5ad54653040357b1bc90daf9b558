Subject: [TUHS] Unix, eunuchs?

Michael Welle originally asked,

The pun may have been at the back of Kernighan's mind,
but the original explanation was "one of whatever
Multics was many of."  I think the quip about
"castrated Multics" came from MIT.

Incidentally, I don't think the Unics spelling ever occurred
in print, though I could be proved wrong.
