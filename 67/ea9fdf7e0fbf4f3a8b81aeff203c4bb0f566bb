Hi Warren,

I haven't kept up with all messages, but are you aware of the
https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/mailman/admin/tuhs/?VARHELP=general/from_is_list
option, the dmarc_moderation_action it mentions, and how they interact?

IIRC, Mailman can check if the sender's domain is troublesome and only
re-write the From header to itself in those cases, leaving the rest of
our emails alone.

Cheers, Ralph.
