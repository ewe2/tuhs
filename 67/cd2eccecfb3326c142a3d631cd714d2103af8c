I don't think that follows from the copyright headers.  Those can't be  
removed unless there is (essentially) *nothing* remaining of the  
original.

Alternatively, you could say that, yes, it's a System V, but it's a  
late 90s System V (and Solaris 10 is a 2005 System V).  So it depends  
on what you are after I guess: if you want to know what System V was  
like in 1980-something then Solaris won't tell you that, any more than  
OS X will tell you what 4.2 BSD was like.  If you want to know what a  
*modern* System V or BSD is like then, sure, look at Solaris or OS X.
