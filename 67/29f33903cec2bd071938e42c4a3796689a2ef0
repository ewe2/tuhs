Alas, the only thing online there is a list of which floppies he had, not any
actual content (other than one document). I've sent him an email (at the
address given on that site), we'll see if I get a reply. He might not have a
way to read those floppies...

If not, no biggie; in asking I more wanted to make sure I wasn't wasting my
time, I don't really need him to come through. Having done the /40->/23 move,
I'm sure the /05->/03 move won't present any major problems.

BTW, looking around for a copy of a document he mentioned, I found this:

  http://www.tavi.co.uk/unixhistory/mini-unix.html

so between them and the stuff at TUHS, I think we have everything we'd need.
