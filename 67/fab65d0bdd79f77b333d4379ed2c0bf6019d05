There aren't any CRs in the original files. Something got mangled in
the email maybe.

Check out the files from https://github.com/arnoldrobbins/cstr100.  I'm up
to 3 bugs fixed in the 1979 MS macros and one in the paper.  I have also
brought all the references into line with the original, and added the PostScript
of the original as well.

There remains one troff glitch; the inline CW is formatting as underlined
Roman text.  No idea why, and I haven't had time to investigate.  I suspect
the MS macros in use when BWK wrote the paper had evolved somewhat.

HTH,

Arnold
