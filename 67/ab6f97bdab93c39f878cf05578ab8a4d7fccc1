I don't have a running system right now but Coherent 3.2 used V2
config files (L.sys, L-dev, etc.) according to my 1991 manual. A
Coherent manual with a 1993 copyright confirms that later versions
used Taylor UUCP.

My 80286 with Coherent 3.2.1A (last of the 3's and the last to support
the '286) and its UUCP was how I connected to my first ISP. ($5/month
for mail and news. Who needs SLIP!)
