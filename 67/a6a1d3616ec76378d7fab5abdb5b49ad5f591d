Possibly the most time consuming install I did was installing Xenix on a 
bunch of Intel i310 systems.  Xenix was a "secondary" OS for these 
systems, the main OS being iRMX.  Xenix for these systems was distributed 
on 5.25" floppies.  Lots and lots of floppies...  They came in a 3-ring 
binder, many pages of floppies...  We also had a couple of i380 systems, 
Xenix for those came on 8" floppies...  That was time consuming, but it 
was just manual labor.

The most unpleasasnt install I can recall was AIX 2.2.1 on the IBM-PC/RT. 
Which also was really (under the covers) Interactive UNIX, with some other 
stuff mixed in.  Not only was this also time-consuming with a binder full 
of 5.25" floppies, but my recollection is that there were too many 
opportunities to make a tiny little mistake during the install and have to 
start all over again.
