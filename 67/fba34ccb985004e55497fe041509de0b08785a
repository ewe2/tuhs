Oh, and I forgot, then there was the BSDi group.  While we all loved 
those guys, they left a sour taste.  There was some bad blood between
them and Jolitz (he unfairly got the short end of that stick).  And
as Clem says, we all wanted a free or really really cheap Unix and
these guys wanted $995 for a release.  I think a lot of us felt like
they sort of betrayed the ethos of Unix, we wanted free like it was
when you got a tape from dmr (no, I never got one, just got to hear
the stories and they sounded great).

The whole BSD thing in the early 90's was a train wreck.  In my opinion.
