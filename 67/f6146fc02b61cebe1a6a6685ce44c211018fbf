If you understood the architecture and instruction set of the IBM
709/7090/7094 series (I cut my programming teeth on the 7094), you
understood the "quirks" of Fortan: three way branches, indexing arrays in
reverse order, always executing a loop at least once, etc. Fortran
"tricked" the writer into producing code that worked well on those
machines, but was much easier to understand and modify than assembler. Not
all that different from C and DEC boxes, but the IBM machines were less
coherent.
