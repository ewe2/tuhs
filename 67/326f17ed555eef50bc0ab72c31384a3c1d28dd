I think the intent is to to demonstrate that they did not value their trade
secrets and did not make an effort to (even just a show of an effort) to defend
them.  By showing that tens of thousands of people had access to the UNIX
source that was supposed to be a secret and SCO not going after any of them
(unlike, say, Microsoft's defending Windows source) will weaken their arguments
that these were valuable trade secrets.
