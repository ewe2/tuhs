The one amusing thing with my user name (this was back in the JHU eight letter usernames) is I came in to the machine room where we had a log book of all the times the system went down (normally/abnormally) and what you did to bring it back up (this was in the old icheck/dcheck days before FSCK).    It was common when you came in look through the book to see what went bump in the night, so to say.

I found the entry:   “Took the system down.  First nine characters of the accounting file were corrupted.”

I’m saying to myself, “I think I might know how that happened.”   The system manager says “We figured you did.   The characters were your username followed by a colon.”
