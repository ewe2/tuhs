Well, take it with a grain of salt.  I have no actual knowledge of what IBM
was attempting or what really happened.  But from where I sat the evidence
was pretty compelling: they wanted an OpenSolaris port enough to give us
some hypervisor changes we asked for (which certainly must have had
substantial engineering costs for them), and it was pretty clear to me at
the time that Sun was looking for a buyer and that IBM would be a natural
entity to buy them.
