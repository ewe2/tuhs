1) No intention to slight debian in any way.
2) dpkg was definitely an improvement over FreeBSds ports scheme. But... In
fact freebsd did have a pkg system for ports before that --- which was
basically similar to 1983 SysIII scheme
3) also as I understand (and larry feel free to correct me here as a better
chronicler of things Linux than I) but I believe that the big thing rpm
added was the DB like DEC's setld and system Sun had used which us what I
was refering too.

Pls remember that I was trying to chronicle the basic ideas and some of the
motivation which is what Henry asked.   And that the original driver was to
support ISVs installs.  So I was trying to explain the history of what we
did at the time.

The be fair one of the more vocal people in the early 80s was Heinz who
occasionally add color here.  I remember Heinz trying to push us to an ABI
and not stop at an API.

Today most of the ISVs have abandoned Unix except for the Mac. Msft and the
phones have taken that.  And the package mngr has been replaced by the app
store which has.much great use than any of the current Unix packaging
schemes.  Funny how the profit motive drove that.

Working for one of the few ISVS that do package SW for Unix we basically
support two schemes.  Apple Mac installs and RPM because that is were the
primary customer base has been.   I'd not about goodness or being better or
being first.  It's economic (Larry and I bemoan this a lot).

So pls don't take it as a comment about anything other than trying to
answer as much of the early history as I could.

Heinz, Jon, Larry you all lived this on the commercial side.   Care to add
anything?
