I agree with 90% of what he says, but not about Algol 68.  He obviously
has a strong preference for small languages: it would be interesting
to see his uncensored opinions of C++, the Godzilla of our day as Ada
and PL/I and Algol 68 were the Godzillas of theirs.  But from where we
stand now, A68 looks like a minizilla indeed, and has many interesting
ideas (notably structural equivalence).  It would need a few upgrades
to provide for subtyping and functional programming.

In might the Feanorians / that swore the unforgotten oath
brought war into Arvernien / with burning and with broken troth.
and Elwing from her fastness dim / then cast her in the waters wide,
but like a mew was swiftly borne, / uplifted o'er the roaring tide.
