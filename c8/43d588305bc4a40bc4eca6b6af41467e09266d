I think you're missing the joke.  But swtch () is a specific kernel
function in UNIX, though in this thread (excuse the pun) people seem
to be using it as a synonym for a scheduler.  And not many people need
to write their threading library by hand any more.

That's a different issue.  Any programmer worth his salt needs to
understand the underlying hardware, including stack frames.  For my
personal understanding of them, see
http://www.lemis.com/grog/Documentation/PUS/porting_unix_software/obj.pdf
towards the end, or http://www.lemis.com/grog/Papers/Debug-tutorial/
for the kernel context, page 17 on.

(gdb) bt

The real question is not to get a stack trace, but to analyse it.
