I used Debian everywhere (desktops, laptops, servers) both at work and
at home.  Until they decided to ship it with SystemD and don't give an
alternative.  I then switched to Devuan, and I can't be happier.  It's
the exact wonderful Debian experience, with the freedom of choice that
Debian always gave me until it didn't anymore.   I used to say I would
go back in a heart beat if it gave an init alternative to SystemD, but
I don't think I would anymore.

Me too, as well as for Haiku OS, even though it's not a UN!X derivative,
it's POSIX compliant (or so they claim), and it works very nicely as a
desktop OS.

Cheers,
