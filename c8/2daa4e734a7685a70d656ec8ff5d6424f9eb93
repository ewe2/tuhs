I'm almost certain it was MS who did the first x86 version of XENIX.

HCR did do some work with PDP-11 XENIX - notably Mike Tilson's RT-11
emulator, and I know there was some tie-in with Microsoft in the early
days but I'm not sure exactly what it was.

If HCR had been involved in the early XENIX x86 work I find it
incredible that nobody (including Tilson) ever mentioned it to
me when we (I was with SCO at the time) bought HCR back in the
early 90's.

If I can find Tilson I'll ask him if he remembers any of this.
