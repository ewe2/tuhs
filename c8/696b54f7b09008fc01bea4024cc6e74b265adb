Thanks!  (Don't know how I missed this. :-<)

Yes, it helped, and I'm now the proud owner of a (virtual) single-user V7 box.

Time to hack!

In the same rut as Andy Valencia:

I have tried booting the 2.11 BSD distribution that was in the boot images
directory, it has something like 9 disc pack images, and a script to boot it
with Supnik. Well, it boots all right, but I can't access most of the
filesystem, just the root, and even there most of the files seem corrupt. It
gets even worse when I try to shut it down. It will not even boot back up
after I shut it down in the emulator.

I think all the 2.11BSD disk images in Boot_Images are suspect.

I wonder if we could prevail upon Steven Schultz (or someone)
to build some 2.11BSD disk images which would be suitable for the
Supnik and Ersatz emulators.

I had some somewhere, but I haven't run them for a while.  They're
also very big.

I just acquired a MicroPDP-11 from a Goodwill a couple of days ago with a
RX50-A dual 400KB floppy and an RD52 31/33(?)MB hard drive, but it doesn't 
have a tape drive. My questions are:

1.) What UNIXes have been successfully loaded onto these types of machines?

2.) Can it be done without a tape? If so, has anybody pulled it off?

3.) Are there any utilities, either DOS or UNIX/Linux/FreeBSD based, to write
and/or format RX50 floppies?

I tried looking through the mail archive, but there didn't seem to be anything
there that addressed this question. Thanks in advance to everybody.

	Hmmm, I don't think they're corrupt.

	Wasn't there a similar posting a month or two ago about someone (I 
	forget who it was) having "massive corruption".   It turned out that
	the simulator was only told to use 256kb of memory (18bit mode).  Once
	the "set cpu 2048k" command was added to the conf file the problems
	cleared right up.   A good case can be made that it's a bug the system
	doesn't outright crash if it's unhappy with the amount of memory but
	given it's so easy to 'add memory' to the system I can't work up any
	enthusiasm to track down and fix the problem ;)

	Well, one could take the tape images that are in the archive and
	run the suitable tape preparation program ('makesimtape' for Supnik's
	simulator and I think makesimtape.c is around in the archive as well).
	Might need a "toggle in" boot for that (it's in the 2.11 setup and
	installation guide) though since I do not recall the Supnik simulator
	knowing how to boot from tape.

	Try putting "set cpu 2048k" (I don't _think_ you need both "set cpu
	22b" and "set cpu 2048k" but having both doesn't hurt and may help).

	I think we need just one more little piece of information before we
	can match up a version of Unix with your new machine.

	We need to know if it's an 11/23 (23+), or an 11/53 (73).   The 
	label "MicroPDP-11" was used on a number of systems.   If it's a 53
	or better then you can run any of the PDP-11 Unix systems that are
	out there.  If it's a 23 class machine then you're limited to V7
	or earlier (2.9BSD would probably fit but it would be a struggle and
	you definitely wouldn't be able to use the networking).

	Looking at the system maint register with the console ODT would
	probably be the easiest way to determine the cpu type - examine
	location 177750 (or 17777750 depending if the system needs the 
	explicit 22 bit address).  Bits 4 thru 7 tell the module type:
	5 = KDJ-11E (93, 94), 4 = KDJ-11D (53), 3 = KXJ11-C, 2 = KDJ11B
	(quad high 73), 1 = KDJ-11A (dual high board 73).   If it's a 23 the
	sys maint register probably doesn't exist.

	Another way would be to look at the module number on the spine of the
	card ;)

> 2.) Can it be done without a tape? If so, has anybody pulled it off?

	A ~32mb disk is going to be very tight for any 2BSD system.  V7 will
	fit I think.

> 3.) Are there any utilities, either DOS or UNIX/Linux/FreeBSD based, to write

	Hmmm, I thought John Wilson has some utilities that could do that.
	Normally you need to buy preformatted RX50 disks or have a DEC Rainbow
	(DOS) system around.

	On the other hand if the controller is an RQDX3 it is possible with
	some luck (and more hardware skill than I have ;)) hook up a standard
	5.25" Teac floppy drive.   I don't have the location of the info for
	that at hand - you might try the alt.sys.pdp11 or vmsnet.pdp-11 
	newsgroups (lots of knowing folks hang out there).

...contains a good FAQ with some useful links, including a link to
John Wilson's stuff at DBIT.

I'm also appending here a file with some informative messages on the
subject.  I had this file stored away with a bunch of Venix images for
the Pro.  I don't remember if this file (RX50.notes) came with the
Venix stuff, or if I collected them together myself.  I'm pretty sure
it's the former, but I couldn't find any links to it by searching the
net.  Anyway, here it is...

I use the 2.11_rp_unknown (Current Patch Level: 400, Date: January 24,
1998) image without any problems.  Well, I didn't know the root
password, so I had to erase it in single user mode.

That was probably me.

This is the script I use:

set cpu 22b
set cpu 3072K
at rp0 2.11_rp_unknown
at rl0 x.tar
b rp
