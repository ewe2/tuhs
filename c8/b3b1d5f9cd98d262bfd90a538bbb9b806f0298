For some daft reason my first foray onto the Unix command line was tcsh, 
and later I switched to bash, which is still my primary choice - though I 
don't mind using any other Korn-type shell, long as I got my "emacs 
editing" mode (although the real ksh's tab completion is clunkier than 
bash's).

Using a Bourne shell that doesn't have a line editor is a pain in the 
keester, but if I must, I can deal.

I have no idea how to use csh, and if I'm set up with csh as my default 
shell the first thing I'll do is try to switch it to bash or ksh!

-uso.
