I saw that the 4.3BSD distribution of the User Contributed Software 
contained the B progamming language & environment from Stichting 
Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam. It is "the Mark1C implementation of B 
for Unix(c) systems." But now I see that is not the same B:

	B is a simple but powerful new programming language, designed 
	for use in personal computing. (Note: the name ``B'' is only a 
	temporary working title, and the new language bears no relation 
	to the predecessor of C.)
