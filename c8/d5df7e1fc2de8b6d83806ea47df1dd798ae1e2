There's also USENET groups that had bug fixes for different versions
of Unix posted to them. comp.bugs.misc leaps to mind. I recall at least
some v7 bug fixes were posted there. Google's interface is kinda lame,
so I couldn't search it very well for v6 bugs, but there were maybe a
dozen or so v7 patches dating from the late 1980's. While not
as convenient as a fix tape, there may be something there of interest.
