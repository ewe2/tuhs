Also, 8th edition was essentially a re-port of 4.1c BSD, correct? If it
were already in BSD, it could conceivably come back into 8th edition via
that route. I found the following in /usr/src/sys/sys/TODO for 4.0BSD:

6. Exec fixes

That would strongly imply that the feature originated with Dennis and was
known in Berkeley around the time for 4BSD.

4.0's 'getxfile()' in /usr/src/sys/sys/sys1.c does not recognize the '#!'
sequence as a magic number, but 'exece()' in /usr/src/sys/newsys/sys1.c
does. No mention of it came up in my cursory scan of 3bsd. So it was
certain present by the time of 4.1c, but not before 4BSD that I found.
