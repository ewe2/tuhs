ANTS was written by Gary Grossman and the experience with ANTS and ANTS 2 was the direct inspiration for NCP Unix (which was probably what Mike installed):

> While Mike and I still shared an office in 394, the ENIAC room was where the IMP 29 on the ARPANET was and a PDP-11/40 system that ran a terminal server called ANTS (ArpaNet Terminal Server) complete with little ants silkscreened on the rack tops. When the ARPANET went to long leaders, Mike replaced that software with a UNIX host giving the BRL their real first HOST on the Arpanet. Years later I recycled those racks (discarding the 11/40) to hold BRL Gateways (retaining the ants).
