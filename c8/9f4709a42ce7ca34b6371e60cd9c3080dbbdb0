In my first job, around 1976, I hand-carried an RK05 from New Jersey
to Kansas City.  It was full of my employer's proprietary software,
which I was to install.  The laternative was to bring a huge pile of
floppies, which didn't seem sensible.

I was able to convince the airline security of those days that they
could neither open the RK nor X-ray it, but when it got there, it was
unreadable anyway.  My colleague took the next flight, with the huge
pile.
