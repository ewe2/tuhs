Or, for something really wierd...., how about porting 32V to
the modern VAXen, such as the scsi 3000 or 4000 class
machines?  x86 is nice, and good to do because of its
generic ubiquity, but somehow it ought to roll again on
something, VAX, too.....(:+}}... just for usable posterity.
How much of a chore would it be to port from say an
Ultrix box?  The tool chain should be basically intact.
Mebbie it is time to dust off our old VAX 3000 M38 crates.

There I go thinking out loud...., again.....
