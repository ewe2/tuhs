Well, naturally. My point is to wonder whether that was in spite of the
language.

That would be an interesting exercise, albeit a bit far afield from TUHS,
but perhaps the relevance is that one point Pascal and C were rivals for
marketshare (or so it seemed to me early on). Surely, C and Unix were
influenced by other competing technologies of the time.
