Good one!

And there was a pretty funny fake Exxx error code - I think it was
"EMACS - Editor too big"?


I was never happy with the size of EMACS, and it had nothing to do with the
amount of memory resources used. That big a binary implies a very large amount
of source, and the more lines of code, the more places for bugs... And it
makes it harder to understand, for someone working on it (to make a
change/improvement).
