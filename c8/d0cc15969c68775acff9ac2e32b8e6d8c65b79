This bit from the middle of sys/dev/tty.c seems to indicate that you
escape it with \:

	} else {
		mc = maptab[c];
		if (c==tp->t_erase || c==tp->t_kill)
			mc = c;
		if (mc && (mc==c || (tp->t_flags&LCASE))) {
			if (bp[-2] != '\\')
			c = mc;
			bp--;
		}
	}

On my test v7 system if I type backslash control-h:

	# stty
	speed 0 baud
	erase = '^H'; kill = '^U'
	even -nl echo -tabs
	# echo \^H | od -c
	0000000  \b  \n
	0000002
	#
