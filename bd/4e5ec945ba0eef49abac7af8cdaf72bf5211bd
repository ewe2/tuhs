Subject: Hello and thanks!
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10005251459360.7072-100000@guildenstern.shaffstall.com>

After about a week of work (mainly due to a dying RA81 ... see below), I
have successfully installed 2.11BSD on my 11/83. First and foremost,
thanks to a) Steven M. Shultz for so carefully maintaining and updating
(!) CSRG's PDP-11 code to work with hardware such as my MSCP drives and
TMSCP TK50 and b) everyone involved in prodding SCO to release free
Ancient UNIX source licenses.

After dealing with a crippled binary-only Micro/RSX lack-of-a-kit, and as
a FreeBSD user of five-odd years, I decided to bite the bullet and see
what UNIX was/is like on a PDP. Thanks to the work of Steven and a cast of
thousands, it's pretty damned impressive.

The only problems I've been having seem to be coming from disk controllers
without media. More specifically, I get a hard error, followed by an
endless loop of error indications if I try to access one of my RX50s (on
an RQDX3 controller), and the only recourse is a reset. Okay, so the
solution here is simple: don't do it. The bigger problem comes with my
flake-job of an RA81, which, FWIW, is the only fixed disk storage I have.
It has a strange habit: the "A" light goes off and the controller can no
longer access it. If I soft-restart the PDP (under either RSX or UNIX),
the driver connects back to the drive without a glitch. And this gives me
the same loop-of-errors syndrome as an empty RX50. Anyone have any
pointers or sage advice? I figured I may try to modify the MSCP driver to
re-init the controller on a hard error, and try again. But the MSCP code
is fairly complicated, and I know nothing of the protocol. Anyone have any
MSCP documentation which I could beg, borrow, or steal? I'd give the
specific error codes, but I haven't written any down yet and I'm at work.

Also, I am willing to provide a Good Home for any 19" rackmount MSCP
drives in the midwest. Let me rephrase that: any one or two; I have a one
bedroom apartment, and I'm saving a bit of floorspace for a (yet to
materialize) VAX. Also Qbus thinnet or SCSI would be nice, whilst on cloud
780...

TIA,
jasomill

After reading the _entire_ archive of PUPS messages, and realizing that,
no, I'm not crazy and, no, I'm not the only one still interested in old
hardware and software, I dug up two old 16-bit UNIX distributions and
promptly archived 'em. Unfortunately, they're binary only and System-V
based, so I can't just throw 'em in the archive. But when the game is up
on the System-V codebase, I hope these CD-Rs are still around. They are:
	- SCO XENIX 286 2.2, complete OS with development system and text
processing ([tn]roff, etc)
	- Microport System V/AT Development System (runtimes say both 1.3
and 2.3, development stuff says 1.3 - don't know, never booted this one)

All the floppies read without errors, and I've actually booted and run the
XENIX (used it for a tape conversion job a couple years ago) - works as
long as you have a 5.25" floppy drive and reasonably old hardware - I ran
it on a 386 but it doesn't grok VGA.

Also, I have the ability to write TK50 tapes along with a wide range of
other formats (my employer makes tape conversion equipment and software);
no TK25 (unless the old IBM Tandberg VarBlock format is identical - don't
know) or TK70, but just about anything else (need PDP UNIX on an HP 9144A 
cartridge tape; a) why? and b) I can help*!). I'd be happy to cut PDP UNIX
tapes for media and shipping.

Finally, anyone ever used the mtools package to read MS-DOS disks from an
RX50 from a DEC Rainbow? I'm working on it (no Rainbow, but I've got a box
that writes Rainbow disks) and I'd be glad to help anyone interested; I'm
also working on R/W RX50 on FreeBSD.

* but not much, unless someone is willing to replace the rubber roller
thingy on my HP drive, but, as usual, I digress.

Hi all,
	I'm just doing some house cleaning on the PUPS Archive. I've
forgotten who uploaded these into the incoming directory?

As well, can you supply a README saying what is in these files, too :-)

My memory isn't what it used to me.

Hi all,
	Since the free SCO license, we've had an enormous demand on our
PUPS volunteers. If there is anybody in Japan who can burn CDs, could you
contact me if you are prepared to burn a few copies of the PUPS CD.

I've made a start on tidying up the archive & moving recently donated
things to appropriate directories. Are there other systems out there
which could be donated to the archive? I've just have a Z8000 SystemIII
system being donated.

I'm happy to take donations, but they may not be moved into the main
archive because I don't want to have my butt sued off.

Ages ago, George Colouris at QMC in the UK had a 9-track tape containing
QED, the visual Unix editor which influenced the development of vi. Can
anybody in the UK read 9-tracks. If so, I'll put you in contact with George.

Cheers,
	Warren

The port-vax at netbsd.org list is full of very VAX clueful people.

Everything necessary to emulate one in software.  I have Supnik's

	Do you also have Harti Brandt's P11 ("Begemot") emulator?  That
	is a _work of art_!   Has an emulated DEQNA so you can place the
	"PDP-11" on a LAN, the timeskew problem has been fixed (the emulated
	pdp-11 keeps good time), and it also has a TOY clock now.

	Check out http://www.begemot.org

Yes. port-vax is the right audience. (I am part of it. ;-)  )

There is an excellent site with information about VAX hardware. 
http://www.vaxarchive.org/hw/index.html
mirror at
http://vaxarchive.sevensages.org/hw/index.html

There you can find a link to the KA630/MicroVAX II page
http://www.telnet.hu/hamster/dr/ka630.html
This will answer most of your questions. 

If you want a modern Unix OS look at www.netbsd.org.

Well, I keep calling the hardware support folks, and it keeps ringing
busy. Of course, since I don't have call waiting or voice mail, that is to
be expected :) I've actually thought about trying to acquire an
MSCP<->SCSI card and using one of the SCSI drives I have lying around, but
the 19" rackmount stuff is too cool (unfortunately, my spares cabinet is
full of dirty laundry and ruined CD-R media at the moment), though I
suppose an RA92 would suffice (anybody got one? :) though my budget is
henceforth nonexistant -- $300 wouldn't break the bank, because they
wouldn't give it to me. Don't know about the RQDX3, either, but more
likely the KDA50 (which drives my RA81 -- the RQDX3 is for RXen, no more).

The '81 was up all last night, so I don't have error numbers yet; I'll try
to repeat the RX50 problem sometime this weekend. The only FS, I have, is
yours, though I've started reading through it. Though the SCSI spec is
thousands of pages long, it's pretty easy to program; I just finished some
raw-tape-read routines for Hewlett-Packard CS/80 tape drives, that was
even simpler. In both cases, however, I do have documentation
(exhaustive documentation in re: SCSI -- again, work related). I take it
from your reply that such docs aren't to be had for MSCP? At any price?

Sender: owner-pups at minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au

Hello Seth,

I never worked with a real PDP-11. I tried to build a V7 Boot tape for 
the Supnick and still did not succeed, but I got the following impressions:

 * V7 Doc says, You can't use the bootstrap from the DEC bulk ROM,
   but need to key in a custom bootstrap. Have a look into
   the V7 Manual Volume 2B (Essay about Installing UNIX).

 * It seems, a tape also needs to contain labels for the files
   (512 Byte Records), kind of directory.

---------------------------------
Hello folks,

I'm trying to build a 2.11BSD boot tape for Bob Supnik's emulator.  I
downloaded the tape files from Distributions/ucb/2.11BSD, and put them
together with the following commands (on Linux):

  cat mtboot mtboot boot | dd of=file0 obs=512
  dd if=disklabel of=file1 obs=1024
  dd if=mkfs of=file2 obs=1024
  dd if=restor of=file3 obs=1024
  dd if=icheck of=file4 obs=1024
  dd if=root.dump of=file5 obs=10240
  dd if=file6.tar of=file6 obs=10240
  dd if=file7.tar of=file7 obs=10240
  dd if=file8.tar of=file8 obs=10240
  cat file? > boot.tape  [I've verified the shell expands this
                          expression to the correct file order]

But when I run the simulator and try to boot from the tape (with or
without the -o optiont to 'boot'), it fails, like so:

  % pdp11

  PDP-11 simulator V2.3d
  sim> set cpu 18b
  sim> set cpu 2048K
  sim> att tm0 boot.tape
  sim> boot tm0

  HALT instruction, PC: 000002 (HALT)
  sim> boot -o tm0

  HALT instruction, PC: 000002 (HALT)
  sim>

It's like the bootstrap code isn't working.  Or possibly I've completely
misunderstood the proper way to build a tape image.  Is there a better
way to go about it?

	Not exactly.  The boot tape consists of files with different block
	sizes but has no "labels".

	So close yet so far.

	You do not need to "reblock" the files - they already have the correct
	sizes.  What you do need to do is run a program to add the record
	length information for the emulator.  The emulator needs to have
	"virtual" file and record mark information added.

	If you look in the "usr/src/sys/pdpstand" directory you will find
	a source file "makesimtape.c".  This is a slightly modified version
	of the 'maketape' program which 2.11 uses to create its own boot tapes.
	The modifications consist of changes to add the virtual tape marks
	for Bob's emulator.

	I will include a copy of makesimtape.c below in case anyone has trouble
	finding it in the source tree.

	makesimtape should compile on almost anything (I've used it on
	2.11BSD, BSD/OS, and I think FreeBSD).  Compile that program.  Then
	create a small file (maketape.data) containing:

mtboot 1
mtboot 1
boot 1
* 1
disklabel 2
* 1
mkfs 2
* 1
restor 2
* 1
icheck 2
* 1
root.dump 20
* 1
file6.tar 20
* 1
file7.tar 20
* 1
file8.tar 20
*1

	Then "makesimtape -i maketape.data -o your_tape_file" will create
	the virtual tape file in 'your_tape_file'.

	Actually to make sure things work (and the tape is bootable and can
	run the standalone programs) all you need are the files up thru
	root.dump - that is enough to load the root filesystem.  


	With a real tape drive you use the "maketape" program that comes
	with 2.11 of course since it wants to issue ioctl calls to place
	real tape marks, etc on a tape.

	Hopefully the method described above will be closer to what's
	needed.  it has been quite a while since I've actually created a
	simulated tape so I might have left out a step or something.

	Good Luck!
