Not just that, but the aerodynamics have been screwed up.  The heads will 
no longer "float" on an air-cushion; I believe the gap is the traditional 
human hair width, if that.

Trivia: there is a small NiCd battery in the RK-05 drive which has to be 
replaced every so often; its sole job is to drag those heads back in the 
event of a power failure, whether it was writing at the time or not.
