Subject: [TUHS] [ off topic ] Looking for old versions of mawk ...
Message-ID: <201609171917.u8HJHowG004239@skeeve.com>

Hi All.

I'm looking for old tarballs of mawk. Specifically all versions of
mawk 1.2 and mawk 1.3 prior to 1.3.2.  I found a 1.3.2 tarball on the
net (not sure how authentic it is ; if you have a real one, please let
me know) and I have 1.3.3.

Much thanks,

Arnold Robbins
