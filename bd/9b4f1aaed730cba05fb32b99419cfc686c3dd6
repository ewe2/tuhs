Um, bzzzzt.  Wrong.  I have a floppy labeled:  BL-FN7AP-MC CZFNAP0 M-11 
FORMTR RX50  .  This is a formatter program for a Micro PDP-11.

It is a *diagnostic* program (not a user program) for formatting these 
beasties.  Mine is for the -11, I would imagine that there is one for the 
MicroVAX as well.

Of course, it is copyrighted.
