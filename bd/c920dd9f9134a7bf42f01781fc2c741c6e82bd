All,

I did my research on this, but it's still a bit fuzzy (why is it that 
people's memories from 40 years ago are so malleable?).

1. What are y'all's recollections regarding BSD 4.1's releases, vis a 
vis the VAX. In McKusick's piece, Twenty Years of Berkeley Unix, I get 
one perspective, and from Sokolov's Quasijarus project, I get quite 
another. In terms of popularity and in terms of stable performance, what 
say you? Was 4.1 that much better than 4BSD? Was 4.1as obsolete 
immediately as McKusick says? 4.1b sounds good with FFS, was it? 4.1c's 
the last pre 4.2 release, but it sounds like it was nearly a beta 
version of 4.2...

2. Sokolov implies that the CSRG mission started going off the rails 
with the 4.3/4.3BSD-Tahoe and it all went pear shaped with the 4.3-Reno 
release, and that Quasijarus puts the mission back on track, is that so?

3. I've gotten BSD 4.2 and BSD 4.3 releases built from tape and working 
very well. I just can't decide whether to go back to one of the 4.x 
releases (hence question 1), or go get Quasijarus0c - thoughts on why 
one might be more interesting than another?

4. Is Quasijarus0c end of the line for VAX 4.xBSD? Why does tuhs only 
have Quasijarus0 and 0a, was there something wrong with 0b and 0c?

5. Has anyone unearthed an original 4.1 tape, or is Haertel's 
reconstruction of the 1981 tape 1 release as close as it gets?

Later,

Will
