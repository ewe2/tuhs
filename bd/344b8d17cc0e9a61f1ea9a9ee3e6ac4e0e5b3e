For those that are familiar with the RISC V architecture, there's a
formal specification of the architecture that was done in a system
built on Coq, and also a fully formally verified translation of the
specification into RTL. (The spec didn't include floating point as of
about a year ago but it may by now.)

A good overview of the system involved is here:

Followups might belong on the coff list, not sure.
