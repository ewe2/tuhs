Although, I was also under  the impression that Maxwell had taken the term from ideas from some his Cambridge colleagues that were working on human thought and described the ideas of these daemons running around in your head supporting things like vision, hearing and your other senses.   The later was formalized I believe years later by Oliver Suthridge (IIRC my Cog Psych of many years ago) - into the something like the Pandemonium model of cognition.

This origin must've been better known 30+ years back because I
remembered this as well. To check I first looked at the Wikipedia
entry for Maxwell's demons (I learned new facts but also confused
myself as I couldn't see the connection).

As to where Maxwell got his demons, see
https://archive.org/stream/lifescientificwo00knotuoft#page/212/mode/2up
and page 214 as well:

  Maxwell constructed the following Catechism:
  
    "Concerning demons.
    "1. Who gave them this name? Thomson
    "2. What were they by nature? Very small BUT lively beings incapable of 
        doing work but also able to open and shut valves which move without
        friction or inertia.
    etc.

Yes, Kirk McKusick who actually drew the original BSD daemon with purple sneakers, was wearing the infamous blue tee with said logo out walking on the street, as one someone else in the party (maybe Sam Leffler) sporting a 10 anniversary USENIX shirt in San Antonio many years ago, which has the daemons shown top of a PDP-11 with pipes, the null device, et al.   He has quite a tale of the experience.

BSD's daemon is much cuter than that damned nemesis of Batman :-)
