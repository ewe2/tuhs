Microsoft's developers had a "hook and hack" mentality with regard to
the OS.  This goes back to the days of DOS, when once your application
started, you could do anything you pleased, as long as you put the OS
kernel back to its clean state before you exited.  Dave Cutler fought
tooth and nail against any attempts to insert hooks in the NT
microkernel, or to muddle the layered design.  But after Dave left
day-to-day NT development, things got muddied up.
