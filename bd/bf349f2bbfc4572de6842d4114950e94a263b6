I don't know if this was just me, but the inner geek in me first thought
was  "How did the pictures turn out"? :-)
(the second thought was "Joe is now a hero to me" even thought I didn't
meet him... and this sounds sooo much like what
I've done with other geeky friends in college,  etc... ).

An example today, I got a Bluetooth water bottle (as part of a reward for
something at work)
and when I set it up it needed a firmware update, which I thought was cool
(and my wife just rolled her eyes...). :-)

<br>
echo 1 was a 100 foot balloon that was<br>
launched into space=C2=A0 in the early 60s. this<br>
was the first satellite that was easily visible<br>
to the naked eye.<br>
<br>
joe wrote a set of fortran programs that<br>
tracked the orbit of echo and calculated<br>
the direction to look from a point on earth.<br>
to do this, he had to learn fortran and<br>
orbital dynamics.<br>
<br>
the programs were used to point antennas<br>
to send emf from california. bouncing off<br>
echo and received at bell labs in<br>
new jersey. thus, thanks to joe, echo was<br>
the first communications satellite.<br>
<br>
by the time i came to bell labs (1966) the<br>
program, azel, for azimuth/elevation, was<br>
expanded to track planets, moons, satellites,<br>
etc. moreover, it tracked the shadow of the<br>
earth cast by the sun (night). it could predict<br>
within a few seconds when echo would wink<br>
on or off as it passed through the shadow.<br>
<br>
a version of azel was maintained all the time<br>
i was at bell labs. we used it to predict<br>
eclipses, transits, occultations etc. when<br>
we first got a voice synthesizer, the day&#39;s<br>
predictions were spoken at 5pm in case<br>
there was anything interesting.<br>
<br>
anyway, at 5pm on june 8, 1983 the voice<br>
announced an &quot;occultation of mercury&quot;<br>
for early the next morning.<br>
<br>
no one had heard of such a thing. it was<br>
extremely rare. mercury had to be at<br>
about its max elongation; the moon had<br>
to be only a few hours old (or young);<br>
it had to be dark; the moon and mercury<br>
had to be above the horizon; and lastly,<br>
the moon had to occult mercury.<br>
<br>
we all (me, lee mcmahon, dennis ritchie,<br>
rob pike, and bob morris) frantically tried<br>
to verify that it was real. it was, but it<br>
would only be about 5 degrees above<br>
the horizon facing right into new york city.<br>
not a chance. we all went home.<br>
<br>
later that night we were writing to each<br>
other and calculating that in an airplane<br>
at 10,000 feet, the event moved up to 10<br>
or 15 degrees above the horizon. also,<br>
in an airplane, we could avoid nyc.<br>
<br>
so at 3am, we (me, rob pike, rae mclellan)<br>
went to the airport equipped with cameras<br>
and binoculars. we flew north as high as the<br>
plane would go. we might be the only<br>
people in the world who have seen an<br>
occultation of mercury. thank you joe.<br>
