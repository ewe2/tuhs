I=E2=80=99m looking for the end-to-end datakit network protocol as it =
existed in 7th Edition.

Context is as follows:

- The Spider network guaranteed reliable, in-order delivery of packets =
at the TIU interface. There does not seem to have been a standard host =
end-to-end protocol, although applications did of course contain sanity =
checks (see for instance the =E2=80=98nfs=E2=80=99 source here: =
http://chiselapp.com/user/pnr/repository/Spider/tree?ci=3Dtip)

- Datakit dropped the reliable delivery part (although it did retain the =
in-order guarantee) and moved this responsibility to the host. It is the =
(early) evolution of the related protocol that I=E2=80=99m trying to dig =
up.

- 7th Edition appears to have had a (serial line based) Datakit =
connection. Datakit drivers are not in the distributed files, but its =
tty.h file has defines for several Datakit related  constants. Also, as =
the first Datakit switches became operational at Murray Hill in =E2=80=997=
8 or =E2=80=9979, it seems a reasonable assumption that the Research =
code base included drivers & protocols for it around that time.

- After that the trail continues with the 8th edition which has a stream =
filter (dkp.c) for the =E2=80=9CNew Datakit Protocol=E2=80=9D: =
http://chiselapp.com/user/pnr/repository/v8unix/artifact/01b4f6f05733aba5 =
 This suggests that there was an =E2=80=9COld Datakit Protocol=E2=80=9D =
as well - if so, this may have been the protocol in use at the time of =
7th Edition.

The =E2=80=9CNew Datakit Protocol=E2=80=9D appears to be (more or less) =
the same as what was later called URP (Universal Receiver Protocol). At =
the time of Plan9 its IL/IP protocol appears to have been designed as an =
equivalent for URP/Datakit. The early protocols where apparently =
(co-)designed by Greg Chesson and maybe also stood at the base of his =
later XTP protocol work.

Any recollections about the early history and evolution of this Datakit =
protocol are much appreciated. Also, if the source to the 7th Edition =
Datakit network stack survived I=E2=80=99d love to hear.
