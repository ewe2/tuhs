Thanks, Warren, for the (brief) posting of the ePub file for Peter
Salus' fine book, A Quarter Century of Unix.

I have a printed copy of that book on my shelf, and here is a list of
the errata that I found in it when I read it in 2004 that might also
be present in the ePub version:

p. 23, line 7:
	deveoloped -> developed

p. 111, line 5:
	Dave Nowitz we'd do -> Dave Nowitz said we'd do

p. 142, line 7:
	collaboaration -> collaboration

p. 144, line -4 (i.e., 4 from bottom):
	reimplemeted -> reimplemented

p. 160, line 10:
	the the only -> the only

p. 196, line 17:
	develope JUNET -> develop JUNET

p. 221, running header:
	Berkley -> Berkeley

p. 222, line 11:
	Mellon Institue -> Mellon Institute
