I hacked a terminal emulator to look like it once.
Fired up the browser running javascript, running jor1k,
running linux, running simh, running a v6 install.
http://dugo.home.xs4all.nl/ksr33.png for the result.

I kept the pipes that shouldn't be there on a
standard print head. Speed was controlled by
simh settings.

I reverted to the standard jor1k emulator for
the v6 demo[1] because I have no experience or
other reference for exactly how a KSR-33
exactly works and lacked the bandwidth to
even implement overstrike.

I saw one in a contest that emulated the sounds
and the moving parts at:

watch out, it is slow and runs on a limited set
of browsers.
