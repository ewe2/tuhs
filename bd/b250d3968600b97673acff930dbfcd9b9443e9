But east postive is an artifact of north up.  I remember Australian
souvenir shops selling maps on "MacQuarrie's corrective projection",
in which south is up.  In fact this orientation was not uncommon in
Europe between medieval maps that really were oriented, with east up,
and later convention that put north up and shoved Australia down under.

Surely an Aussie would prefer south up and west positive!
