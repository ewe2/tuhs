Hi Larry.

Illumos is at least one continuation of Open Solaris after Oracle pulled
the plug on it. There are others.  It looks to me like an aim is to
fill the Enterprise OS slot.  I think many now-former Sun / Solaris kernel
guys are working on it.

I have not messed with it myself, I'm pretty happy running Linux
these days, but if you want the Enterprise features there (zFS, zones,
whatever else), it's probably worth looking into.

That's about all I know - people with more experience with it should
chime in. :-)
