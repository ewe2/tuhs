Back when MIT Project Athena was using Vax/750's as time sharing
machines (before the advent of the MicroVax II workstations and AFS),
students were assigned to a Vax 750, and were given a quota of I think
a megabyte, at least initially.  It could be increased by applying to
the user accounts office.  Given that there were roughly 4,000
undergraduates sharing 5 or 6 Vax/750's, it was somewhat understandable...
