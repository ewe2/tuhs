Most of the PDP stuff has long since been surplussed, and I have trolled
the local newsfeeds but nothing seems to turn up.  VAXen are the usual
fare, since PDP's were not that common around here.  The RTP NC area did
not really get big into computering until the VAX era.

I fell into a MVII yesterday that has a Dilog controller.  Is that the
one you are talking about?  If so, that could be a lucky find.

Here's a crazy, but possible thought.... can I write 211BSD drives from
a MicroVAX II and move the card/drives over to the PDP-11 and have a
reasonable expectation that they will work, or at least boot to a root
or a miniroot or such?  It is a long shot, but if I am just dd'ing
images, it might work, I would think.

One of my goals with the MVII is to use it to write 9 track tapes, IFF
I can lay hands on one of several 9 trackkers in surplus in the next
few weeks.  They were originally used on a local VAXsystem 5400 crate
and are single ended scsi Ciphers.  Could they be used on a PDP-11, too?

I have plenty of the RZ55/56/57/58ish things that have popped up in
surplus that I am using on my VAXstation toyz.  All the PeeCee types
avoid them like the plague, and I truck them out by the handfull.
MooU was big on those and DS5000/200 crates.  They are now hitting
surplus quite frequently.

I had one of those, too, a few months back, but stripped the MVI it came
out of, without thinking of hanging onto that card.  Minus two points for
me.  Someone else was lucky that day.....(:+}}...

I have half a dozen of these early Sun drives in storage, so that is
good to know, and I did save the 650mb esdi drive from the MVI, thinking
I could use it on a Sun, but never got around to it.

RD53 is a Micropolis 1375 (eh, no the MFM variant of it.. 75 is SCSI.
Maybe 1325??).

RD54 is a Maxtor or Newbury data drive.
 
I can look up the details if needed. As far as MFM drives go I would not
consider anything smaller than a 53.

Oh, stupid me... I cleaned up the junk pile a couple of months back
and not thinking threw out about 20 of these mfm critters, not thinking
they were much usable, any more.  I did save a couple of the 150mb
mfm things from the Sun3 crate, though.  They were Micropolis, if
memory is correct.  All the 20/30/40/60/80mb things I chucked.
Oh well.

On the ESDI drives, has anyone tried the IBM things from Model 60
and Model 80 machines?  They were 70/115/300mb drives, and are
quite common.  If they were usable, I have bunches of those that
have not yet been thrown out.  They are also quite numerous in
local surplus.

I am using Micropolis 1654-7 (150MB), 1664-7 (320MB) and Maxtor XT4380
(350MB) ESDI drives from PCs and Apollo Domain DN3X00 Machines with a
Dilog DQ686 QBus MSCP controller. Last week I salvaged a XT4780 (~700MB)
but did not have the time to test it. I had no problems using this
disks. After reformating them with the controller on board diag they
worked well in my MicroVAX II. I expect no problems with it when I
convert the VAX to a PDP11/23. 
The problem with some IBM PS/2 ESDI drives is the proprietary
connector, that combinates signal and power lines in one connector.
I don't know if they are usable with a normal ESDI controller. On the
other hand: In my PS/2 80 is the same Maxtor XT4380 like the one from
Apollo I am using with the Dilog.
