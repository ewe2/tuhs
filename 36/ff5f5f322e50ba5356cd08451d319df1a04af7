Those type of drives used a floppy interface but didn't look like a  
floppy. If I remember right, the seek signal was a data clock and the  
seek direction signal was the out data. I don't remember the in data.  
The other signals were ignored.

You sent command blocks to the tape drive by sending a series of seek  
requests that caused the command block to be encoded on the seek/seek  
direction pins. The you would toggle the seek pin and read the input  
pin to read the response.
