Please, forgive me. I profusely apologize for all the inconveniences. It's
been fixed now.

I am sorry, I have been busy with lectures and travels and had forgotten the
issue until I finally found time tonight to re-check TUHS on this account.
Be assured I blushed when I saw my mistake and it has been the first thing 
I've done.

I'll try not to leave TUHS for so long again. Promise.
