Hello folks,<br>
<br>
I realized I should mention this here on TUHS, since it is likely of<br>
interest to at least some of you!<br>
<br>
I recently wrote a DMD 5620 emulator, currently available on Linux and<br>
Macintosh, with Windows support coming soon. Here&#39;s a brief demo of the=
<br>
Mac version:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 <a href=3D"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DtcSWqBmAMeY" rel=
=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DtcSWqBm=
AMeY</a><br>
<br>
I wrote it because DMD 5620s are becoming incredibly rare, and showing<br>
them off in person is quite difficult nowadays.<br>
<br>
This emulator is using ROM version 2.0 (8;7;5) dumped from my personal<br>
5620. If anyone out there has a DMD 5620 with an older ROM, I would be<br>
incredibly grateful if you could dump the ROMs. I&#39;d like to find<br>
versions of 1.x (8;7;3 or earlier); so far I&#39;ve had no luck.<br>
<br>
The main reason I&#39;m interested in older ROMs, besides pure preservation=
<br>
reasons, is that the &#39;mux&#39; and &#39;muxterm&#39; system on Research=
 UNIX V8/V9<br>
is hard-coded for the 1.1 ROMs. It doesn&#39;t work with the emulator<br>
without significant tweaking of the source. It DOES work perfectly well<br>
with the DMD Core Utilities package for the AT&amp;T 3B2, however.<br>
<br>
All the best!<br>
