Solbourne computer produced OS/MP, which was a SMPized version of
SunOS 4.1. It scaled to at least 16 CPUs. Userland was 100% compatible
with SunOS at the given revision level.  My team (the OI group) was
part of Solbourne for a while, so we got much of that gear when we
were spun out to ParcPlace. Our main build server had 12 CPUs, and it
was nice being able to do make -j 16. cfront was, for its time, quite
the pig. Now it's lightyears faster than clang, though produces lousy
code... OS/MP ran on hardware that was 50MHz SuperSparc CPUs and could
be configured up to 14 CPUs and a whopping 256MB of RAM...
