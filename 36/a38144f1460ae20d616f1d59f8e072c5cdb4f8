Subject: [Unix-jun72] Import V1 filesystem trees into svn?
Message-ID: <20080506023814.GA21907@minnie.tuhs.org>

I think it would be a good idea to import the V1 / and /usr filesystem from
the s2 tape into the subversion repository, so that we can write a tools/
script to build "known good" rf0.dsk and rk1.dsk disk images.

In my private tree I have 1root/ and 1usr/, but perhaps we should have
something like fs/root/ and fs/usr. They need to be split so that my
mkfs tool can build separate disk images.

Comments?
