I should try and locate whatever document I have that says DECstation as 
well. Fun, if nothing else.

Sortof. The File system in COS is weird. It do have an sortof OS/8 
compatible file system for the system area, with the different date 
base. But it's not clear if OS/8 would actually be able to read it, as 
the layout of the whole disk is different. COS divide the disk into 
segments, and allocates a bunch of those for the system area, and then 
use the other segments to implement data files.

COS also shares the format of .SV files with OS/8. But I doubt any OS/8 
binary would run under COS. (Well, maybe something that did not use any 
device drivers or USR.)

Not entirely. Like I said above, COS has a weird layout of mass storage, 
where you have logical files, which are just numbered. And that is how 
most of the mass storage is used. And those files can also be converted, 
and the transfer program deals with that. In addition, I am not sure 
that OS/8 would be able to figure out any COS disk, since I'm not so 
sure the actual location of the directory files and the data is the same 
between them. So even though the directory format itself is the same, 
that is not necessarily enough to be able to exchange disks.

But yes, in addition, text is also encoded in a different way in COS 
text files.

Glad we got that sorted. Sorry for the confusion.
