Yeah, I've often wondered why this stuff wasn't exposed.  We already have
signal handlers, seems like that maps.  

I tried to get the NFS guys at Sun to rethink the biod junk and do it like
UFS does, where it queues something and gets a callback.  I strongly suspect
that two processes, one to queue, one to handle callbacks, would be more
efficient and actually faster than the biod nonsense.

That's one of the arguments I lost unfortunately.

Warner, exposing that stuff in FreeBSD is not really that hard, I suspect.
Might be a fun project for a young kernel hacker with some old dude like
you or me or someone, watching over it and thinking about the API.
