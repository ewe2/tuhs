It turns out CAS is used in many places in the source code of the 4K and 8K drum versions of the final IBM 704 FORTRAN II compiler. See http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/FORTRAN/index.html#Source_code; in particular:

Transcribed source: http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/FORTRAN/source/fortran-ii/fort1.asm.html
Assembly listing: http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/FORTRAN/source/fortran-ii/fort1.lst.html

I didnâ€™t try to figure out if this code generates CAS, but it certainly uses it.
