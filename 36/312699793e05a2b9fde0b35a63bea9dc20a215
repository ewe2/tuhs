I had to laugh.   A few months back I was working with a very bright 20 something engineers (from one of my alma mater's ) who is working on our new Xpoint memory technology.   I had to explain to him some of these new behaviors / inventions were how things like core memory worked as well as showing him some info on the ML11 with exactly these type of features.   He had no idea.  

While I'm not part of the the Xpoint team I have no idea what will end up as exposed features in final product  or how people configure them but it's interesting to watch some ideas that stopping being fashionable or maybe economical be (re)discovered. 

What is new is old and old is now newðŸ˜Ž
