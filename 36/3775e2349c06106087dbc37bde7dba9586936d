Hello from Gregg C Levine
Here's a comment from my side of the pond. Al Kossow has a great
collection of PDF files on the PDP-11. Right now I'm grabbing the ones
that discuss my current collection of problems. The location is
http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp11/ 
From that one, and behind it, sits his entire collection. But that
space is entirely the PDP-11.
