I'm betting the changes wouldn't be that hard.  /dev/tun is really
easy to use, and should only involve a few lines of change.

If you don't really need networking, but just want remote access,
you can set simh up to have multiple tty's that use listening
sockets on the local machine.  Then people can telnet in to the
machine, but will reach a tty instead of a telnetd/pty.  Of course
there would be no outgoing traffic allowed.
