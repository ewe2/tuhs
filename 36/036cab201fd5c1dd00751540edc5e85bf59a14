Subject: [TUHS] Had a crack at assembling the Unix v1 kernel
Message-ID: <CADxT5N4dN2VNd5npqWQ_1Gf75WiMaRxP7e_RKP+NxOzTSGJt2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Ok, I looked around for the instructions on how to assemble the Unix
v1 kernel and couldn't find anything so I tried:

as u0.s u1.s u2.s u3.s u4.s u5.s u6.s u7.s u8.s u9.s ux.s

and that made a.out and I stripped it and it looked like it was around
the same size as /etc/core (it was 16400 bytes rather than 16448 for
some reason).

I'm not sure where Unix v1 is loading the kernel from. I'm guessing
it's /etc/core and if that's the case then I must have been successful
building the kernel. In all the other versions of Unix there was
always a file like 'unix' in the root directory but I guess Unix v1
was different?
