Yes, we used MMDF quite extensively until TCP/IP.=20


I remember paying $800 for a network card for a PC in the mid 90's.=20


Just this week, I discarded a box filled with old 10/100 cards.=20

The Xenix communications manual has plenty of detail on how to set it up:=

Looks as if it built a routed network among a set of Xenix machines using=
