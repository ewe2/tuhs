If my memory is right, I would have talked to Dennis about it around
1987 or early 1988.  Is it possible that was before they did networking
in streams?  

Maybe I have the dates wrong but my guess is I talked to him about it 
before the networking stuff was done in research Unix.  So his view
may have evolved.
