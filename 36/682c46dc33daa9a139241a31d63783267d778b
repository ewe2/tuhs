The FORTRAN II arithmetic IF, with its three-way branch, was probably
introduced to facilitate use of the conditional branch instructions of
the IBM 704, which test the value of the accumulator and take a branch
accordingly:

    TMI (transfer on minus)
    TMP (transfer on plus)
    TZE (transfer on zero)
    TNZ (transfer on not zero)

It takes at most two of these instructions to implement the arithmetic IF.
