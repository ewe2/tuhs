I'd start with the last larry wall version of patch, before gnu took it up.
It likely will compile there out of the box. There's a copy in 2.11BSD
that's version 2 that at least fits into a PDP-11 with separate I&D space.
It's also on the 2.10.1BSD tape as well. configure will almost certainly
work on the V7 shell. Not sure about v6, unlikely. It will compile under
V7's c compiler as well, since it's pure K&R. It also runs well enough to
apply all the diffs 2.11BSD has produced over the years. It looks like it
doesn't require separate I&D space to load, but it's big enough that it
helps a lot. V7 had separate i&D space, so you're good there.

However, it will only accept context diffs, not unified diffs. You may have
to convert newer unified diffs to context diffs. Well, it also accepts
normal diffs and ed scripts too :)

Looking at the size of FreeBSD's patch, it's only 53kB text and 8kB data on
amd64, so there's a chance newer versions will fit (this is the last
BSD-licensed version, with bug fixes). It groks everything that gnu patch
groks. gnu patch is 175k of text and 8k of data and is quite likely a lost
cause on the pdp-11 (with overlays, 176k is the absolute max, but 150k is
where it gets hard... but V7 didn't have an overlay linker).
