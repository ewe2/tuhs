Certainly so. I don't know what the call-processing module ran, but on the 
Administration Module side it was real-time UNIX running on a 3B20D (D for 
Duplexed). I even have a bunch of source code for it on microfiche 
somewhere, although I probably should not admit to this.

When I lived in Philadelphia in the early 1990s Temple University tried to 
give me one of their 3B20S (S for Simplex) systems that was being 
decommissioned. The size of several refrigerators, lamentably, I was not 
able to give it a home. I hope it found one ..
