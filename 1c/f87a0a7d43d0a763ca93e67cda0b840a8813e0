Um, just an observation: u0.s defines:

core = orig+40000  / specifies beginning of user's core
ecore = core+20000 / specifies end of user's core (4096 words)

so a user program has 020000 bytes of space; but size /usr/lib/c0 gives:

023326+03574+06640=035762, and 035762 >> 020000.

Is the value of ecore arbitrary? What's above ecore, the kernel stack?
Mind you, if we set ecore== 040000+035762, thats 075762 which doesn't
leave much room, assuming that memory on the PDP-11/20 ends at 100000.
