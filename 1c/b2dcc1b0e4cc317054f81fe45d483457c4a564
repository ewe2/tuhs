OK, I jiggled the memory board and the seqfault went away.  Which is weird
because I had all the boards out of this one, thoroughly vacuumed the
backplane and all boards and deoxidized the edge connectors before
reassembling.   So now the real box is behaving more like the simh and just
hanging, not panicing anymore.  How can I find this startup() you mention?
