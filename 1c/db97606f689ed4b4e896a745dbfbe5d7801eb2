I think it would be neat to leverage Apache's mod_autoindex HeaderName 
directive to include the text in the top header of the 
/Archive/Distributions/Research page.

I.e. copy the contents of the PDF into a text (or HTML) file and have it 
above the directory listing.

You can do similar with the ReadmeName for the footer below the 
directory listing.
