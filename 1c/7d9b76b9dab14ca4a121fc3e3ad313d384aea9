I'd been told a long time ago that  is stands for 'system' for people that need to administer the system, not necessarily super users.  The FreeBSD hier man page seems to bear this out:

     /sbin/     system programs and administration utilities fundamental to
                both single-user and multi-user environments

That's true, but /usr/dict was a bit of an odd-ball at the top /usr level.  /usr/share contained all the stuff from /etc and also other things that didn't seem to belong.  That's why it is documented as having the architecture independent files in it...
