If cc -I is there, it should be able to do the tailoring.

Also conditional compilation of non-declaration statements can
be replaced by regular if statements that typically can be
optimized away (though the old C compilers may not do so).


Incidentally, I would say that the use of conditional compilation
is evidence that the code is NOT truly universal, but has to be
specially adapted to various environments.
