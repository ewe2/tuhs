The Internet engineering community did quite a bit of work on resource
guarantees. (Google 'IntServ' and 'RSVP' - the latter is the control
protocol.)

Unfortunately, there was never much interest in it. People started doing
voice with just plain 'best effort' service, and I guess it worked 'well
enough' that nobody was interested in IntServ/RSVP.
