https://archive.org/details/ATTUNIXSystemVRelease4Version2
has source for several releases.

click "show all" on the right under "download options",
the file sysvr4.tar.bz2 has source for ksh88:

from cmd/ksh/sh/msg.c:
msg.c:    MSG e_version = "\n@(#)Version M-11/16/88d\0\n";

I think this was for x86 PCs.  I haven't tried to build it.
The date on the files is Jan 25 1993.
