Well, just promise to port Unix to it and it won't be off-topic.

Well, using a FPGA or microcontroller will reduce the chip count further.

You suggest that you won't use a 74LS181 because they are no longer made.
Whilst that's true, they are still readily available as NOS.  Overall, I
would suggest that using a 74LS181 (or 4) is a cleaner solution than
(ab)using a couple of EPROMs.  (The other option would be a PAL or GAL but
I suspect finding and programming them would be more difficult).
