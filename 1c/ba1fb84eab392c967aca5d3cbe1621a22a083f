B!  I would like to have a look at that - that, and NB.

Does anyone know if they're still extant, or their documentation at the very 
least?  (I've seen BCPL, and read some of its documentation, but it's still a 
hop-skip-and-a-jump away from C.  Some BCPL things do seem a little bit 
strange to a C user ... ;)
