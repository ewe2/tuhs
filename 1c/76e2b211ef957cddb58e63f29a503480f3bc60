Curling up in bed with e-ink based reader and pdf can be better than
curling up with 2kg-worth of hard book. I know, I do it.

As a huge fan of nonkindle reader, I have sdcard slot and do not have
to connect it at all. Batteries used to last at least a month. This
display type is really low power. I have recently bought a colored
e-ink reader, I charged it up about 35-45 days ago, read for at least
ten hours a week, and batt meter shows 40% (chances are, it is not
calibrated yet, I am still to discharge it to the end). As of colours,
this feels really like working prototype, they claim 4096 colors which
probably means 256 colors on "colored look-through display" times 16
shades of grey on classic e-ink display underneath. So, color is just
to spice it up a bit but not very useful at the moment... Albeit it
depends on content. Art photo no, sci articles maybe. They should come
to 65k one day, then I will be happier.
