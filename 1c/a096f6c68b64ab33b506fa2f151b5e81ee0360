I see two problems:
1. Bus transciever chips.
2. Software interface.

Most likely you want MSCP, but implementing a UDA50 clone is not quite
trivial. It is doable, but it would be quite some effort to write the
firmware for the controler processor. Maybe you can also implement other
emulations for RL02 or RK07 or ... That should be simpler then MSCP.
