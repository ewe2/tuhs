i would add the general atmosphere of the Unix room, especially the very =
heavy mobile hung from
the ceiling for a while (until someone noticed the cable supporting it =
was visibly stretching).

also the bowling alley (the corridor that rob, ken, denis, doug and my =
offices were on) =E2=80=94 the pins
were under the printer table at the end. i also recall the time the =
bowling ball got away from the
Unix room rolling down the main corridor towards a group of visitors led =
by peter weinberger.
luckily, dave presotto grabbed the ball before anyone got hurt (but it =
was close).

i would also mention labscam; its not often we see a prank involving rob =
pike, Penn and a Noble Prize winner.
