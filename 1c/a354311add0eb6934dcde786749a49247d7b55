All,

Yes, latest ts10 versions are at
ftp://ftp.firesword7.net/pub/ts10/develop.  11/780 emulation is not
finished yet because I am figuring out how some memory and unibus
configuration programming works.  I have working Massbus emulation for
11/780 emulation.

I don't know if it is any better since I haven't ever used it, but
supposedly ts10 can emulate a vax.
