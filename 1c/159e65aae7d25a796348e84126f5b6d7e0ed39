Subject: KDA50 woes
Message-ID: <9909020115.AA00610@meson.jpsystems.com>

Hi,

I wonder, does anyone here know anything about the KDA50? I've solved my RA72
problem (as it turns out, if there is no control panel connected, the drive
assumes normal operation, i.e., spin up, go on-line, enable port A, no write
protect, and the unit number between 0 and 7 is set by the switches on the
right side of the drive), but now I have a different problem: I can't get UNIX
(4.3BSD-Quasijarus of course) to recognize the KDA50, although it worked fine
on my Webster ESDI controller back in Ohio, and others have also reported
successfully booting it on different controllers. By inserting a few debugging
printouts in the uda driver, I have determined that it fails the udaprobe(). I
know very little about UDA50/KDA50 registers, so I may be wrong, but it looks
to me that the code is trying to do the following. It diddles the controller
registers to make it start the initialization. Then apparently it expects the
controller to interrupt and set some status bits in some register. However,
because of Q-bus's odd interrupt protocol and the need to determine the IPL of
the controller, the procedure is done non-trivially. First it does an spl6(),
disabling all interrupts except BR7 (which these controllers apparently don't
use). Then it does the register diddling and testing with these interrupts
disabled. It allows the CPU to field the interrupt only when the register bits
indicate that the operation has been performed and the interrupt has been
posted. Apparently the assumption is that the controller will post the
interrupt and then set the right bits in the right registers without waiting
for the CPU to field the interrupt. Also apparently the KDA50 is different and
doesn't set those bits until the interrupt is fielded, breaking this code.

So my questions to the folks are: First, is my understanding of the situation
correct? Second, what can be done about it? I guess as a temporary solution I
can remove this problematic IPL autodetection code and hard-code the IPL of my
KDA50, but what is it? Is the IPL set with switches on the KDA50 or how? And
what do the KDA50 switches do in the first place? Does anyone know? TIA.

My recollection is that V7M stood for V7-mini. It was a
striped down version of V7 that was designed to run on
the very low-end PDP-11's (like the 11/20).

	Hmmm, interesting.   My memories dredge up the 'M' as meaning
	"Modified".   Don't recall it ever being touted as 11/20 capable
	56kb, no MMU would be a wee bit too mini I'd think - was there ever
	a V7 that could run without an MMU?  If there was I've completely
	forgotten about it.

V7M was the DEC distribution of V7 (pre Ultrix days). Fred Canter did
most of the work, along with Jerry Brenner and Armando Stettner. It
supported non ID space machines, and some of the newer DEC hardware.
My manual lists it as working with :-

CPUS:-	11/23, 34, 44, 45/50/55, 60 and 70
Disks:-	RL02, RK06, RK07, RM02/3, RP04/5
Tapes:-	TU10, TE10, TU16, TE16, TS11

There was a strip down of V6 called Miniunix that would run on machines
without memory management, such at the 11/20, 05, 10 and 35/40 (without MMU
option). It required a full 56Kb machine, used the first 28Kb for the kernel
and swapped the last 28Kb for each process. Pipes worked by using a temporary
inode to store the data and swapping the processes. It was realllllllll slow.

The was also a similar version for 11/03's. I remember that there was an early
bug in that updates would always rewrite open inodes (last access time had
changed). You could physically wear out a floppy disk, since it was forever 
rewriting the sector with the inode for the console terminal.

Well, actually the M was for Modified.  Particularly modified to work
with some more DEC peripherals.

What ran on 11/20's was Mini-Unix, which was a stripped-down 6th
Edition.  By the way I'm not sure that the PUPS archive has a Mini-Unix
tape.  I have one, although it has not been read since the days when I
had an 11/20.

Yep, it's in Distributions/usdl/Mini-Unix. It's not in the research/
dir because it was not done in the labs, but elsewhere.

The IPL autodetect code has seemed to me as unneccessary. You know that
the KDA50 will always interrupt at spl5, so you can hard-code it in
the interrupt driver and nuke the autodetect code. The same with the 
other drivers that can be on Qbus:

	if (uh->uh_type == QBA)
		spl5();
