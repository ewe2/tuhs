Really? Those must be quite old as everything I've seen has both. But the
difference between kata and kana is much larger than upper and lower case.
It is rare to convert one to another as they are used to write different
things. Only to look things up in a dictionary would you convert, and then
you'd also be converting kanji to...

In Roman languages, very little is changed with all caps, though a few
things become ambiguous depending on the language...

In Japanese, it could turn some foreign loan word into a native word with a
totally different meaning...
