Subject: [TUHS] 4.4BSD and the MicroVax 3400
Message-ID: <200201242113.HAA25693@guardian-ext.bond.edu.au>

Anyone here know if 4.4BSD supports the MicroVax 3400 series of machines? One 
was given to me by my school (clearing out old equipment) and I would like to 
get some pure BSD goodness on it again. Also, anyone know if it's possible to 
make tapes under VMS?
Thanks in advance,
Rob Becker
