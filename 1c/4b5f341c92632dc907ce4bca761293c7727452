All,
	Welcome to 1999, I hope you all had a good Christmas and New Year.
I've just released a new version of my Apout PDP-11 simulator at

	ftp://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/pub/PDP-11/Sims/Apout/

The 6th/7th Edition stuff is untouched, but the emulator can now run
a significant number of binaries from 2.11BSD: /bin/sh, make, the C
compiler, most of /bin and /usr/bin. I've been able to rebuild both
ls and sh from the sources.

Although the emulated 2.11BSD environment isn't complete, its enough
to be nearly useful!

Cheers all,
	Warren
