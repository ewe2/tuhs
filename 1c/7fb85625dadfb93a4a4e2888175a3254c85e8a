	Results of Testing C Compilers

but not explained.

My favourite is

parentheses to kill the compiler
				Spurious diagnostic (10 parentheses)
				Compiler crash (100 parentheses)
				Server crash (10,000 parentheses)

explained on page 104:

=E2=80=A6 the server crash occurred when the tested compiler got a stack =
overflow on a heavily loaded machine with a very large memory. The =
operating system attempted to dump a gigabyte of compiler stack, which =
caused all the other active users to thrash, and many of them also =
dumped for lack of memory. The many disk drives on the server began a =

the operators to boot the server to recover. Excellent testing can make =
you unpopular with almost everyone.=20
