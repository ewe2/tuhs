Thank you, Clem.  I am working on getting the tools running in DOSBox,
which seemed most straightforward.

The Byte article (the scan of which I am very grateful for; not having to
go trawling through the stacks at the Oberlin College library is always a
plus) claims that the tools have been implemented on:

ACOS
Amdahl
Apollo
AN/UYK
Burroughs
CDC
Cray
Data General
DEC
FACOM
GEC
HP
HITAC
Honeywell
IBM
Intel
Interdata
Modcomp
Multics
NCR
Perkin-Elmer
Prime
Rolm
SEL
Tandem
Univac
Wang
Xerox
CP/M Machines
MS/DOS Machines
UNIX Machines

Which is quite the list; I've never even heard of a few of those!  Based on
the files in the UNIX Archive, am I to assume that most of those ports took
advantage of a native Pascal compiler?  That's how I'm planning to bring
the tools up on my local RT-11 machine.

-Henry
