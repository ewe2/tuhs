Emacs uses a thing called "unexec", or rather several things, one for each
OS, with varying complexity and fearsomeness.

The SunOS one was deleted in 2008:
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=2a5cb2584f9ca171ad4310a464d6236e5f005b0e

The Solaris one is the easiest, because dldump() is part of the OS:
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/src/unexsol.c?id=4daca38d5c673c5b6862e10cfade9559852cce12

Of course, the most popular systems (generic ELF, Windows, and Mac OS)
have the most complicated implementations of unexec.

Tony.
