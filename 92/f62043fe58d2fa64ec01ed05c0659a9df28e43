And also, check gives good results:

# check
RF:
 116 files
   6 large
   6 indirect
 249 used
 405 free
 336 missing

RK:	[ it dies here, as empty disk image ]

I think I know the problem why check was not working via Apout. Here's
a comment from the CHANGES file:

	2.3 Alpha2: to 10th Jan 2000
	----------------------------
	Added code to support 512-byte block seeks on /dev files for 1st Edition
	binaries. This was required to get tap(1) to work. This should really
	only force 512-byte seeks on specific /dev/files, not all of them.

So I suspect that check is doing something with seeks that I am not
dealing with correctly in Apout.

Cheers,
	Warren
