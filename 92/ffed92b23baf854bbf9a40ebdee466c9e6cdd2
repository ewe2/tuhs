As far as I know, LDAP is very much in use in the Linux world =E2=80=93 via=
 nslcd
or SSSD as clients; OpenLDAP (blech) or 389-ds as "build from scratch"
servers. There's also FreeIPA which tries to be an integrated solution.
(But even if you seek a pure Linux/Unix environment, I suspect AD is what
keeps LDAP from being replaced =E2=80=93 because as long as there are clien=
ts for
AD, there will be clients for pure LDAP as well.)

Kerberos exists too, but somewhat less common =E2=80=93 FreeIPA includes it=
 by
default, but many people just piggyback on LDAP bind as password-based
authentication and use SSH keys for passwordless (because apparently
protocols other than SSH and HTTPS don't exist anymore). The MIT Kerberos 5
suite is still actively maintained and receives new features, such as
S-PAKE), whereas Heimdal appears to be on life support.

(Speaking of zombies, Linux glibc still comes with Hesiod support built
in...)

Many people's idea of a central directory nowadays appears to be "deploy an
/etc/passwd via Salt or Ansible".
