My own recollection is that you got any combination of instruction and data space that was <64KB. This would also be subject to limits of pdp11 memory management unit.

You are conflating two things. :-)
A standard PDP-11 have 64Kb of virtual memory space. This can be divided 
any way you want between data and code.

Later model PDP-11 processors had a hardware feature called split I/D 
space. This meant that you could have one 64Kb virtual memory space for 
instructions, and one 64Kb virtual memory space for data.

(This also means that the text you quoted was incorrect, as it stated 
that you had 32Kb, which is incorrect. It was/is 32 Kword.)
