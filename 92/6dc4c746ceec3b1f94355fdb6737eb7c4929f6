Subject: [TUHS] networking on unix before uucp
Message-ID: <CADxT5N4L0YXSB0uqWeb6w87KJF+=0Mc7Nhb=Q_g+j8Q8-bQ7kg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I was wondering if Unix had any form of networking before uucp
appeared in Unix v7. It would be interesting to know if one could pass
a file from one Unix v5 machine to another without having to store it
on a magnetic tape.

There's some reference to a mysterious "Spider Interface" in the Unix
v5 manual. It seems to have something to do with DR-11B (which is a
general purpose direct memory access interface to the PDP-11 Unibus).

There's also reference to the "Spider line-printer" :)
