See the Google archive of comp.mail.maps where the UUCP map
(connection) pathalias data was regularly published for E-mail
routing purposes. People stopped making ASCII maps for the UUCP
network because it was too richly connected (too hard, too messy),
and because the sites included lat/long location data in their map
entries specifically for making geographic maps automatically.

I wrote the specification which included lat/long coordinates with
precisely that in mind, though it was some years before it happened.
