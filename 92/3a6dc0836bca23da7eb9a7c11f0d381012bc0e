My favorite use of the file system switch was the "face server"
(analogous to name server), documented in a paper by myself and Dave
Presotto at the Portland USENIX in 1985.
http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/face_the_nation/

We believe this was the first networked delivery of facial images to
indicate the sender of an arriving mail message. The associated vismon
program was also of interest in what it showed, and how small the code
was given the uniform system interface to resources.
