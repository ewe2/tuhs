As in a bootable 4.3BSD-Tahoe kit? As far as I know, no. The Unix Archive
has a broken copy in 4BSD/Distributions/4.3BSD-Tahoe, indicating that
both usr.tar and src.tar are broken.

It might/should be possible to merge files from the CRSG CD set from Kirk
to recreate these tar files.

Anybody out there have an unbroken Tahoe release?
