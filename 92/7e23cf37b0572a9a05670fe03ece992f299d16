Greg,
I've sent you a list of what I get.  I think, from the messages that I 
am getting the problem is in the various selections in the header file. 
I got it through by changing the definitions in the .c files.  The 
compiler doesn't seem to handle variations in the declarations very 
well.

All,
I have a different problem as well.  There is something broken in the 
configuration of this computer!!!!!  If I execute a shell file by going 
/bin/sh filename then it works ok but if I try running a shell script 
with #!/bin/sh in the first line I get a bad permission error.  This is 
preventing me from running make scripts and all sorts of things.  Any 
ideas?

Robin
