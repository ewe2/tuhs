The VAX 8800 was also the advent of the DEC BI bus attempt to lock third-party =
I/O devices out of the VAX market and prevent "unauthorized" competition with =
their own overpriced and underperforming I/O devices.

In late 1988 or early 1989 my group at Apple ordered a VAX-8810 to replace two =
11/780s on the promise from DEC that all our UniBus and MASSbus peripherals =
would still work ... which we knew (from others on the Internet who'd tried =
and reported their experiences) to be a lie.

After allowing DEC field circus to embarass themselves for a while trying to =
make it work, we cancelled our 8810 order and bought two 8650s instead (they =
cost half as much!), which we knew would run 4.3 BSD UNIX (unlike the 8800 =
series where we'd be stuck with Ultrix) and where all our old but still useful =
peripherals would still work. Surprise, DEC - your customers talk to each =
other and compare notes.

IIRC, as a consolation for DEC, we still bought a heavily discounted 6000 =
series BI machine with all new I/O to handle some other tasks that the 8650s =
weren't doing while also making clear to DEC that we understood the game they'd =
tried to play with us.

After that, Apple engineering concentrated on Sun & SGI gear, along with our =
Cray running UniCOS, but Apple IS&T (corporate IT) bought quite a bit of VAX =
gear to run VMS for certain applications they had to support.

Part of being in the Unix community was participating it as a community and =
sharing experiences like this for the benefit of all (and to keep hardware =
vendors honest) - the Unix-Wizards Internet mailing list, and comp.unix USENET =
newsgroup were invaluable in this regard.
