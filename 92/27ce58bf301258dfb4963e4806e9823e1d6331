As I recall, the Dataproducts band printers BP1000, BP2000 only had a
single hammer per column. But the band containing the full character set
moved so quickly into position for each column that the print speed was
incredible. We had both models at one point and the 2000 was an absolute
screamer.
Paper just flew over the paper guides to the collection basket in the rear.

It was impressive and incredible to watch in action.

The bands were easily replaceable via a release lever.  So you could change
fonts,  replace damaged bands, etc.
Sharp as heck as I recall on the edges.
You also had to make sure it lined up just right before engaging the
tension lever.

With cover down, they were remarkably quiet in comparison to other "high
speed" printers I had been around. Real good at multipart forms at making
clean clear impressions on the backmost layer.
