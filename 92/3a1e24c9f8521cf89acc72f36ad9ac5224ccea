Parent.  :-)

Something I learned today was (sed's author) McMahon's method of
arranging a tournament.

    ...was originally used as a club ranking system at the New York Go
    Club.  It was then adopted for Go tournaments in Britain, and has
    since become the most popular tournament system used in Go.
