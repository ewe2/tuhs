So while that is really neat, I personally think that's part of why Plan 9
didn't take off.  It's too clever, at least for me.  I know the rlogin
code pretty well and if you showed me that code and asked me what it was,
without the comments, I don't think I would have put it together.  On
the other hand, show me the C code and I'd be able to figure it out.

It's perhaps because I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, but I really
like how blindingly obvious a lot of the original Unix code was.  Not saying
it was all that way, but a ton of it was sort of what you would imagine it
to be before you saw it.  Which means I understood it and could bugfix it.
