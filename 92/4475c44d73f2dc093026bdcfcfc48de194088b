It turned out to be portable enough. And no worse than calloc dependencies
in the base X11 library (which assumes that the address used when the
integer 0 is assigned to a pointer has no bits set). The only other
assumption was that pointers and ints were passed the same way, and that
whatever NULL expanded to was at least as long as an int.

So, yes this wouldn't work on a system whose null-pointer representation
contained bits set, but that was already an assumption of X11...
