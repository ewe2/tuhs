Clem,

Thanks for your help. You=E2=80=99ve correctly interpreted my question.

Is the disk image independent from the disk hardware? I=E2=80=99d assume th=
at
different disks may have different block sizes etc, so the disk type may be
important.

The target system is LSX, a cut-down version of V6 designed to run on the
LSI-11. There are very few system utilities in the standard build (no mount
for example). The second floppy is permanently mounted at boot time. I=E2=
=80=99m
interested in making source file floppies on my modern system to use on the
LSX, so I want to be able to create an image file from a source folder tree=
.

Paul
