Thanks!  This will be very helpful.  I found two portability problems:
"install" on modern systems is not in /usr/ucb (in fact, there is no
/usr/ucb), and the definition of nodenamelength in mpwlib/lockit.c uses
the non-portable constant SYS_NMLN.  I changed this to the constant 257,
which appears to be the usual default value.

No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the
continent, a part of the main.  If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a
manor of thy friends or of thine own were: any man's death diminishes me,
because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for
whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.  --John Donne
