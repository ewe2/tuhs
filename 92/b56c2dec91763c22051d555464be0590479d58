the pierce loop had its own protocol  on its own wire.
that meant it could only be local-area. the PL was
in operation on a packard-bell 516 when i arrived
at the labs in june '66. carl christensen was the
software person for both the loop and the 516.
i assume that pierce and condon were the hw
guys, but that was before my time.

spider was similar, but was designed to run on
the standard telephone T1 lines. thus, the whole
idea was more wide-area. the major draw back
of spider, and probably the reason it was never
really used, was that it couldnt make a connection.
all connections were pre-created at boot time.
a lesser reason was that the controller was a
tempo computer that no one loved. the system
software sucked. quickly it became unmaintained.
i think tempo went out of business. anyway, the
spider controller was the first and only tempo
computer that i saw or even heard of.
