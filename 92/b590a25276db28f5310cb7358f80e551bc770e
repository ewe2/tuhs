Speaking of DEMOS, I was browsing through that a while back (when it was 
first posted here; I forgot to post about it at the time) and saw a 
feature that doesn't seem to have existed anywhere else that I could 
find - placing interpreter arguments after the command line arguments of 
a script.

I.e. something like "#!/bin/foo bar $* baz". Has any American unix had 
this? Some these days won't even allow multiple arguments at all.

I don't know Russian - it'd be interesting to see what else was 
unique/new in DEMOS.
