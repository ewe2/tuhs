In V6 (and probably before that, too), it was numbers:

  http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V6/usr/man/man4/rp.4

So on my machine which had 2 x 50MB CalChomps, with a Diva controller, which
we had to split up into two partition each (below), they were dv00, dv01, dv10
and dv11. Letters for the partitions made it easier...

No, in V6 filesystems, block numbers (in inodes, etc - also the file system
size in the superblock) were only 16 bits, so a 50MB disk (100K blocks) had to
be split up into partitions to use it all. True of the RP03/04 in V6 too (see
the man page above).
