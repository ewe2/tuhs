Yeah, it was the C.mmp I was thinking of when I said that CMU obviously 
had to have been playing at this.

As someone else mentioned, the 11/780 had a separate product for user 
written microcode. I think it actually also included a different board 
for the CPU, with more memory for the microcode. So it must have been 
documented externally somehow, somewhere.

The 11/750 was not documented for external use, I think. However, I have 
some vague memory of seeing something about user written microcode for 
it as well.
And of course, Ultrix had a microcode patch for the 11/750, which fixed 
some bugs in a couple of instructions. This microcode patch is still 
included in the NetBSD/vax distribution. :-)

The 86x0 machines always loaded microcode from the FE RL02, and there is 
documentation on that microcode available today, although it was DEC 
internal at the time. And I still happen to have access to an 8650. But 
no time to actually try and play with the microcode. And that machine is 
rather complex as well. That's when things started to get pipelined and 
other stuff that makes things much more difficult to fool around with.
