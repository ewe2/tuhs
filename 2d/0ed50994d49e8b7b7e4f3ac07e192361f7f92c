packet switching won over Virtual Circuits in the now distant past
but in small, local and un-congested networks without reliability =
constraints,
any solution can look good. If =E2=80=9CPerformance is Hard=E2=80=9D, so =
are Manageability & Reliability.

Packet switching hasn=E2=80=99t scaled well to Global size, at least =
IMHO.

Ethernet only became a viable LAN technology with advent of Twisted =
pair: point to point + Switches.
The One Big Idea for common channels, collision detection/avoidance,=20
	became moot, even irrelevant with switch buffering & =
collision-less connectivity.

Watching networking types deal with ethernet multi-path routing & link =
failover - quite problematic for 802.1 layer-2 nets,
I can=E2=80=99t but think =E2=80=9CIf you don=E2=80=99t design a feature =
in, why expect it to show up?=E2=80=9D.

All those voluminous CCITT / ITU-T standards were solving the problem =
=E2=80=9Ckeep the network up & working=E2=80=9D,
they knew it wasn=E2=80=99t easy =E2=80=98at scale=E2=80=99. Harder if =
you have to billing :)

Something I=E2=80=99ve never understood is how to design large-scale VM =
farms ,
where DB=E2=80=99s, Filestores & =E2=80=99services=E2=80=99 (eg Web) =
have to be migrated between physical hosts,
made more difficult when services have to be split out of existing =
instances: who gets to keep the MAC & IP address?

I can=E2=80=99t see either a layer-2 or IP addressing scheme that=E2=80=99=
s simple and works well / reliably for large VM fleets.
Whereas, =E2=80=98well known=E2=80=99 Virtual Circuit endpoints can be =
permanently allocated & tied to an instance/service.

Packet encapsulation & separation techniques, like MPLS, VPN=E2=80=99s =
and VLAN=E2=80=99s, are now commonplace in IP networks.
Even the ubiquitous (multi-level) use of NAT for traffic isolation & =
preventing unwanted ingress shows, IMO, a design failure.

Why would I advertise my internal network with IPv6 and allow every bad =
actor to probe my entire network? Hellish security admin for little =
benefit.
I=E2=80=99ve never understood this reasoning.

It seems to me, IP networks are trying to provide the functionality of =
Virtual Circuits - dedicated paths, transparent failover & even =
committed data rates.

There are two very valuable functions that =E2=80=98dedicated paths=E2=80=99=
, implying topology-aware switches, can do that packet-switch can=E2=80=99=
t:

	- Network-based =E2=80=9CCall Transfer=E2=80=9D
		There=E2=80=99s no packet-switch mechanism I know,
		that allows a connection to an advertised =E2=80=98gateway=
=E2=80=99 or authenticator,
		that then allows invisible network rerouting of the =
connection to a =E2=80=99service provider=E2=80=99 or host,
		without giving away information to the caller.

		This would be really handy for =E2=80=9Cfollow me=E2=80=9D=
 connections, moving between user devices, even different access =
networks.
		Apple have just announced something like this - moving =
running sessions between Mac, iPad, iPhone as needed.

		The inverse, =E2=80=9Cblocked caller id=E2=80=9D, =
can=E2=80=99t be done in IP without a repeating host, ence VPN=E2=80=99s.
		[ In telephony, all A & B parties are identified for =
billing & forensics / interception. Addrs only hidden from other users. =
]


	- =E2=80=9CMulticast=E2=80=9D / Conference calls
		Packet switched =E2=80=98conferencing=E2=80=99 is rarely =
done by the Network, despite multicast IP standards 25yrs of more old, =
they are rarely used.
		If major router vendors had good solutions, they=E2=80=99d=
 be pushing them.
		The Pandemic brought forward the need for video calling =
everywhere, created a market for =E2=80=9CConferencing=E2=80=9D products =
& =E2=80=9CStreaming=E2=80=9D.

		Isn=E2=80=99t Multicast of Free To Air TV & radio over =
Internet both obvious & desirable?

		It should be the modern equivalent of & replacement for =
=E2=80=98wireless=E2=80=99 broadcasting.
		Should be trivial if everyone has one or more mobile =
devices and a home Internet connection.
		The current Point-Point transmission model of Streaming =
Services - no scheduled broadcasts, On-demand only -
			seems to be the most resource intensive, hence =
costly, solution possible.

		Flash storage is under $0.20/GB, a small PVR with 1TB of =
=E2=80=9Ccircular buffer=E2=80=9D could cheaply convert =E2=80=9CScheduled=
=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9COn Demand=E2=80=9D at the customer premises.

at surveillance recording. Purportedly, =E2=80=9C100 days of video=E2=80=9D=

One of the modern challenges for Enterprise Customers is =E2=80=9Cchange =
network provider=E2=80=9D.
One major Aussie firm just took two years to move Service Provider and =
it was =E2=80=99news=E2=80=99.

25yrs ago, and probably now as well, interconnecting / splitting =
corporate networks following merges / de-merges was a huge task.
IP networks require re-numbering and basic IP services, like DNS, email, =
web, need re-provisioning / re-platforming.

The Worst Case error - happens too often - is Network Admins cutting =
themselves off from the Remote Admin Network.
=E2=80=98Recovery=E2=80=99 is slow & painful - all sites / all devices =
may have to be visited, even if you have a backup network link.
Did Microsoft have a fault like this in the last 12 mths after it =
acquired a vendor? There was a big outage.

Post merger, Enterprise phone switch & voice network are relatively =
simple & fast to change and rarely result in Admins losing Remote Admin =
access.

It=E2=80=99s not that I don=E2=80=99t like cheap, easy Ethernet devices =
that mostly Just Work and at small scale are simple to setup and easy to =
manage.
30 years of hardware development has been a boon to us all, in almost =
all ways.

Rob Pike wrote a great piece (in the 1980=E2=80=99s) about cheap =
hardware forcing systems software to take up the slack, an example I =
thought of Ashby=E2=80=99s Law of Requite Variety.

Have we arrived in this Packet Switch nightmare because of "Microsoft is =
Best=E2=80=9D thinking?

I don=E2=80=99t have a proper name for this blinkered view of the world, =
backed by arrogance & the assumption =E2=80=9CWhat I don=E2=80=99t know =
can=E2=80=99t matter=E2=80=9D.
