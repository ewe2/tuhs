Greetings

I wonder if anyone on this list has any idea where I can find some information 
regarding the AT+T PC7300? I have one, but it seems that the power supply has 
problems. In any case, it is designed for a lower voltage than what we have 
here, namely 220V 50Hz. 

I should like to know if it is possible to get schematic diagrams for the 
power supply so that I can get an electronics engineer friend to have a go at 
redesigning it.

Am I barking up the wrong tree?

regards
Duncan
