You can indulge in 18-bit nostalgia courtesy of Bob Supnik.  His Computer
History Simulation Project includes simulators for the DEC 18-bit computer
line.  Check out http://simh.trailing-edge.com/ if you are interested.

Unfortunately,  there isn't much surviving software for these machines.  The
site does include a PDP-7 based simulator of the PDP-8(!),  and the
"Advanced Software System" OS for the PDP-15 (which I believe will also run
on the PDP-9).

Bob's wish list includes a plea for DECsys and the First through Fourth
Editions of Unix,  but unless someone unearths a cache somewhere,  these may
be lost to history.  Too bad. :-(
