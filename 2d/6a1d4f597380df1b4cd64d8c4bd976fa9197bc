Well, for a start, I've got most of the src/libc/gen ported - but I'll need to 
work on some of the files.  I've been saving the command-line to a file so I 
can see just what and where I'm finding problems.

src/libc/sys is *.s files, and I've got no background in VAX assembler or gas, 
so I'd rather someone who's experienced takes that on.

Thanks

Wesley Parish
