I could drop names, but at some point the labels became quite uniform.
To illustrate that, look at the labels in an old top1000 of USENET 
sites.

They bore quickly.

The largest secondary tld nameserver ever was simply called ns 
(ns.EU.net),
I don't recall the internal hostname, but it was probably some norse
god like balder or buri.

Some stuff that randomply pops up in my mind:

- anon and penet
Reference to anon.penet.fi, early to mid '90s, a generic 386/486 box at 
Julfs house and at undisclosed locations later on.
Suitable for naming mail relays, outgoing mail servers and anonymity 
realetd services.

- kremvax
Fictional machine. Suitable for jokes, routers related to anything in 
the east.

- mcvax, mcsun
Suitable for anything related to europe.

- sunsite
A 90s thing. Suitable for sharing software, and, as a pun on Sun, java 
related stuff maybe.

- gatekeeper
Again, labels became boring, ftp.uu.net was famous as ftp site, but 
gatekeeper.dec.com had
a cool hostname.

- chronos
chronos.eu.net was a go to time server in europe, replaced by 
rolex.ripe.net.

- agate
After agate.berkeley.edu, where BSD escaped the university until the 
lawyers stepped in.
