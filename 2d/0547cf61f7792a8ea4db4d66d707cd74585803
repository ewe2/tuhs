Ah, OK.

Well, V7 came out in January, 1979, and NCP wasn't turned off until January,
1983, so people had a lot of time to get it running under V7.

I'm not sure what it was usually called; we didn't have much contact with it
at MIT (although I had the source; I'm the one that provided it to TUHS).

The problem was that although MIT had two IMPs, all the ports on them were
spoken for, for big time-sharing mainframes (4 PDP-10's running ITS; 1
running TWENEX; a Multics), so there were no ports available to plug in a
lowly PDP-11. (We were unable to get an IP gateway (router) onto the ARPANET
until MIT got some of the first C/30 IMPs.) So we had no use for the NCP Unix
(which I vaguely recall was described as 'the ARPANET Unix from UIll').
