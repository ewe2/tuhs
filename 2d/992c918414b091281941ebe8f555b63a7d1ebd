fyi warner,

	in your talk, you referred to Alex Fraser at bell labs.
he was my first director, and always went by =E2=80=9Csandy=E2=80=9D.
i asked my wife (who was a secretary at the time) and she
said he was occasionally referred to as Alex. certainly, every
time i saw anything written by him or references to a talk by him
always used =E2=80=9Csandy=E2=80=9D.

	andrew
