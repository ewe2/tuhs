> At around that point in time (I don't have the very _earliest_ code, =
to get an exact date, but the oldest traces I see [in mapalloc(), below] =
are from September '78), the CSR group at MIT-LCS (which were the people =
in LCS doing networking) was doing a lot with asynchronous I/O (when =
you're working below the reliable stream level, you can't just do a =
blocking 'read' for a packet; it pretty much has to be asynchronous). I =
was working in Unix V6 - we were building an experimental 1Mbit/second =
ring - and there was work in Multics as well.

> I don't think the wider Unix community heard about the Unix work, but =
our group regularly filed updates on our work for the 'Internet Monthly =
Reports', which was distributed to the whole TCP/IP experimental =
community. If you can find an archive of early issues (I'm too lazy to =
go look for one), we should be in there (although our report will =
alsocover the Multics TCP/IP work, and maybe some other stuff too).

Sounds very interesting!

Looked around a bit, but I did not find a source for the =E2=80=9CInternet=
 Monthly Reports=E2=80=9D for the late 70=E2=80=99s =
(rfc-editor.org/museum/ has them for the 1990=E2=80=99s).

In the 1970=E2=80=99s era, it seems that NCP Unix went in another =
direction, using newly built message and event facilities to prevent =
blocking. This is described in "CAC Technical Memorandum No. 84, =
Illinois Inter-Process Communication Facility for Unix.=E2=80=9D - but =
that document appears lost as well.

Ah, well, topics for another day.=
