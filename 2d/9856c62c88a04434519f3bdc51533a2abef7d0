Subject: [TUHS] Legal ramifications putting certain things on my web site?
Message-ID: <9829AFEA-2430-11D6-A883-003065C1AC88@apk.net>

I've started porting some of the old UNIX programs to Mac OS X.  I've 
got about 1/2 the games, that should be ok, but I also have other things 
like crypt and makekey.  I'd like to make these available in binary 
form, but I don't want the men in black knocking  at my door either...

Any thoughts?

On a side note, I simply can not believe how easy it is to compile this 
old code under Mac OS X.  for some of it, it's proving easier than 
porting Linux code ( if you've only known how long I worked on linux's 
fortune, and the old one just compiled no fuss, no problems ).

Also, if your wandering why ... that's easy, because I can.

Thanks.
