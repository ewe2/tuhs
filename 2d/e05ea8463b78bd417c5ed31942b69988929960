Subject: [TUHS] Oldish UnixWare 2.x boxed copy - useful to TUHS or someone?
Message-ID: <4.3.2.7.2.20040222102606.00b70e90@postal.farfalle.com>

Subject says it. I've got an old (well, 10+ years old) copy of Unixware 
(pre-old-SCO; I think it's release 2.01 or 2.03) in a boxed set with 
manuals, CDROMs, patch diskettes, etc. Is this of any use to TUHS or 
someone else as a donation or is it "too recent"?

cheers, /David/
