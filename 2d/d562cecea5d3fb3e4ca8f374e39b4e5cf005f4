Yes: 
cn      1 176540 344    5       cnrint  cnxint

# NKL includes both KL11's and DL11's.
NKL             4               # KL11, DL11
The card has four ports, one of them is the console. (The M8192 CPU card
has no SLU / ROM / ...) 

But I would prefere to get the DHV11 working. It seams that this device
is more suitable for multi user operation. 

BTW: Never play with the SMD cables when the machine is running. Now I
get: 
# fsck
** /dev/ra0a
File System: /

** Last Mounted on /
** Root file system
** Phase 1 - Check Blocks and Sizes
** Phase 2 - Check Pathnames
** Phase 3 - Check Connectivity
** Phase 4 - Check Reference Counts
** Phase 5 - Check Free List
BLK(S) MISSING
SALVAGE? y

** Phase 6 - Salvage Free List
1364 files, 11625 used, 2430 free

***** FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED *****

But on the next reboot I get the same when running fsck. Any hints?
