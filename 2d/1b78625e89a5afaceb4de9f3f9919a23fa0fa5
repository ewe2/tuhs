I would guess that was one strong reason.  Snyder was at Bell Labs
during the very time B transformed into C, and brought that version back
to MIT.  If you think K&R C looks outdated and crufty, you may balk at
this "primeval C".  (I find it quite charming myself.)

The compiler is also quite slow and the emitted code is not very good.

I think the Snyder compiler wouldn't be the best for moving code around
these computers.  I can see pcc would be a much better choice.
