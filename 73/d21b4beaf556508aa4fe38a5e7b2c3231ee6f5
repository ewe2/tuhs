Hello again from Gregg C Levine
Okay, that covers my questions for your department. Thank you, David.
 No networking? Why not? Can that be added? And how did you add the
source code disks?

And as for the comment, David, I just remember them, and write them
down. He did say those, and probably has them filed the way I
suggested. Mine second, your selection first, and third.
