Subject: [TUHS] Move completed: slowly bringing stuff back up
Message-ID: <1505094524.4130645.1101599000.45DB692A@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Evening,

Okay - now that I've completed moving and settling in, I am slowly
bringing some stuff back up.  UCBVAX should come back in the next few
weeks (now much closer to Berkeley...).

One advantage of the new location: cheaper power so my PBX runs all the
time now. ;)

Once I acquire a second modem I will accept UUCP at 115200 and 2400 baud
via telephone :)
