Subject: Mangled and non-mangled TUHS mail lists
Message-ID: <20171001032536.GB31930@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, there are now two variants of the TUHS mailing list. E-mail sent
to tuhs at tuhs.org will propagate to both of them.

The main TUHS list now:
  - doesn't strip incoming DKIM headers
  - doesn't alter the From: line
  - doesn't alter the Subject: line
and hopefully will keep most mail systems happy.

The alternative, "mangled", TUHS list:
  - strips incoming DKIM headers
  - alters the From: line
  - alters the Subject: line to say [TUHS]
  - puts in DKIM headers once this is done
and hopefully will keep most mail systems happy but in a different way.

You can choose to belong to either list, just send me an e-mail if
you want to be switched to the other one. But be patient to start with
as there will probably be quite a few wanting to change.

Cheers, Warren
