Subject: [TUHS] V10 spell vs. spell.old?
Message-ID: <201712061423.vB6ENOZZ011903@skeeve.com>

Hi.

What's the difference between spell.old and spell in the V10 sources?
I'm guessing spell.old is the original version for the small-address-space
PDP-11 and that plain spell takes better advantage of the roomier vax...

Thanks,

Arnold
