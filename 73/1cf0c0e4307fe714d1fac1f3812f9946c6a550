Can anyone point me to instructions on getting the tape in: Ken_Wellsch_v6
up and running on Supnik's Simulator? I have been trying some things, and
when it gives me the '=' prompt, anything i type makes the program freeze.

Any help would be appreciated.

Have a look at the 6th Edition installation instructions at:

All,
	After some reading though papers and books, I've come up with the
following brief timeline of very early UNIX development. I just thought
some of you might find it interesting.

	Warren


		   Early dates of UNIX Development

As accurately as we can tell, anyway! References given where possible.

1969
	Unknown: Ken creates `Space Travel'. It was first written on Multics,
		then transliterated into Fortran for GECOS, then Ken and
		Dennis rewrote Space Travel to run on the PDP-7

The original .jpeg could do with re-saving; with xv you can get it
down to 10% of the original volume.

I have been following these instructions, the problem comes up when I
get the '=' prompt. I type: "tmrk", it just freezes.


Thanks for the help,

The 6th Ed installation instructions say: The tape contains 12100 512-byte
records followed by a single file mark. Have you made the tape image for
Bob Supnik's emulator to match this, and what configuration file are you
giving to the emulator?

Thanks,
	Warren

P.S You can use the RK05 disk image in
Distributions/research/Dennis_v6/v6root.gz, or the RL02 image in
Bootable_Images/v6_rl02_unknown.gz,
unless you really do want to install V6 from tape.

You're following the wrong instructions.  :-)  Or, at least, you're
taking them too literally.  You're trying to use the tape the way it
would be done on a real machine, but it's much easier to just split it
into disk images under the host UNIX.  Looking in my V6 directory,
I've got a text file containing something that I believe Warren wrote,
in a text file accompanying the tape image:

"This is a copy of the Sixth Edition distribution tape which was sent
to me by Ken Wellsch. The file v6.tape.gz is the tape image, with the
first 100 512-byte tape blocks containing tape bootstrap stuff. Blocks
100 - 4099 are the RK05 root image, blocks 4100 - 8099 are the /usr
RK05 image, and the blocks 8100 - 12099 are the /doc RK05 image."

So what I did with that tape, for Bob Supnik's PDP-11 simulator, was
to run these commands under the host UNIX:

	% gunzip v6.tape.gz
	% dd if=v6.tape of=v6.root.rk05 count=4000 skip=100
	% dd if=v6.tape of=v6.usr.rk05 count=4000 skip=4100
	% dd if=v6.tape of=v6.doc.rk05 count=4000 skip=8100

Then, I made a script file for the simulator:

	% cat > v6.script
	attach rk0 V6.root.rk05
	attach rk1 V6.usr.rk05
	attach rk2 V6.doc.rk05
	boot rk0
	^d
	%

...and finally, I run the resulting system, thus:

	% pdp11 v6.script
	PDP-11 simulator V2.3
	@unix
	login:

I may have had to modify something in the actual UNIX V6 system to
mount rk1 and rk2 properly -- I don't recall.  You'll figure it out.

Anyway, the system runs like a charm, and I've successfully rebuilt
the kernel from sources on it.  Fun!

Good luck!

That's neat!  I've got a very good print of it here (that huge Epson
color inkjet printer we bought at work really does a good job with the
expensive "photo quality" paper in it), and will frame it and hang it
on the wall of my basement machine room in my home.  However (and my
ignorance is showing now, I know) who is whom in the picture?

Thanks a lot. It works now.

OK, so I was at my ISP the other day and after a talk with the owner I
walked home with a bunch of pieces from a microvax II, which I used to
completely pimp out my PDP-11/73...  One of the new pieces is a hard
drive, which allows me to write assembly code with the RSTS/E Macro
Assembler, write them to the hard drive, and boot the system up in
non-RSTSish ways...

I'm new to PDP-11 assembly language, however, and I don't have a really
complete manual...  The general purpose registers are all 16 bits.
Addresses stored in these registers can only point to the first 32K words
of memory.  My PDP has a 512K words of memory.  The only reference I've
seen to this problem was one sentence in one of my manuals that says the
rest of the memory can be addressed through "memory management".  When it
says this, does it mean that there is a separate memory management unit
that I have to control to flip between pages or banks of memory, or are
there extended registers in the CPU itself that allow me to do this?  I
crashed the machine the other day and I noticed that the monitor listed
some registers that started with M...  Could that be what these are for?
(The computer claims to have 22-bit addressing, BTW.)
