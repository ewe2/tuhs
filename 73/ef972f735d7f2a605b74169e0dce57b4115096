Nice find. What does the label on the big hard drive read? I have found a
similar drive with a worn label and i am trying to see if i can find a
system to connect it to.

If you want multiple users on an -11/03, Mini-Unix would be an option; it<b=

If Mini-Unix supports multiple users, it ought to be possible to do the sam=
