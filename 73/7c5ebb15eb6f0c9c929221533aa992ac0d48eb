On the flip side, it certainly does beat `char* x, y, z[100];` or
`FILE* fpsrc, fpdst;`. I wonder how many aspiring C programmers have
been tripped up by constructs like those? It's perfectly reasonable
_once you know about it_, but if you don't, then, well...

It's even more fun if your system doesn't have memory protection. No,
I'm not speaking from experience; what made you think that I did? ;-)
