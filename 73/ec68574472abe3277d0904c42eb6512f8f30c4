Warren,

The hardest part was patching and compiling simh under Linux. I have 
edited the various files by hand and have attached a new KE.diff.

Also, the build failed at tools/assemv2. I had to supply the files names 
by hand:

root at linux:/var/files/unix72# tools/assemv2
rebuilding...
patching...
vec0407
initorig
v2_as
missing header for unified diff at line 3 of patch
The text leading up to this was:
--------------------------
|--- u0.s Wed May 7 01:20:13 2008
|+++ ../a/u0.s Wed May 7 01:19:38 2008
--------------------------
File to patch:

When I supplied the file names, u0.s, u1.s, u5.s, and ux.s, it patched 
them just fine and I was able to finish the process without a hitch.

Very cool!

Jim
