Peter Adams, who photographed many Unix folks for his
"Faces of open source" series (http://facesofopensource.com/),
found trinkets from the Unix lab in the Bell Labs archives:
http://www.peteradamsphoto.com/unix-folklore/.

One item is more than a trinket. Belle, built by
Ken Thompson and Joe Condon, won the world computer
chess championship in 1980 and became the first
machine to gain a chess master rating. Physically,
it's about a two-foot cube.
