Reminds me of a comment a seasoned co-worker came out with when
looking over a new employee's program, filled with
variableNamesThatRanOnAndOnForHalfALineOrMaybeLonger.  "I used to
write boot loaders that were shorter than your variable names!"

 Speaking of which, am I the only one annoyed by Penguin/OS' silly

 Thanks, all; I'll just knock up a simple script that blows away the
entire environment and unaliases everything in sight.  I'll probably
call it "orca" because I have a warped sense of humour...

 Unix taught me to be minimalist; you had to be when writing a
bootstrap to fit into 512 bytes...

If you happen to be on Red Hat derived Linux, the easiest way to turn
off all this crap is to rename /etc/profile to something like
/etc/profile.dist and then populate your own startup scripts.

For a minimalist prompt I just use:

  export PS1='h $ '
