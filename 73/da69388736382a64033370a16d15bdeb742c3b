Probably not. Repeated "dd"s will not produce the same result. This is the
typical error when not understanding that tapes actually are not a stream
of characters. (And also a good example when the Unix paradigm fails 
pretty bad).
Each write to the tape device will create a block. You cannot do two
writes after each other to extend the block. You will instead get two
different blocks.

Boot tapes for VAXen (and PDP-11s) are expected to have 512 byte
blocks. Actually, the first block should be repeated twice, and this is
the primary boot block. After that you can put whatever you want. Most
primary boot blocks however also expects to read 512 byte blocks, which
means that the next file (secondary booter or the system itself) also most
often is written with 512 byte blocks.

Don't. The moment you copy a tape file to disk, you will loose meta
information unless you use a program specifically designed to preserve
that information.
