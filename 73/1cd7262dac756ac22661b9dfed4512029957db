It's amazing how long stuff lives, very cool.  Just like the runoff
thread, stuff goes back to Multics and even earlier.  Good ideas die
hard.

I also think that any idea of Facebook group for old Unix people is dead
in the water.  I can only speak for myself but hell will freeze over
before I have a Facebook account, they have engineers that target kids,
they have to pay more because people are ashamed to work there.  It
just makes me sad to think that technology is being used like Facebook
does.  It's just my opinion, but the world would be a better place if
Facebook ceased to exist.

If we need another place for old farts to hang out, there are many.
I like groups.io, it's free for most stuff, it's super easy to be
a moderator, I moderate 12 groups there and am a member of a bunch
more.  What they call groups, we would call an email list with a
bunch of knobs that help keep things sane.
