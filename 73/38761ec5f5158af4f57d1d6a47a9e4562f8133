ITS, yes.  But the debugger was not just a debugger, it was also a general
command-line interpreter, a shell in modern terms.  So while it is possible
to debug an empty memory into doing whatever you want, it is also possible
to run "advent", aka Colossal Cave Adventure.

I switched from Teco to ex at some point, and never went either forward or
back.  (Occasionally I drop into vi mode for things like parenthesis
checking.)

By the way, did anyone else start out on Unix-alikes before using actual
Unix?  I read the BSTJ issue and became an instant convert, but only when
$EMPLOYER got a MicroVAX was I able to work like that.  Next came the MKS
Toolkit on DOS, and then Cygwin for many years.  I suppose it's only my
last two $EMPLOYERs standardizing on the Mac that has left me running,
like, actual Unix.

True.  But then, many of us geeks make our choices not on technical
criteria but on tribal loyalty.  Which is *technically* superior, vi or
emacs?  (Please don't answer that.)

Note that Emacs is probably the oldest import into the Unix ecosystem from
outside, and it bears the marks of its origin: monolithic (but
programmable), one tool does it all.

Without doubt.  I am not loyal to a kernel or a set of utilities, I simply
follow the Way of Unix: <http://vrici.lojban.org/~cowan/upc/> (sadly
