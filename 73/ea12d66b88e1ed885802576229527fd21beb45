I think it might have been in the original COFF which came from those days, but its possible its from one of the many bastardization of COFF that occurred after its birth.    I don't remember it being in any of the a.out flavors and I don't think macho has it.

My recollection is that this was driven by (late) Larry Loucks, with assistance from Jack O???Quin and several of the ISC folks.

I didn’t pay much attention to this at the time, and don’t remember specifics. 

Given the change in focus from RT to RS/6000 in the transition from AIX 2 to AIX 3, and all of the other changes that occurred in AIX 3, I assume we started with something very primitive in AIX 1 and re-implemented for AIX 3. 

I’ve sent Jack a note about this discussion. Unless he or ISC folks chime in, or I find someone else to comment or provide documentation, I probably can’t add more. Rick Simpson wrote an article for Byte that might have something about this. He probably contributed to the initial design and (presumed) re-design.
