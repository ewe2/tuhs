Hello again from Gregg C Levine
Yes, Ian. That's exactly what I mean. Of course I was thinking of RL02
images, rather then a RK05 image. Which one did you choose? And can

And your response was the simpler form, which is what I wanted.
David's comment was a bit obtuse, but I got it. By the way? Are you a
WB fan? As in Warner Bros. Animation. I'm partial to the wisdom of B.
Bunny.
