Introducing the UNIX System, (c) 1983, ISBN 0-07-045001-3 
by Henry McGilton and Rachel Morgan

The book covers V7 and is a general intro to UNIX.
It has one chapter on administration near the end 
of the book.  It covers very basic stuff:

* setting the date
* startup/shutdown
* users and groups, su command
* file systems (mkfs, mount, umount, fsck, icheck, ncheck)
* adding devices (mknod)
* dump, restor, tar

Overall though this is still a great book on UNIX in general,
even today.  Great tutorials on ed, sed, ex, vi, nroff/troff,
and ms macros make it worthwhile to own.
