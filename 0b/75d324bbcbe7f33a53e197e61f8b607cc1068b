Right - certainly my behavior and what I preached at the time.  But it was
also true for >>some<< sites inside the labs - frankly many from the ones I
knew (Mary Ann what did run in Columbus).   There were definitely copies of
BSD in IH, as I know sent some of the stuff from my own work there. I never
really understood who 'had' to run 32/V or (PWB 3.0 and PWB 4.0) and like
Redman and the Marx machines were 'allowed' to be BSD.

What I came to realize is that if a site ran VMS inside the labs, it was
because they either had a commercial app that required it, or a had some
really important FORTRAN code that needed the DEC tools.    In the case of
the later, since the stuff I worked on had a commercial Fortran compiler
associated (great-great-grandfather to PGI compilers), those sites could
use BSD so they could get the distribution (I must have written about 25-30
tapes before I left).  But my stuff only ran on BSD 4.1/4.1a/4.1b/4.1c   -
I think Rick Spieklemeyers updated it when 4.2 and 4.3 finally finished but
I had left UCB by then.
