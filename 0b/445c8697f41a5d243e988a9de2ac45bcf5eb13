How about:
(
  dd if=mtboot conv=sync bs=512
  dd if=mtboot conv=sync bs=512
  dd if=boot conv=sync bs=512
) |dd of=/dev/whatever bs=512

Quote Of The Moment:
  It has been said very justly that every virtue is, as it were, a
  middle course between two opposite vices. Thus, courage is midway
  between cowardice and rashness; thrift is midway between
  acquisitiveness and improvidence; morality is midway between prudery
  and licentiousness; and so forth. In like manner, justification stands
  half-way between the faults of pedantry, on the one hand, and the
  failures of ignorance, on the other.
