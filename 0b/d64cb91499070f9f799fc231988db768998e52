Not sure; I'm positive that there were two drivers: the one above, and,
aha!  One called dz.c-elec, which was the one that I meant.

Ah yes:

/*

Note this bit:

     #define	NDZ		 7		/* no. of dz-11s */

As I said, it went like a bat out of hell :-)  You'd be nuts to use
the interrupt per xmit char...
