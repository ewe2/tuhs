It does seem counter-intuitive that email addresses go right-to-left 
like postal addresses rather than left-to-right like phone numbers. But 
these days with auto-complete, I can type the first couple of characters 
of an email address and the correct one pops up.  That would never work 
with com.whatever

When they were both in use at the same time, email routers had to deal 
with ambiguity.  Greg Chesson gave his email address as 
research!greg at Berkeley and that only worked from the ARPANET and systems 
running pathalias.
