Not sure which statements you are talking about that are incorrect.

Minix3 running on ME was in the news a few years back. See for instance: =
https://itsfoss.com/fact-intel-minix-case/ -- Websearch reveals many =
articles on IME + MINIX, hardly any to IPMI + MINIX.

MINIX 3 + NetBSD userland is pretty much what minix3.org website says!

[And no, I was not aware of who you work for.]

In any case, sounds like you were talking about something not =
(well)known outside of Intel.

nothing in M3 that IPMI is using other than it is the current version =
from Andy's team.  What IPMI has as an underlying uK is heavily hacked =
and is a 'derivative work' - the local uk is basically providing V7 =
interfaces to some special programs.=20

I think Tanenbaum's point was that MINIX3 is nothing like MINIX1 except =
in name.

and Minux was picked because it was smaller than any of the *BSDs and =

No argument here :-)
