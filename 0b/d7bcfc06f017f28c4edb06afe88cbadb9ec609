fmt was literally part of Mail - it compiled in the same source 
directory, and was considered user agent (UA) code. delivermail/sendmail 
was separate, also from Berkeley, but written primarily by Eric Allman, 
and was the mail transport agent (MTA). It's in 2.8BSD as well.

ex/vi didn't use overlays (unless you count split I/D). It fit in 64 
bits by using ifdefs.  Less useful code, like supporting upper-case-only 
terminals, would be ifdeffed out on the pdp11.
