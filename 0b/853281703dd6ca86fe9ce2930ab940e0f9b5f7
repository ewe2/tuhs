Subject: [TUHS] papers on the -mm macros?
Message-ID: <20060309022832.F98411@dynamite.narpes.com>


Hi,

I've found the documentation for most of the major
troff preprocessors and macros packages, but I can't
seem to find anything but occasional references to a
paper on the "Programmer's Memorandum Macros" (troff -mm)
by Smith and Mashey.

I'm hoping some of you may have better insight into
the matter...
