Subject: [pups] Req help rebuilding v7 rl2unix with dz driver added
Message-ID: <200210031840.g93IeGq15243@mindwarp.smart.net>

(running under simh V2.9-11)
I wanted to add the dz driver for multi-"terminal" support.  But I'm
a bit stumped figuring out how to rebuild rl2unix, let alone how to add
the dz driver.  (no rlconf/rl2conf file, although mkconf.c looks like maybe
it knows about the rl2 if not about the dz)

Is this do-able?  Is the dz driver in the v7 image usable?
