Another clarification - LBL has never been part of UC Berkeley. It's
(always?) been a Department of Energy laboratory managed by the Univ.
of California. On the other hand, many people, due the close proximity
of LBL to UC Berkeley, have appointments at both places so it can
be hard to recognize which place somebody was working at when certain
research was done. For example, both Van Jacobson and Steve McCanne
had affiliations with LBL and UC Berkeley.
