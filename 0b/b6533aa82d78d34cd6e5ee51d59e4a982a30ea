Consider: Webb Miller's 's'   - It been on my 'todo' list to get it running
on 6th edition, but I admit that is low on my priority list.  But I have
run it on a couple of other 8-bit systems

-- from the readme ---

# s
A tiny vi like screen editor

Original sources were published in this book:


Author:     Webb Miller

Title:      A software tools sampler

Publisher:  Prentice-Hall, Inc. Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA =C2=A91987

ISBN:       0-13-822305-X


Martin, a guy from one of my hangouts named <c.o.cpm>, located
the sources from this book. The repository starts from these
original sources. Martin also provided the initial CP/M patches
for compiling with HI-TECH C. Then the sources were overworked,
to get it compiled without warnings on old systems with K&R
C compiler, as well as modern systems with ANSI C compiler.

This version of s is known to compile on:

HI-TECH C for the Z80 under CP/M

clang under OSX

clang and gcc under Linux

Mark Williams K&R C compiler under COHERENT
