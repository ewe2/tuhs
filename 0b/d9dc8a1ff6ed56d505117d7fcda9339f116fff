And the 709 added CAS (compare accumulator with storage): it skips 0, 1, or 2 instructions depending on whether the contents of the accumulator are algebraically greater, equal, or less than the contents of the referenced memory location. (See page 49 of http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/709/709_RefMan_Fortran.pdf.)
