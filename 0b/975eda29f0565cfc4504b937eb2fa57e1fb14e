I've looked through my notes and unfortunately there's very little
about this as the notes are mostly about graphics and physics.

You're right I was a little early above, but the "merge" was not an
event. It was a process that went on for months, years even.

Dennis wrote the select we used, I'm almost certain of that. We (he
and I) talked about its design at the time, after a trip he made to
Berkeley about the DARPA Stuff. He had had many discussions with the
BSD work going on and wanted to couple it to the streams work to make
my graphical multiplexer work. Mpx was killing me (and killing the
kernel), but I'm nearly certain that I was using select (with our form
of pseudo-ttys) before or by very early 1982. I'm all but certain; we
gave up on mpx(2) very early.

Streams came later; Dennis's Show and Tell about them was early in 1982.

I'm not sure, but we may have booted London & Reiser's VAX port first,
but we moved to Berkeley code pretty early. We (Dennis mostly, but
others) were talking to Berkeley often. We didn't just wait for a
release; we were a part (not sure I could say now how important, but a
part) of it from early on.
