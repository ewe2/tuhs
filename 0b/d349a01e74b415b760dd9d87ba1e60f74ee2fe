Heh, I hadn't thought that TUHS itself should now be considered historical,
but I guess 25 years in the IT industry is a long time. A while back I
wrote an answer to this question here:

https://minnie.tuhs.org/Blog/2015_12_14_why_start_tuhs.html

I started the PDP-11 Unix Preservation Society mailing list around
October 1995. Eventually I realised that there needed to be a forum/group
with a wider remit, so I started a separate TUHS list in 2000. Some time
after that, the two lists got merged to be the single TUHS list.

Let me know if you have other questions.

Cheers, Warren
