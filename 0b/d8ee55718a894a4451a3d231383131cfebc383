Ah the "dmap" talk from the guys at Pitt in I think the winter 1980 USENIX
conference.

The story is that it was indeed an RT11 image.  The guys at Pitt hacked up
"enough" support for the 11 emulation mode on 4.1 to allow it to run.   The
project was referred to as "dmap manipulation" to keep it under the radar.
I can picture the face of the guy that did it, but I've forgotten his name.
  I fear it was early enough in USENIX time that there might not be
proceedings.
