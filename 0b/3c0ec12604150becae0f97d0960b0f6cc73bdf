You're missing the approach taken in Plan 9 (and
10th edition Unix): put related commands in a
directory and use a shell that doesn't restrict
the first argument of a command to a single path
element.

This lets you execute commands like:

	auth/as
	disk/prep
	git/rebase
	ip/ping
	ndb/dns
	upas/send

without having a prefix on every command name or
single large binaries with every command linked
in as subcommands.

Cheers,
  Anthony
