Subject: [pups] P11 emulator on the net
Message-ID: <200204111856.g3BIu4v22826@madison.onespeeddave.com>

If you want to play with Harti's p11
running 2.11BSD, you can telnet to
madison.onespeeddave.com on any of
ports 10001 through 10006.

I'll give you an account if you 
want one.  Just tell me what
userid and initial password you
want.  Also tell me what you'll do
with your account.

This flavor of the emulator is
running without a tape drive and 
a network interface card.

FWIF, madison is a 96MB P2-333 running NetBSD.
