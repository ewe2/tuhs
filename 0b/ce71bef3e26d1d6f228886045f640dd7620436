Or you could write a compiler that translates PDP-11 assembler to LLVM
intermediate language.  That was the technique used to port VMS to the
DEC Alpha and Intel Itanium.  A lot of VMS was in VAX assembler, so
DEC's compiler group wrote a compiler that took in VAX assembler and
generated IL for the GEM back end used by all of DEC's Alpha and
Itanium compilers.
