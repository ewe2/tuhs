Here is a question for the old hands from the Labs, I=E2=80=99m trying =
to get the timeline of some development steps right.

The two main things are: when did the 4.1 merge take place, and when =
were =E2=80=98streams=E2=80=99 added?

Going by file dates, the surviving 8th edition source appears to be from =
1985. I can see that a lot of files in /usr/include did not change after =
Jan 1982 (e.g. nlist.h). This suggests that early in 1982 the merge =
between 4.1 code and 32V code took place, to create the foundation for =
further development (=E2=80=9Cproto 8th edition=E2=80=9D, so to speak).

Similarly, there are a dozen or so files in the kernel that all have a =
file date of November 1982. The most interesting one of these is =
=E2=80=9Cdtline.c=E2=80=9D, a character mode Datakit driver: it uses =
=E2=80=98streams=E2=80=99. This suggests that there was a further code =
merge late in 1982 and implies that =E2=80=98streams=E2=80=99 were =
developed prior to that date.

=46rom the S/F-Unix papers it seems that =E2=80=98streams=E2=80=99 did =
not exist in 1981, at least they are not mentioned in an otherwise =
comprehensive set of papers. On the other hand, the S/F-Unix work was =
done in the Exploratory group, not the Research group: maybe it was =
inappropriate to mention.

All in all, my hypotheses would be that:
- the 32V/4.1 merge took place early in 1982=20
- =E2=80=98streams=E2=80=99 were developed in 1982 on 32V (maybe also =
V7) systems
- a further merge took place late in 1982 that combined the new base =
with latest developments

Does that sound correct, or was it all different?

Related is the question when the "file system switch" was added. It must =
have been later than 1981 and before 1985, but I have not been able to =
pinpoint it further.

Paul
