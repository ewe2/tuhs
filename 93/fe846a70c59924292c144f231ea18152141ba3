On the 12-bit PDP-8, the relevant addresses were 0010-0017; any indirect
reference through any such location was automatically preincremented.
However, they were hard to use in libraries, because allocation of this
incredibly scarce resource had to be manually managed, which meant in
effect that only the main program could use any of them, and because
PDP-8 programmers weren't in the habit of using them, they often were
simply ignored.  It was easy enough to add an extra ISZ (increment and
skip if zero) operation before the indirection.
