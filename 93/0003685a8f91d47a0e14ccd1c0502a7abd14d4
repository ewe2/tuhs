In RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.11 (without X-Window) I get:

$ ls<tab>
ls           lsattr       lsb_release  lshal        lspgpot

Whereas in Ubuntu 14.04 (full desktop install) I get:

$ ls<tab>
ls           lsblk        lscpu        lsdvd        lsinitramfs  lsof         lspcmcia     lss16toppm
lsattr       lsb_release  lsdiff       lshw         lsmod        lspci        lspgpot      lsusb

But then, in UnixWare 2.1 I get:

$ bash<enter>
bash-2.01$ ls<tab>
  (...no output...)

So yeah, it's getting more bloated by the day.

Anyone can contribute how is it on a recent OpenBSD without X-Window?
