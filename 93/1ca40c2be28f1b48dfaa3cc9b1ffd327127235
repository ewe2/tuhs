While the best loved feature is probably the pervasive dynamic linking, whic=
h is still unrivaled, and the security features (ring brackets, AIM (multile=
vel labeling), and ACLs) which are the most famous, a feature that isn't bui=
lt in to Unix and is constantly being reinvented that was available in Multi=
cs is the ability to easily set aside a CPU and some memory and disk, while l=
eaving the system in operation, and start another separate instance to do de=
velopment work, and then when the work is done, be reconfigured to merge the=
 system back into one instance, without disrupting production work. =20

That dynamic reconfiguration was one original design specifications of the s=
ystem, as opposed to being added later. Much of what makes Multics wonderful=
 to me is just how amazingly sturdily it's engineered and how complete the i=
mplementations of these ideas are.

Another thing to comes to mind immediately is how hierarchical the system is=
. For example, users are registered on to projects, and a project administra=
tor can be delegated the task of registering and deregistering user accounts=
 and managing the system resources such as disk quota and access to printers=
 and other physical resources for their project.=20

The system administrator can manage the resources assigned to projects, and t=
he project administration handles how that's further carved up amongst the u=
sers.

You can have similar granularity in assigning the distribution of resources s=
uch as CPU and memory use, by using the workload management features to ensu=
re that high priority tasks/users/projects will always have needed resources=
 available, preempting lower priority tasks if necessary.=20

The I/O system, (while not exceedingly elegant - see iox_), far exceeds what=
 is available in Unix today, but by design.

The reputation of Multics as a 'complex' system is, in my experience, well d=
eserved, but that complexity does not mean it's a terrible system to use or a=
dminister. I find it quite refreshing and it almost never feels dated.
