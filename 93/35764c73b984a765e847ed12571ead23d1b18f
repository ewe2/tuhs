In 1969 at the end of 9 th grade I got a foot injury that kept me on crutche=
s for the summer so I took summer school typing. very worthwhile. I think 90=
% of the class were young women. My parents encouraged it mostly because it w=
ould make  writing term papers much easier, which it did, but of course it h=
ad many computing benefits as well.
the ancient typewriters had really heavy keys with long strokes. Much like t=
eletypes.
