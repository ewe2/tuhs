Someone is offering me an 11/23 with (I think) 2 small disks
(RL-something) which are meant to bbe 10Mb each (maybe 5?)

Can someone tell me what Unices this will run?  It has no media other
than the disks (it has, I think, RT-11), but I've read about people
getting stuff into things down a serial line -- how practical is that?

Thanks
