I have:

g:	The original protocol from the 1970s

G:	enhanced g-protocol introduced by Svr4

d:	Protocol for DataKit connections.

e:	Protocol for TCP links from HDB UUCP, similar to t-protocol.
	BSD UUCP used an implementation from Arne Ludwig.

f:	Seven Bit protocol with checksums on the entire file at a time
	No protocol flow control, but XON/XOFF
	It only uses the characters between \040 and \176 (' '..'~')
	Written by Piet Beertema, CWI, Amsterdam, Sep 1984
	Modified for X.25 by Robert Elz, Melbourne Univ, Mar 1985

F:	flow control protocol similar to f-protocol.
	Written by Piet Beertema, CWI, Amsterdam, Sep 1984
	Modified for X.25 by Robert Elz, Melbourne Univ, Mar 1985
	Probably created from f-protocol by Carsten Borman TU-Berlin
	or by me (Jörg Schilling)

h:	A protocol similar to the t-protocol with no error checking.
	Apparently used for HST modems.

s:	High 's'peed protocol based on the g-protocol.
	Variable block sizes 32..4096 bytes, up to 7 windows
	Written by me (Jörg Schilling)

t:	Protocol for TCP links from BSD
	Most likely from Rick Adams

x:	Protocol for X.25 links

Jörg
