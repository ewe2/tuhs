This doesn't look like a PDP-11 model, more like MicroVAX II (enclosure)
model designator. Open the machine and make a list of the cards that are
inside. Look for the Mxxxx numbers and have a look at
pdp11-field-guide.txt (easy to find with your prefered web search
engine). Once you have determind the CPU type look around
http://www.tuhs.org/ I think there was a FAQ somewhere that listed what
versions of UNIX run on what models.
