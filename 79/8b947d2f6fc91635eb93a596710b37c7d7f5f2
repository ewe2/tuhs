Just to let everyone know,  Stephen Schultz was right:  I needed arp table
entries as he described.`

Thanks to him and Greg Lehey for their useful replies.

This is just an FYI for anyone playing with the Begemot P11 emulator ...

The default clock rate on P11 is 50 Hz.  While this corresponds to AC line
frequency in many parts of the world,  it is not correct for the
U.S.,  where 60 Hz is the norm.  Since PDP-11 Unix was developed in the
U.S.,  the bootable distributions probably assume a 60 Hz clock
also.  When the software and "hardware" disagree on clock rates,  problems
happen.

My emulated 11 had difficulties keeping accurate time until I discovered
the 50 Hz clock rate.  After I changed it to 60,  the emulator's time was
remarkably accurate!

If you want to change the default clock rate,  you can do so in the source
(look for the symbol "clock_rate" in "main.c"),  or you can just add

	set clock_rate 60

into your p11conf file.  This will override the default in the emulator
program.

Have fun -- I certainly am! :-)

Hi -

	Sure it does.  The FreeBSD 4.1.1 release notes say so  ;)
	Before that the 'if_tap.c' module was available (for some time)
	as a download that could be retrieved from the author's site.

	The reason for publishing an ARP entry on the hosting system is
	so that other systems on the LAN know how to get to the simulated
	11 via the P11 hosting system.   If the hosting system doesn't
	publish an ARP entry the gateway, etc won't know to send the packets
	to the machine running P11.

	I know it can't - I asked him about it :)   That's when I first 
	discovered that nothing was able to communicate with the simulated
	11 - the 11 will not send anything unless it's able to get a 
	response to its ARP request.   On the hosting side it would be 
	possible perhaps to use a "interface route" but 2.11 can not do that
	and will block waiting for an ARPREPLY.

	Yes, the bootable 2.11 distribution assumes a 60Hz clock.  That is
	easily changed though for folks that live in 50Hz areas.  Edit the
	kernel config file and change LINEHZ to 50.  The rest of the system 
	has been changed to ask the kernel for the clockrate so there shouldn't
	be any compiled in assumptions outside the kernel (if I overlooked
	any let me know and I'll fix it).

	Indeed it is accurate.   Earlier versions of P11 would lose time
	very rapidly if the PDP-11 was "busy" - but the latest version of
	P11 is fantastic at keeping time.  If you run 'ntpd' on the 11 the
	time stays even closer to "real".

Ah well, I still haven't used it.

I did that with a static route entry.

As I say, it's not that simple.  I used it without trouble for years.
Recently something broke, and I suspect it trashed my root file
system, and I haven't had time to go back and fix it.  Since others
have the rest running, it's obviously nothing fundamental.
