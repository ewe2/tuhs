At one time there was a set of application notes that described how
to build a PDP11 clone out of AM2901 bit slices.  I think that the
performance would have been approximately that of an 11/40, while
the time and effort and parts cost would have been prohibitive for
a one-off production.

It is barely possible that I have a set of those notes somewhere,
although it would take a very lucky random search to find them.
