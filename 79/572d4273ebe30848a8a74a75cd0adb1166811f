Subject: [TUHS] SCO sues IBM?
Message-ID: <200303111052.21237.wes.parish@paradise.net.nz>

Well, the impression I got from IBM re: AIX and Linux's relationship, was that 
they were going to give AIX a Linux makeover so that they could maintain an 
apparently unified Un*xish shop - as far as AIX and Linux _are_ Un*ces, that 
is!

How that gets interpreted as importing Un*x trade secrets into Linux, I have 
no idea.

I also thought IBM was going to allow some of their mainframe high 
availability ideas to influence Linux - not through direct porting of the 
code - VM/ESA is apparently written in PL/I, and I doubt that most Linux 
programmers would touch that with a barge-pole.  And a waldo at a workplace 
on a planet on the other side of the galaxy.  Or universe.

I myself wanted to get some information on the internal structure - ie, the 
part that gets passed between the SFS client and the Reusable Kernel Server - 
of the VM/ESA Shared File System way back when, and was told in no uncertain 
terms, not to bother trying.

I don't see SCO has much chance of doing anything except causing a bit of 
unwelcome disruption and - I hope - getting bought out at bargain basement 
prices by IBM and getting the entire Un*x source tree BSDed or LGPLed to stop 
all this useless nonsense at the "source".  Or at the "sauce", to give it a 
rather appropriate spin.
