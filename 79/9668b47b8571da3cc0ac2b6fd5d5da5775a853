I have to go through a bunch of finagling to reply to some lists, 
including this one, via Alpine.  At least if I select "reply all", I can 
just cut-and-paste the addresses.  I think it's configurable in the list 
manager daemon.

I do seem to remember it being a bigger pain with Google mailing lists.
