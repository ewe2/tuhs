I know of no other SCCS data, but let me make a remark that results from a 
recent discussion with Kirk Mckusick:

Kirk told me that the regents of UCB do not like the unmodified (original) SCCS 
history data to be published unless this is done with a written permission.
Currently only Kirk owns such a permission.

Kirk did however aks whether the GIT repo from CSRG would be OK as it contains 
hand made fixes for a disk crash and as it does not use the original meta data.
The result was that there is no problem with a different archive format.

Given that the recent (upcomming **) SCCS history format (SCCSv6) is not the 
original SCCSv4 format that was used in CSRG, it seems that using the hand 
crafted fixed and a conversion to SCCSv6 would be OK as well.

The advantage with the SCCSv6 history format is that you are able to convert it 
back to the SCCSv4 history format via:

	sccs -R cvt -d -V4 .

;-)

I am planning a SCCSv6 variant of the CSRG archives, but I need to manually fix 
the broken history files first. Note that this now may be a bit easier because

	sccs -R val -T

gives better warnings since a few years than the historic sccs did.


Note that a full SCCS history may be very helpful. Last year, I came up with 
some problems in the Bourne Shell and a SCCS history with delta comments from 
around 1983 would have been very helpful to understand some changes that 
introduced bugs.

I also recently was interested in knowing when waitpid() was introduced.

**) upcomming because support for project based commits and network support is 
not yet ready in sccs.

See http://sccs.sourceforge.net/man/sccsfile.4.html for a description of the 
SCCSv6 history format.
