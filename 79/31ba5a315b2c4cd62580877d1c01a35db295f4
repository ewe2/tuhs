_end is the end of the text segment. _edata same for the data. You can
create these two by just creating a file that defines them as symbols = .
And global. And link that file last. Though crt is supposed to have that.

_decmch is likely in m.s so maybe that's not included.  Iirc it should be
next to last...

You might already have files with these symbols... nm is your friend here...
