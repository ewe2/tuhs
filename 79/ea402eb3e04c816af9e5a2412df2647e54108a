Subject: [TUHS] Windows Notepad to support Unix line endings

Hardly ever use notepad, hardly ever used notepad. Especially since I
discovered notepad++ many years ago ( https://notepad-plus-plus.org )

Of course, I use what is handy for what I'm doing. 'vim' I use when I
want to do some 'manipulation :-)
