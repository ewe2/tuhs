Subject: [pups] Any SMP PDP11 platforms?
Message-ID: <20031127223817.GA94863@minnie.tuhs.org>

Hi all,
	I stumbled across this reference to a 1975 Masters thesis:

de Brito Meyer. W., and Hawley, J.A.. III. Munix. a multiprocessor version
of UNIX. Master's thesis, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, Calif.. 1975.
Description of dual processor Unix.

Can anybody tell me what PDP11 platforms around 1975 had multi-CPU
capability? Also, if anybody has further information about Munix,
please let me know!

Thanks in advance for any help. I've trawled thru the Unix Archive
with no results.

Cheers,
	Warren
