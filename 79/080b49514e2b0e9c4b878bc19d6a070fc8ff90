Thanks, that's a nice idea, but from what I experienced,
the portability of recent AT&T/Bell/Lucent/whatever code
is worse than the bugs in old code (eg. I could not get
ksh93 to compile, something in there just dumped core;
but then that's Unix, not Plan 9).

>(a) has an explicit license that will probably do for the BSD people

If it's the same licence as for 8c, then no, unfortunately.

>(b) already knows how to produce PostScript

That's a must for replacing the current oldroff (nroff).

>(c) can handle UTF-8 and 16-bit Unicode

That's pretty neat ;)
