Mark Wooding had an insightful observation in response to that paper: it's
relatively common in Unix to have oblivious intermediaries where it is
important that they pass on things like file descriptors and signal
dispositions. How would you implement nohup() in a spawn-based system?

[ Yorkbox-related tangent: the other day I was trying to find out more
about the JANET NRS (the hosts.txt-alike with names in uk.ac.cam format)
and all I could find out is that it was hosted at Salford on Pr1me
computers https://www.uknof.org.uk/uknof7/Reid-History.pdf ... the reason
for looking because I'm no longer providing secondary DNS for Salford. ]
