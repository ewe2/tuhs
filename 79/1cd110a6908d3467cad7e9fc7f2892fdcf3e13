Hey,

Does anyone have any of the floppies for OpenDesktop 2.0.0? Mine got
damaged in a dehumidifier failure before they got to California.  The
only survivor was of all things...the QIC-24 tape (which I have read
fine)

sco-tape> tar tf file0 | more
./tmp/_lbl/prd=odtps/typ=u386/rel=2.0.0a/vol=1

Anyone know a good starting point for attempting to install it in to a
VM? ;)
