I'll defend perl, at least perl4, vigorously.  I wrote a lot of code in
it on 20mhz SPARCs.  Yeah, like any kitchen sink language you have to
develop a style, but it is possible.  All of Solaris 2.0 development
happened under a source management system I wrote, NSElite, that was
almost 100% perl4.  There was one C program, that Marc might like,
that took 2 SCCS files that had the initial part of the graph in 
common but the recent nodes were different in each file, and zippered
them together into a new SCCS file that had the newer nodes on a 
branch.  It was F.A.S.T compared to the edit/delta cycles you'd 
do if you did it by hand.

My perl4 was maintainable, I fixed bugs in it quickly.

When it happened, perl4 was a God send, as much as I love awk, perl 
was far more useful for stuff that awk just didn't want to handle.
