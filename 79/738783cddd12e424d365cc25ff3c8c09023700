I think we had this argument before as well. It would be nice if you 
actually could point out where this is the case. I just went through 
that 1973 PDP-11/45 handbook, and all it says are "page" everywhere I look.
I also checked the 1972 PDP-11/40 handbook, and except for one mention 
of "segment" in the introduction part of the handbook, which is not even 
clear if it actually specifically refers to the MMU capabilities, that 
handbook also use the word "page" everywhere.

I also checked the PDP-11/20 handbook, but that one does not even cover 
any MMU, so no mention of neither "page" nor "segment" can be found.

Somehow I doubt it, but looking forward to your references... :-)
