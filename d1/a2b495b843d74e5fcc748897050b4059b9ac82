Performance wise, it might have been the first "steaming" protocol :-)  All it was concerned about was 1) don't send anything that looks like a PAD escape sequence, 2) just send bytes at the link.

The idea was that the PAD would flow control the session, so uucico just went into dumb mode and shovelled out the bytes.
