Lars,

You may want to look at the 4 surviving BBN tapes on Kirk McKusick=E2=80=99=
s DVD software collection. A small part of that is on the TUHS Unix tree =
page - see the 4.1BSD entry.

1. A history of NCP on the VAX at BBN can be found in the change log:
https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3DBBN-Vax-TCP/history

In short they started with 32V in the Fall of 1979, and ported UIUC=E2=80=99=
s NCP code to it in May 1980. They then moved to 4.1BSD in August and =
ported yet again. It would seem that the ports were fairly =
straightforward. Coding for TCP begins in January 1981.

2. Note that the BBN TCP worked over NCP as its primary transport. The =
driver is still there if you look through the surviving BBN tapes. Part =
of that code is on TUHS:
https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3DBBN-Vax-TCP/dev/acc.c
=
https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3DBBN-Vax-TCP/bbnnet-oct82/imp_=
io.c

It will take some effort, but probably the NCP VAX code can be =
reconstructed from the surviving PDP11 UIUC code and these BBN tapes =
(the file names in the change log match).

3. The BBN tapes also have some user level software: telnet, ftp, mtp. =
This code consists of straight NCP to TCP conversions and the source =
code has #ifdef=E2=80=99s for NCP and TCP. An example is here:
=
https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3DBBN-Vax-TCP/src/telnet/netser=
.c

Hope this helps.

Paul
