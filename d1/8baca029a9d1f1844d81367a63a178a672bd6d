I mistakenly thought /proc was Roger Faulkner's creation. A little bit of 
digging turned up this reasonable summary: 
https://blogs.oracle.com/eschrock/a-brief-history-of-proc

The best part is that it contains the references to the original papers
(links added by me):
T. J. Killian. Processes as Files. Proceedings of the USENIX Software Tools 
Users Group Summer Conference, pp 203-207, June 1984 [1]

R. Faulkner and R. Gomes. The Process File System and Process Model in UNIX 
System V. USENIX Conference Proceedings. Dallas, Texas. January 1991 [2]
