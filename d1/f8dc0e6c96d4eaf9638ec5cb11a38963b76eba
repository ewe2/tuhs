 Symlinks?   Surely  you jest.   Not in Version 7 or System V.

The idea was to keep root small for convenience in various stages of =
setup.   /usr was indeed intended to be a separate disk.   If you look =
at the early distributions like V7, you=E2=80=99ll find the /usr image =
was a separate tape file.
