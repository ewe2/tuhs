Me too, as they say.  I did the bootleg photocopying myself.

The first 11/20 I used had a Tektronix 4002 Graphics terminal
with it.  This was a storage tube, vector addressable.  But it also
had a complete ASCII terminal emulator built in, with diode matrix
character generator ROMs.  Also the best keyboard I ever used,
with magnetically-operated reed switches.  The Tek terminal used
a specially modified KL11 terminal interface, which did serial
communication to the CPU at something like 100k characters/sec.
This made the hard-copy TTY-based editor really easy to use, because
it could repaint the whole screen in a fraction of a second.
