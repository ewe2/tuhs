In the late 70s and early 80s, structured programming was on the
ascension, but had not completely captured the minds of all computer
scientists and programmers. (cf. Knuth's "Structure Programming with
Goto Statements" article.)

It was recognized that goto was not necessary if one had proper control
structures in a language (if/else, while), and that code with no (or
minimal) gotos was easier to read and understand.

So this kind of thing was "in the air" when Bourne wrote the V7 shell.
If he's on this list, it'd be nice to hear directly from the source. :-)

HTH,
