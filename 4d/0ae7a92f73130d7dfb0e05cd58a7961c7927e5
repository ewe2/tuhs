I support your policy, but I'd say the ARPA in ARPANET makes it at least
feasible to stick with Zulu time for related milestones.

The older I get, the more convinced I am that the "two hard things in
Computer Science" quote came from someone who never had to accurately
report the ages of events predating epoch time.

And I can say as a patriotic American, I did not truly understand the
desperate plight of being a foreigner until I was in Cape Town during
the Super Bowl.  After that I limited international travel to extremely
profitable endeavors; otherwise the ROI just isn't there.
