I've wondered about this in the past, the conclusion was that it is
something that is technically required by POSIX. There is a general
requirement that "regular builtin" commands [with no exception for cd]
"shall be implemented in a manner so that they can be accessed via the
exec family of functions as defined in the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1-2008 and can be invoked directly by those standard utilities
that require it (env, find, nice, nohup, time, xargs)."
