I documented the procedure to extract a program from XXDP and put a header
on it so that you can boot it from VTserver or a UNIX disk. It has been a
long time since I did this to ZRQCH0, so I practiced on the program that I
think Christos needs (ZRQBC1) and sent it to him.

There's a lot I don't know about the a.out header, so if someone can improve
my method, let me know.
