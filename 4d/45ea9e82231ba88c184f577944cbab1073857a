That appears to be a different pair of articles.  My quotation was
=66rom Wikipedia, which I believe to be correct I was working in the USA
in those days, and I saw the magazine in a bookshop in Austin TX.  I
stopped working there in December 1991.  Unfortunately I wasn't very
interested at the time ("who cares about BSD?").  Check the references
in the Wikipedia article.  Unfortunately the Dr. Dobbs site can't find
them.

May 1992 was significantly after the first release of 386BSD in March
1992.
