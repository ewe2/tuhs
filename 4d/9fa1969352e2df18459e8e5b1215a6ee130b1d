My understanding is that FAA rated 'ethernet' switches for aircraft
are modified ASICs which do TDM. You program in slot reservations, and
this is used to give bounded-time delivery guarantees for flight
critical stuff. Cheaper to make by modifying existing stuff, the
physical and link layer code is almost identical, its just put into a
timeslot regime. Its fully isochronous for the flight control and its
best effort delivery for the entertainment.

So, when people talk about the entertainment being 'isolated' its not
opto-isolated and its not airgap discrete switch isolated: the TDM
bitfield excludes the customers from talking in the timeslots for the
flight control logic.

I think the imputed hack, was to "see" the flight control sequences
because you can probably fake out read-side, and get passive view of
them if you can make the ports broadcast-receive. I am really
unconvinced anyone succeeded in write-mode into this model. Not that
it couldn't happen and not that I believe I'm smarted than bad people:
I just thing the descriptions have the quality of urban myth right
now.
