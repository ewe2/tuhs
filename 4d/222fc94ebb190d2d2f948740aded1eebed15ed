Thanks, patched!  :-)  And yes, I agree that you weren't arguing for the
impending relevance of Hurd.  Nevertheless, at the time, there were
people making the argument that Hurd would Real Soon Now make
Linux irrelevant.

I haven't seen reference to Bushnell in a long time; looks like he has
shifted to ecclesiastical matters.  He was up to some interesting
software things, once upon a time.

The tales of Stallman being stubborn are not rare.

It's interesting that perhaps BSDI was a reason for GNU avoiding 4.4-Lite.
That points to why the "what might have been" is very troublesome to track
down.  Alternatives always interact with one another...

Yeah, there's dysfunction everywhere :-).

Over the years, I have heard BSD folk blasting Linux over Linus' occasional
lack of tact; that is very much a road MORE travelled by a great many
projects.  Hurd's challenges starved it of staff, definitely unhelpful.
BSD had both amicable as well as ridiculously non-amicable forks.

It's not at trivial to get the right balance and plenty easy for missteps
to lead to disaster.

As vast overgeneralizations of the extremes, pure diplomats don't get
anything done, whilst jerks don't get enough help to support upgrading to
the next generation of motherboards/disk drives/graphics cards.  Successful
systems fall somewhere in between.

When confronted by a difficult problem, solve it by reducing it to the
question, "How would the Lone Ranger handle this?"
