Late to answer...

As far as I remember, Clem's description is correct. The filesystem
itself stores only one owner and one group ID. When checking access
to the file, the file owner is checked to see if the user ID matches.
If so, then the owner permissions are applied. If not then the group
array associated with the user is used to decide if the group of the
file matches one of the groups of which the user is a member and if
so the group permissions apply. Otherwise the other permissions are
used.

In BSD, the group assigned to the file is assigned from the group of
the directory in which it is created. The setgid flag can be set only
if that group is a member of the user's group array. The user can only
change the group ID to one that appears in their group array.

Until multiple group sets were added to System V, the group of the
file was taken from the gid assigned to the user at login.
