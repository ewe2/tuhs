I had a similar conversation btw.  I liked what Dennis did to clean up the
tty handler but I agree as a networking interface it was wretched which is
what system v did.    At stellar we put in the bbn (walsh2) stack and
spliced back in sockets so the bsd code still worked.
That said the idea of trying to keep the everything is a file semantic was
good and streams were closer. The problem sockets is they really were not
quite The same.

What I liked about plan 9 was breaking the control interface out so the
file stuff stayed sane.   But that was a bridge to far for a traditional
Unix.
