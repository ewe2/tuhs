I know people that did unnatural things to upgrade the Sun 3/50 to
something that had enough memory not to suck. Oh, and to have real
disks, rather than the crazy SCSI to ESDI disks that had performance
only marginally better than floppy drives....   IIRC, the hard part
was getting a VME "cage" to allow other cards to in inserted, which
killed the pizza-box implementation of the 3/50. But it's been a long
time since that happened, and maybe I'm misremembering. Maybe that was
only possible with the 3/60.
