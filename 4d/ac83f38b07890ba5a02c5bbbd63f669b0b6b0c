DR's Concurrent DOS 286 was multiuser, but never really made it in
the market in that form due to the issues they had with the 286.

It eventually became FlexOS, but was not really DOS compatible
once it that form.  There was a DOS compatible add-on for the
386 varient of FlexOS, which hints at how limited the DOS
compatibilty of CDOS 286 would have been.

Note that CDOS 286 (aka FlexOS) was a distinct product from
Concurrent DOS.  The former written in C; the latter in assembler
and seemingly derived from Concurrent CP/M.
