Clem, I am respectful of you and of all the list members from whose
experience and direct contact with "primordial Unix" I try to constantly
learn.

I, however, try to express opinion on the "openness" of Unix (post
V7). Nobody has been able to write a Unix from scratch without having had
access to the Unix source code: Tannenbaum had access to the Unix sources
before writing Minix, Linus had access to Minix source before writing
Linux, and in Dennis Ritchie's opinion Coherent was a "rewritten Unix"
done with the Unix sources printed next to the keyboard ("some parts
were written with our source nearby, but at least the effort had been
made to rewrite").

GNU rewrote all the surrounding Unix tools from scratch, that's true,
but they could not a kernel make.

So much for "openness of concepts".

It's the source that matters. Anything else, is ivory-towerism.

Post Lions' book being forbidden, Unix can boast little openness.
