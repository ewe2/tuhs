DEC did do a Pascal for RSX.  I don't remember if it supported RT11 or
RSTS.  DEC did a BASIC compiler for RSTS and RSX.  RSX and especially
RT were designed mainly for real-time process control in laboratories.
   A lot of the programming was in assembler for efficiency reasons
(both time and space).
