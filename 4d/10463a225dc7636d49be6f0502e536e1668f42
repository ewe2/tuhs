Well done,
My 83 has 2 RD54s it is a nice configuration.

As to your other query about the boot loader saying that it is an 83 as opposed to
a 73.  The response that you have had is correct AFAIK. My 83 was a 73 before I
changed the processor and I had a similar conversation with Steve Schultz.  If it
is a quad board then the boot loader is doing as well as it can :-)

Have fun

Robin

It's amazing what happens when you follow the directions - thanks for your
help, folks.  I have 2.11BSD up and running on my 11/73 (booted off the
disk, even), and it's currently untarring the last big chunk of /usr/src.
(The docs mention that TK50s are slower than snot - believe it!)  The system
has two RD54s <woohoo!>, but I'm following the 'default' installation for
now until I have everything running and have successfully rebuilt the
kernel; then I'll probably move /usr and /tmp over to the second RD.  I also
need to dig into the machine a bit more - the bootloader tells me I have an
11/83, so I'm suspecting the CPU was changed at some point.

For the record, I live in Seattle, and I can now produce bootable TK50s with
2.11BSD.  :-)
