It is going to be very difficult.  If this is real HW you might try practici=
ng configuration using simh.     It will be faster and easy to play with unt=
il you have the config that meets your needs.         That said for telnet a=
nd ftp you are going to need tcp.=20

Btw.  I might suggest setting up and Arduino, an RPi or the like and connect=
 via serial ports to the 11.  That way you might not need networking.   =20
