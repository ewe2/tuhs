I became troff buddies with him.  I love troff and all the other tools,
pic especially because you can read pic code and see the picture in your
head.  Richard and I shared that love for pic.  He and I talked quite a 
bit about how to do stuff in troff.  Troff buddies is the best way to
describe what we had, we bonded over that but I wasn't close to him 
otherwise.  Still miss him and our troff exchanges, he was a great 
guy, those books were the best in their day.

He was a lot like Dennis, willing to talk to you and educate you if you
had a clue.
