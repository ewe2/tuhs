I suspect they would be horrified that more progress hadn't been made 
in computing environments in the last 25 years :)

In 1979, I was pretty excited when I thought about what computers could 
be like in the early 2000s.  We all love to preserve history, but 
there's something to be said for moving on and creating something new 
as well.
