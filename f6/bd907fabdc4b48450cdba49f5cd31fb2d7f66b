One thought about Digital Ocean is they even have a web browser based graph=
ic console so you get to fix things @ single user yourself as well as run X=
 remotely if needed...=20

Indeed, that's cheap. When I started out back in ... thinking .... '99=20
with my first own domain, there were not that many offerings for hosting=20
at the cost for (then) DSL plus static IPs. Had there been offerings=20
this low back then I might have opted for that.

But, I liked the way to have physical control over my setup, still do,=20
so there was, is no reason to switch at this time. Given different=20
circumstances, I might.
