We will generally be sending messages about it to the CCTalk list (for
collectors of 'classic' computers), so if you want to be notified about it,
sign up there.

We currently have only wire-wrap prototypes (the FPGA is on an off-the-shelf
daughter-card); we're hoping to produce PCB production versions 'soon'. We do
have the technology for getting PCB's, which we have used for doing 'indicator
panels':

We have those working (they've been a big help in debugging, actually :-), and
they'll be available too. I don't personally have one of them yet, I'm
_really_ looking forward to watching the lights blink as UNIX boots... :-)

No, AFAIK the /23 and /23-PLUS are effectively identical, as far as the QBUS
goes. (Obviously the -PLUS has devices, etc, the plain /23 doesn't, but they
don't enter into whether our board will work with one.)

We also plan at UNIBUS version; the two busses are similar enough that we'll
probably start with a PCB version for that one.

Sure; use CCTalk.
