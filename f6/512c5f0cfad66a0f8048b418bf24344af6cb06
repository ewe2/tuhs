You wouldn't need a decrement per access, because the base itself could
still be stored as the address of the "0th" element (i.e. what would be
the "-1th" in a 0-based system). It might add some extra complexity to
the relocator, if it's not currently possible to have a reference
outside the bounds of an object and/or with a negative offset, but
statically linked programs (the only kind on V7 and earlier) did not do
any runtime relocation.
