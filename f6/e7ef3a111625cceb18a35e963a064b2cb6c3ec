Subject: [TUHS] 2.11BSD mirror
Message-ID: <20151214095115.GA16979@minnie.tuhs.org>

Hi all, I've been in contact with Steven Schultz and I've set up a
mirror of his 2.11BSD patches at:

http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/ucb/2.11BSD/Patches/

I have no "git fu", but it would be nice to have a Git repository
with all the sources fully patched. Oh, and new boot tapes :-)
I should ask Santa for it.

Cheers, Warren
