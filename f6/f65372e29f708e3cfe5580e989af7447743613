I still don't get what was so bad about TECO.

*20t$$
<20 lines of text>
*fs<text to search for>$<text to replace it with>$$
*0lt$$ ; type current line to review what you've changed.

Very simple.

*<fstextsearch$textreplace$>$$

replace all occurrences of textsearch.

Now, of course, searching for something like a regular expression was 
much harder.

Q-registers, all sorts of cool stuff.

But then, maybe I'm talking about a later version of TECO than you all. 
I think I was on version 22 on TOPS-10 6.03A
