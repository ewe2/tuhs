I was thinking about Star Wars this morning and various parodies of it (like
Ernie Foss's Hardware Wars) and I rememberd the old DEC WARS.   Alas when I
tried to post it, it was too big for the listserv.   So here's a link for
your nostalgic purposes.   I had to find one that was still in its
fixed-pitch glory complete with the ASCII-art title.
