There are two kinds of people in this world.  Those that think that adding
more is better (more is more approach), and those that think the complete
opposite (less is more approach).  The second type is usually associated
with minimalistic philosophy and approach to life.  I believe Ken and the
team were the masters of minimalism.

Today the only current OS that I can think of that still adores this
minimalistic approach is probably only OpenBSD.  Even its installer is as
minimal as you can get... I really like it.
