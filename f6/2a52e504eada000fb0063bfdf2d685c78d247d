V4 to V6 had this limit of 512 bytes. It's documented in exec(2),
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V4/man/man2/exec.2
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V6/usr/man/man2/exec.2
and the code is in sys1.c, e.g. E2BIG,
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V5/usr/sys/ken/sys1.c

V7 then also implemented NCARGS (sys/param.h).

I can't read assembler and tried to find the limit in a running V1
http://code.google.com/p/unix-jun72/
with a script which just echoes its arguments, and found
- command line (script or interactive) not longer than 255 characters
- single argument not longer than about 82 characters  (how this might have come off?)
Exceeding this lead to data corruption or kernel crash.

Early exec(2) reads
V1: The arguments are placed as high as possible incore: just below 60000(8).
V3: The arguments are placed as high as possible in core: just below 57000(8).
and I wonder if it's possible to determine limits from this.
