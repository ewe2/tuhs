>has anyone had success getting a TSV05/TS05 working under 2.11BSD?

The TSV05 is a TS11-emulating interface, like the TU80 and Emulex
TC03 and Emulex TC13 (in TS11 mode) and the Dilog DQ132 etc.
While I've used 2.11BSD with TU80's and TC03's and TC13's and DQ132's
and they all worked, I've never actually used a real TSV05 under
2.11BSD.

I'd be inclined to say you've got a hardware problem before
blaming the 2.11BSD driver.  Can you test your TSV05&TS05 with a
different OS?  (RT-11, RSX, VMS?)

Tim.
