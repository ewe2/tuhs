Heh.  I had a similar experience when writing "Porting Unix Software"
(1995).  O'Reilly insisted on using groff with their macro set, and I
had only had experience with (La)TeX.  I fought for quite some time,
but ultimately gave in.  Despite Baby Duck Syndrome, I discovered that
I far preferred groff to TeX, and I've been using it ever since.

   More than anywhere else in porting, it is good for your state of mind to=
 steer
   clear of
   .TXI \&
   internals.  The assumptions on which the syntax is based differ markedly=
 from
   those of other programming languages.  For example, identifiers may not =
contain
   digits, and spaces are required only when the meaning would otherwise be
   ambiguous (to
   .TXI ,
   not to you), so the sequence \s10\f(CWfontsize300\fR\s0 is in fact the
   identifier \s10\f(CWfontsize\fR\s0 followed by the number \s10\f(CW300\f=
R\s0.
   On the other hand, it is almost impossible to find any good solid inform=
ation in
   the documentation, so you could spend hours trying to solve a minor prob=
lem.  I
   have been using
   .TXI \&
   frequently for years, and I still find it the most frustrating program I=
 have
   ever seen.\**

I solved that issue in later documents with two passes in the Makefile
targets, frobbing things like references and contents in between.
