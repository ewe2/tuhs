It's a cool idea, but I think it depends.  That would be a bit like  
making a vintage car.  People do that (even without the intention to  
fake them - there are, I think, many more type 35 Bugattis in  
existence than were ever made), but sometimes you want a vintage car,  
or computer, because it's vintage.
