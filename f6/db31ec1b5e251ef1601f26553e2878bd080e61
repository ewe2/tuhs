Hello!
Jason I don't mean to cause rain on your parade here, but we've
practically beaten the idea behind running the 4BSD series via VAX
(emulation) numerous times. And even after regular packet based
networking rather then hardware based (!) was added to the software. I
should say that networking of some sort was added to SIMH. But you get
the idea.

Your ideas are admirable and I believe you've got a good idea here,
but we need time to study it.

Please watch this space.
