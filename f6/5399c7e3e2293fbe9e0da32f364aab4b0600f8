Warren,

Good news so far.  I did some work on VTserver 2.0, and added the uODT code
so it
uploads the PDP-11 boot code to the machine and gets it going.  That works
fine..
"copy" gets loaded, and I can transfer stuff from and to the machine's RX50
and 
RD51 units.

My biggest worry next, of course, is using an emulator to emulate my machine
(which
is a MicroPDP-11/23, by the way) and its disks, and build a working set of
file 
systems.  Those I can then transfer to the raw disk.

When playing, I noticed that the RD51 is a plain Seagate ST412 MFM drive...
did anyone
try to use other MFM disks with the RQDX series controllers?  I can probably
get some
very cheap ST251 40MB drives.. ;)

I've done exactly the same thing (but it only was an ST225, AKA RD31) on
an RQDX3 controller. You need the XXDP 2.5 diagnostic kit for that. Having
a couple of 5.25" HD diskdrives really helps. Some of these drives (the
older, the better ;) can be used as RX33 drive, which greatly reduces the
problem of creating a XXDP bootdisk with the needed utilities, since you
can write these disks in a (second :) 5.25" drive on a standard PC. 

Finding a supply of 1.2 MB 5.25" disks can be a bigger problem - I'm 
very happy with my newly found pack of *fresh* disks.

I may still have such a diskimage floating around somewhere (Yup, I seem
to have). The basic idea is to low-level format the MFM drive, and make it
look like a genuine DEC drive. This is a lot easier if the drives you
want to use were also sold as DEC drives (which is the case with the
ST251 - it's also known as the RD32). If not, you'll have to provide
a lot more information about the drive - never really tried that. 

This said, I sucessfully low-levelled a 21MB Miniscribe (with the same
CHS-layout as a ST225) using the RD31 parameters.

Could this be placed in the archive? It would be nice to have this
public available.

I connected a generic Mitzumi 5.25" FDD to the RQDX3 in my MicroVAX III
and it just worked. Even booting from it was no problem.

Hi.

I have two PDP11/73 CPUs (M8192). On one module is the 40 pin socket
empty. On the other module is a 40 pin Chip labeld 21-21858 in the
socket. What chip is that?

I thought the FPU is part of the J11 chip? Or is this extra chip just
faster?
