Maybe I=E2=80=99m just missing something.  But it=E2=80=99s not intuitive a=

Probably not the reason, these machines were fully and publicly
documented.  In fact, there is still a book in print on the ROS
residual data and firmware runtime services.  Most of the register
info was in "Hardware Technical Information" manuals that were
publicly ordered from IBM Publications (I have these).  And in fact I
provided this info and it was used to bring up NetBSD in the mid
2000s.
