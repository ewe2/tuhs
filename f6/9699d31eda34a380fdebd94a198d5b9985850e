That was a good read and a perspective on Unix that I've not seen before.
I sort of fit with the author's view, I like to read and I like to write.
I am much happier typing than clicking.

Don't get me wrong, I live on Linux and it has made some stuff pleasantly
clickable.  I use virtual desktops, I have 6 of them.  There are xterms 
in 5 out of 6, the last one has firefox.  I click but I mostly live in
terminal windows.  Which are all 80 columns because that's the right
width (I can go on and on about that).
