Not really.  Programmers need windows side by side.  Lots and lots of bit
mapped displays can handle 2 80 column windows at a reasonable font size.

And I made the point about side by side diff tools.

And I made the point about being able to read down the center and get the
rest through peripheral vision.

Would I like wider?  Not really, at this point the vast majority of the
code I look at, the man pages and other docs I look, they all fit in 80
columns.  Sure, you could pick something else but you are just fighting
reality.

It's like video on phones.  We still call it taping.  Probably still will
in a 100 years.  Where's the tape?  In history.
