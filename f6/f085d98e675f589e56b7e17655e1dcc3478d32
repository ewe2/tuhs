<aside> When people wonder why digital archiving and preservation is so
incredibly hard -- situations like this perfectly illustrate why. </aside>

More on topic though: I'm a typographer with an interest in markup
languages, since I used them commercially in the 1980s (mostly TeX, but
with a large personal macro library, hence invoking the problem above,
if the source documents had even been archived, which they were not --
an even more basic problem).

I'm interested in reading John Labovitz' history, for sure.
