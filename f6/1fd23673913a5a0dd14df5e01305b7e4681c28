I frequently figured out a way to make it so that the grunt-and-pokers 
felt like it behooved them to learn how to do things on their own.  The 
likely suspects are 1) faster response time (I came in later than they 
did) and 2) it saved money in that they didn't have to wait on me and I 
didn't have to delay work on other projects.  Thus the (sometimes 
begrudgingly) agreed that learning how to turn on the overhead lights 
was better than waiting on me to come in and do it later.  (Effectively 
speaking.)
