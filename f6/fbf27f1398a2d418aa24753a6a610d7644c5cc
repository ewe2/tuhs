I'm curious, will gcc on a modern Linux system compile K&R c?

Maybe when I get a little time, I might try to see if I can compile it
on a modern Fedora 21 system with gcc. 

BTW: Great job introducing him to such a classic environment. A few
years ago, my now 18 year old had expressed some interest in graphics
programming and was in awe over an SGI O2 I had at the time, so I got
him an Indy.  He played around with a bit of programming, but
unfortunately, he lost interest.
