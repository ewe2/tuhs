qemu has a 'user mode' that lets one implement the 'kernel' inside
qemu so that you can execute mips binaries on an x86 with full
awareness of the host's filesystem, but with enough 'special case
hooks' that things like shared libraries use the mips .so rather than
the x86 .so. It emulates a bunch of systems, but none of them
pdp-<anything>. It has both BSD and Linux user-mode support, and
FreeBSD uses it to build armv7, armv8, mips and powerpc packages on
x86_64 hosts.
