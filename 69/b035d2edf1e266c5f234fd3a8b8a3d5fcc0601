I'd also warn that 4.1c as originally distriuted  has some serious bugs like crashing when it receives ICMP redirects.    We had just brought our systems up when they crashed and then it crashed an hour later and the phone rang and it was Louis Mamakos of UofM who was playing with their fuzzballs and pinged our system.
