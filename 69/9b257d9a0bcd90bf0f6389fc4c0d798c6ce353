Here's the full explanation:

Sounds beyond me, and not necessary at this stage.

The 256kB card is:
M8067-KA MSV11-PK 256-kbyte MOS memory with parity CSR
 I'll keep that for the '23+.

Can you clarify something for me regarding memory? I understand the bottom
area of memory in a Unix system is for the Kernel and it's stuff, and that
the top 8kB is set aside for device I/O (with the exceptions you mentioned
in a previous email about using some of that space). The LSI-11 board has
4kW of RAM on it, and I have already a 16KW board. If I want to further
expand the RAM, and say I buy another 16kW board, that makes an arithmetic
sum of 32kW for the boards, making 36kW total. Can the 4kW of on-board RAM
be disabled, and only the 32kW on the boards be used? Is it ok for the
installed RA mto overlap the 8kW at the high memory area? Do the devices
spoof these addresses or do they read/write in the high installed RAM area?
