=2E.. and I am very happy that I found my way into a different feedback
loop, called Unix philosophy ... with sources meant to be read, great
documentation, and books that actually feature real life code (already
a thing by itself) but also that the production code is on the same
``acts as a good example'' level.

If programmers have never experienced such wonderful worlds -- how
poor their programming lifes must be!
