Not. Plan 9 developed a significant dependency of its original compilers.
Plan 9 cc is a caller compiler so main parts of the code couldn't work now
adapted in Harvey for gcc, clang and icc (intel) that are all callee. But
it's not a C problem, it's a compiler issue. Probably with Steve's pcc you
could too. Nerver tried, but it could be a good experiment.
At the end is extremely difficult not to be at any point toolchain
dependent, if Plan 9 original compilers could be improved enough to build
an standard ANSI program out of the tree (they are strongly dependent of
Plan 9 environment), also the Plan 9 code, that way you're suggesting would
be possible.
Anyway, for that, you wouldn't need any preprocessor code, also you
needen't to build amd64 or riscv with the same sources.
