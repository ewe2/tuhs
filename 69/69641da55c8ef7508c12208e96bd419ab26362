Derrik, you're missing the point: what's the fun of doing it the easy
way?  :-)  Seriously, though, I think you'd have a couple of serious
problems: the assembly language components (which are not inconsiderable
in V6) would need to be rewritten, and then there's also the question of
whether you could find a sufficiently "undisciplined" C compiler to
handle pre-ANSI C, to build the rest of the system.

Wouldn't it be easier to just get the PDP-11 emulator from 
gatekeeper.dec.com and compile it for HP-UX or Linux on the 712?  I've 
compiled it on Solaris 8, Linux, and Mac OS X, so it should compile just

fine under HP-UX.

Also, as far as I am aware ( and keep in mind, I am an HP-UX system 
admin. ) HP-UX has only ever been System V. You can run HP-UX, Linux, or

NetBSD on a HP-9000/{800,700}.
