I'm still happily experimenting with my combination of a V6 kernel with =
the 1981 tcp/ip stack from BBN, for example figuring out how one would =
write something like 'ping' using that API. That brought me to pondering =
the origins of the 'alarm()' sys call and how some things were done on =
the Spider network.

These are my observations:

1. First of all: I understand that early Unix version numbers and dates =
mostly refer to the manual editions, and that core users had more =
frequent snapshots of a constantly evolving code base.

2. If I read the TUHS archive correctly, alarm() apparently did not =
exist in the original V6 edition of mid-1975. On the same basis, it was =
definitely there by the time of the V7 edition of early '79 (with =
sleep() removed) - so alarm() would seem to have appeared somewhere in =
the '75-'78 time frame.

3. The network enhanced NCP Unix versions in the TUHS archive have =
alarm() appear next to sleep(). Although the surviving tapes date from =
'79, it would seem to suggest that alarm() may have originated in the =
earlier part of the '75-'78 time frame.

4. The Spider network file store program 'nfs' (source here: =
http://chiselapp.com/user/pnr/repository/Spider/dir?mtime=3D0&type=3Dflat&=
udc=3D1&ci=3Dtip) uses idioms like the below to avoid getting hung on a =
dead server/network:

	signal(14,timeout); alarm(30);
	if((read(fn,rply,100)) < 0) trouble();
	alarm(0);

The 'nfs' program certainly was available in the 5th edition, maybe even =
in the 4th edition (the surviving 4th edition source code includes a =
Spider device driver). However, the surviving source for 'nfs' is from =
1979 as well, so it may include later additions to the original design.

5. Replacing sleep() with alarm() and a user space library routine seems =
to have happened only some time after alarm() appeared, so it would seem =
that this was an optimization that alarm() enabled, and not its raison =
d'=EAtre.

So here are some questions that the old hands may be able to shed some =
light on:

- When/where did alarm() appear? Was network programming driving its =
inception?

- Did Spider programs use a precursor to alarm() before that? (similar =
to V5 including 'snstat' in its libc - a precursor to ioctl).
