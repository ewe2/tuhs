I don't insist on it.  It was just my reckoning to get things going,  that
a floppy as an RK would be enough.

Re-reading that last mail of mine,  I see that my mind kind of meandered.
So to be honest - I think you could well be right.

I don't see any particular reason not to do so.  I was attempting to
openly straighten my own thoughts out (perhaps thinking out loud is not
the best plan) and suggest that initially an RK - floppy would be a start,
and that RP - hard disk could be done later.
