Yup.  Instead of the splintering we have had with *BSD, I think it would
have drawn everyone in to work on that OS.

I have regrets in my life.  Not getting SunOS out there as open source
is one of the big ones.  I fought for it, perhaps harder than anyone
else.  Which perhaps makes me the bigger loser since I didn't win.

The world would be a better place if that had happened.  Linux is fine 
but it lacks what SunOS had.
