The omniscient Norman seems to have nailed me:

I suspect that in v7 (where .thing was indeed listed by default)
we decided that since .thing was a real file in the
directory it was better to list it instead of hiding it
by default.  (Seeing . and .. seemed  seldom interesting,
however).

I was solely (and much more recently) responsible for the lack
of subject header in my earlier reply.
