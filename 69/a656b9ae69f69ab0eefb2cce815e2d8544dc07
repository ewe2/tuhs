I agree that text mode MUAs from before the turn of the century do have 
a LOT more functionality than most GUI MUAs that came after that point 
in time.

Thankfully we are free to use what ever MUA we want to.  :-)

I've frequently found things that MUAs (and other applications) don't do 
properly.  That's when it becomes a learning game to see what subset of 
the defined standard was implemented incorrectly and deciding if I want 
to work around it or not.

Cookies are their own problem as of late.  All the "We use 
cookies...<bla>...<bla>...<bla>...." warnings that we now seem to have 
to accept get really annoying.  I want a cookie, or more likely a 
header, that says "I accept (first party) cookies." as a signal to not 
pester me.

Why do you have to let go of one tool?  Why can't you use a suite of 
tools that collectively do what you want?

You can keep the brain implant.  I have a desire to not have one.

Why do you have to give up one tool to start using a different tool?

I personally use Thunderbird as my primary MUA but weekly use mutt 
against the same mailbox w/ data going back 10+ years.  I extensively 
use Procmail to file messages into the proper folders.  I recently wrote 
a script that checks (copies of) messages that are being written to 
folders to move a message with that Message-ID from the Inbox to the 
Trash.  (The point being to remove copies that I got via To: or CC: when 
I get a copy from the mailing list.)

It seems to be like I'm doing things that are far beyond what 
Thunderbird can do by leveraging other tools to do things for me.  I 
also have a handful devices checking the same mailbox.

I *LOVE* threaded views.  I've been using threaded view for longer than 
I can remember.  I can't fathom not using threaded view.

I believe I mistook your statement to mean that you wanted to thread 
based on Subject: header, not the In-Reply-To: or References: header.

How does my use of DMARC irritate the list-reply mechanism of your MUA?

DMARC is completely transparent to message contents.  Sure, DKIM adds 
headers with a signature.  But I don't see anything about DKIM's use 
that has any impact on how any MUA handles a message.

Or are you referring to the fact that some mailing lists modify the 
From: header to be DMARC compliant?

Please elaborate on what you mean by "DMARC irritate the list-reply 
mechanism of your MUA".
