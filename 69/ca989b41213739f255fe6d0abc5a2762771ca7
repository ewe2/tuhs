Subject: [pups] /bin/ps (and /var/run/psdatabase) corrupt in installation set?
Message-ID: <20010207212252.B28455@mud.stack.nl>

Oy.

I kind of solved my problems with ps, just by recompiling the 
source.. I think I've got reasons to believe that /bin/ps as distributed
in the installation set on minnie is corrupt; it only dumps core.

As a side note, /var/run/psdatabase is corrupt too; normally this wouldn't
matter (since ps -U recompiles this, and since ps -U is run in /etc/rc),
but since ps dumps core...

Anyway; If I would've known about /var/run/psdatabase, it might have 
prevented me from searching a non-existant bug during the last few months :)
