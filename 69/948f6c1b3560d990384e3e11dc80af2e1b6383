Clever though those anecdotes may be, it was much easier to become
root. Sometime around 1981, I was visiting USG and they were in a bit
of a panic, checking that their system was intact. Why? Because early
that morning, there was a phone call to the machine room:

"Hi, this is Ken. What's the root password?"

The call was successful.

Any sysadmin worth his paycheck would have known that Ken isn't awake
in the mornings and could have blocked this interloper. But...

  I don't know how or when he first installed it, but I suspect he was awar=
