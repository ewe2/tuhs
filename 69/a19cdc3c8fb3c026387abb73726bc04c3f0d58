There was a missing branch instruction when copying from kernel buffer to 
userland buffer on page e08-02.  I added the branch and a note about it 
and committed.  (without the branch it will only ever copy one byte to 
userland).  Now my cold boot is writing files off the tape onto the rk0 
image.
