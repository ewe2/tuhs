Hi, folks. Tom Lyon here - this UNIX 370 stuff was recovered by Stephen at
LCM+L from DECtapes that I've had sitting around for 40+ years.
You can read all about the Princeton/Amdahl project here:
https://akapugs.blog/2018/05/12/370unixpart1/

If anyone wants to get serious with the code, you'll need Hercules with a
VM/370 image as well as a PDP-11 emulator running V6. There's not a lot
beyond the kernel, I got the shell working enough to prove that fork
worked, and then ran out of steam because of the awful communication
problems between the PDP and the IBM.  [ But that was my start as a
networking guy ]. I personally haven't had time to do anything with the
recovered bits.

I've been lurking on TUHS for a while - a special Hi to Ken Thompson and
Steve Johnson. I owe a lot to each of them. Read about my summer at Bell
with the Interdata 8/32 here: https://akapugs.blog/2018/05/16/belllabspart1/
