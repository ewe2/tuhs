That old, the issue is not going to be the format (TAR is still grokkable),
but the physical condition of the tapes; that old, they might have issues
with shedding of oxide, etc (which a heat soak can mostly cure). If you
really want them read, I would recommend a specialist in reading old tapes;
it will cost, but if you really want the data... I have used Chuck Guzis, in
Washington (state) in the US.
