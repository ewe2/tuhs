I think that connection is plain.  As for the .z extension, I'd guess (and
it's nothing better than that, just a conclusion I jumped to long ago) that
it makes compressed files sort after files that share the same root name.

IIRC, compress(1) used to be able to unpack files as well as uncompressing
them.  I don't know if that's still true.
