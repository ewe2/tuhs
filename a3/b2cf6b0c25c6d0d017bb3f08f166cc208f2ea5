That was just a guess on my part as to the exact cause. It is definite,
though, that Q22 memory won't work with an LSI-11/2 (M7270); I just tried it.
I didn't touch any of the other boards; just swapped the LSI-11/2 for a
KDF11-A (M8186), everything worked fine; put the LSI-11/2 back, dead again.

I'll try an LSI-11 (M7264) tomorrow, make sure it's the same; it and the
LSI-11/2 are similar enough that it should, but it'd be good to confirm it.


Then back to trying to work out why Mini-Unix is so fragile for me. Has
anyone else ever worked with Mini-Unix, and if so, any tips?
