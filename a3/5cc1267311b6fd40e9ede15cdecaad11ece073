Sunview was a toolkit - a really nice one in my opinion, every api had
a set of defaults and a key, so you could call sv_whatever(SV_DONE)
and did whatever with the default values.  But you could override the
defaults like so sv_whatever(SV_SOMEKEY, some_value, SV_DONE).  It
kept the system from being very verbose.

People like Sunview's api enough that there was an Xview toolkit which
was Sunview ported to X10/X11.
