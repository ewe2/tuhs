Are the UMRs allocated and set up statically?
(I haven't looked inside 2BSD for a while now, and can't remember much of
the internals anymore.)

How many UMRs does the system use? 8 for buffer cache, you might expect
one or two DH11s, that would require a few more, ethernet takes another
few, but it seems there shouldn't be such a shortage.

What did I miss?
