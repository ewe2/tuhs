I've found it weird to say the least that usenix doesn't accept troff, but
will take Word documents.

The plan 9 troff pipeline is still quite complete. A few years back Russ
Cox pointed out that new CPUs were so fast that running a statically-linked
troff pipeline to process a paper was pretty much instantaneous.

He was right and, for a few years, for tech papers, I just switched back to
troff/tbl/pic/grap and friends. It was nice.
