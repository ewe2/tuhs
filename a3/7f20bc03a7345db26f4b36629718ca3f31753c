Subject: [pups] Making disk images and Ultrix-32
In-Reply-To: <200102161720.SAA12899@unixag-kl.fh-kl.de>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10102161339570.17906-100000@triangle.cs.uofs.edu>


Two questions/observations. 

The first is only tangentially on topic, but loosely related to
my recent attempts to revive Ultrix-11.  Is there anywhere that
is, or is interested in, archiving versions of Ultrix-32 for the
VAX??  I would hate to see these become as scarce as Ultrix-11 
was.  We almost lost that one.  I have numerous TK50's of Ultrix-32
software some of which actually loads.

Which brings me to my next and much more on topic question.

How does one go about creating a .dsk image from a real device??
Is it just a dd of the raw device or is there some software needed
to make the move??  And on a further note, if I made a .dsk of the
RA81 I currently have Ultrix-11 running from, are there any of the
emulators that would be able to use this??  If so, I would be glad
to clean it up and send it to Warren for the archive.  (Assuming
I can use the Ultrix-32 system that shares these disks to make the
image.)

All the best.

Is Ultrix-32 covered by the standard license from SCO? And did DEQ
release it to the world under the same conditions as Ultrix-11?

I think I have recent Ultrix-32 on CDROM here somewhere.

Ultrix-32 isn't covered by the SCO license (well, they didn't create it),
and we haven't obtained a release from DEC/Compaq, unlike Ultrix-11. So
while hidden away in the Archive are various versions of Ultrix-32, I
cannot make them available.

Does anybody have contacts inside Compaq so we could persue a release?

Use dd in single-user mode and dump it to a tape :-) That's all.

OK, I didn't know.  I had thought that Ultrix-32 was also derived from
32V, but maybe not. I'll have to hold onto my tapes a little longer.

Hmmmm.  I wonder if anyone on comp.os.vms might know??

To a tape??  What about just dumping it to a file on another disk??

Which emulator might I be able to test this out on??  Or do I need to
find something other than an RA81 to dump??

What PDP-11 model do you have? Then I can tell you what emulators will
be suitable.

Thanks,

It's faster. There is FP11 microcode in the J11, but it's really slow from
what I gathered. The separate FP11 could be regarded more as an
accelerator.

J11 does it in microcode. When the FP11 is plugged in then it does it
faster.
