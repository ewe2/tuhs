I have just read again Clive Feather's ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14 N925
draft on sequence points, and i seem to be wrong about especially
the shown exampl,e and Random knew that earlier.  I first read
that document in the context of aliasing issues a few years back,
when i saw some BSD changesets fly by, and i remember a thread on
a FreeBSD list, too, where objects backing pointers could no
longer be accessed directly, but first need to be copied over to
some -- then newly introduced -- local scope storage before being
used, because of new aliasing rules of the C language.  It seems
i hyperventilated in the sequence point document back then.
