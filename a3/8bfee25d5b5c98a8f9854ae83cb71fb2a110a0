Subject: [TUHS] /usr/bin/bs on HPUX?
Message-ID: <75D36093-D9D0-48EF-ACAC-DF739E0236B6@mac.com>

I was poking around an HP UX system at work today, and noticed a  
command I've never noticed before ... /usr/bin/bs.

I'm sure it's been there for a long time, even though I've been an  
HPUX admin for more than a decade, sometimes I'm just blind ... but  
anyway ....

I tried to search on google ... it looks like only HPUX, AIX, and  
Maybe AU/X has it.  Seems to be some kind of pseudo BASIC like  
interpreter.

Anyone ever use it for anything?  Has anyone even noticed it before?   
I'll have to boot my Crimson to see if IRIX has it.
