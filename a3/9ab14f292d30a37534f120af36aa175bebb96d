I'm really interested in this project.

My first exposure to the -11 was in 1976. I learned assembly language  
in the second computer science course I took on an 11/20.

Since then I've been a big fan of the pdp11 and own several of the  
more recent designs. I'd be happy to help with this project but I  
don't have any free timem to devote for another week.

I have a pdp11/05 that is comparable to the 11/20 in terms of speed  
and instruction set. I need help in restoring it to operating  
condition. Sepcifically the power supplies need some transistors to be  
replaced. There are also a bunch of other things that may need help.  
Core is of unknown capacity but it's doubtful that it exceeds 24kW.  
I'd also prefer not to have to resurrect a hardcopy console which  
means converting the console interface on the CPU board to talk to a  
more modern serial device. Any constructive  :) suggestions welcome.
