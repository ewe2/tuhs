Sun’s YP was a piece of work. 

That name always sounded to me like a brand of moist pop-up baby bottom wipes. 

Baby made a poopie, and now we need a YP!

Who remember’s Jordan Hubbard’s notorious rwall incident?

He put this line into /etc/netgroup:

universal (,,)

Then he did an rwall to that group…

I on a Sun at umd at the time, and received a copy! 

It also scribbled all over Dennis Perry's Interleaf windows (the Inspector General of the ARPAnet in the Pentagon).
