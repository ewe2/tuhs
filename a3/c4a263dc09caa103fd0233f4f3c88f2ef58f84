1) Linux - not the greatest, by far, but it gets the job done and pays 
the bills ( in my case, anyway ). And it still has good long term 
viability, as of 2017, anyway.

2) Solaris - Sun finally got it right starting with Solaris 7, and it 
just got better from there.  I ran it for many, many years on my Home 
Ultra 5.
Really sad to see what Oracle did to it! I use to have boss say that 
Solaris was the UNIX geek's UNIX, he might be right ( altho these days 
that's probably BSD ).

3) Irix - Not the best UNIX, but damn, those workstations it ran on WERE 
the best.  I miss my Indigo R4K/Elan almost as much as I do my Ultra 5 
with Solaris 9 on it!
