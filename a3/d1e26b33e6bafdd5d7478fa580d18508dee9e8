I don't know of any, but I do know there are some very early
versions of the C compiler dating back to around 1972 that you
can find source for and actually run.  They're quite a bit different
from modern C.  (Even the C present in 6th ed unix feels
a bit odd to a modern C programmer like myself, 7th ed starts
feeling more "normal").
