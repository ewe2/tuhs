Well, we want to be able to manage 100G or more of encrypted traffic sanely.

We currently get this by lots (well 20) of not-so-wimpy cores to do all the
work since none of the offload solutions can scale.

The problem is that there's no systems with lots (100's) of wimpy cores
that we can do the offload with that also have enough bandwidth to keep up.
And even if there were, things like NUMA and slow interprocessor connects
make the usefulness of the boatloads of cores a lot trickier to utilize
than it should....

Then again, a lot of what we do is rather special case, even if we do use
off the shelf technology to get there...
