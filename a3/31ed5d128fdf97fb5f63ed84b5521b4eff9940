Thank you so much for the explanation.  I was aware that in old C 
structures a->b references were interpreted as *(a + b), but didn't know 
that early C was so close to B that it could run most B programs by just 
adding some declarations.  It seems a logical evolutionary and 
bootstrapping step.

What I'm trying to do is study the dependencies between the kernel's 
files.  Maybe a good approximation would be to consider all functions as 
global and ignore variables.
