Kids these days ....  :-)

Although, I bet if you had called it a regular expression - they might have
understood.   My SW professional daughter learned about regular expressions
in the CS theory course a couple of years ago.   It was an "ah ha moment"
for her.   I had tried to teach her 'globing' years early (unsuccessfully
at the time).  But she remembered enough of the lesson it turns out.
