According to Eric Raymond in Chapter 15. Tools: make: Automating Your
Recipes", *The Art of Unix Programming*

*Why the tab in column 1? Yacc <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc> was
new, Lex <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_(software)> was brand new. I
hadn't tried either, so I figured this would be a good excuse to learn.
After getting myself snarled up with my first stab at Lex, I just did
something simple with the pattern newline-tab. It worked, it stayed. And
then a few weeks later I had a user population of about a dozen, most of
them friends, and I didn't want to screw up my embedded base. The rest,
sadly, is history.*
