ANSI escape sequences aka ISO 6429 came via ECMA-48 i have
learned, and that appeared first in 1976 (that via Wikidpedia).
I made a survey about twenty years ago over terminfo (source)
entries, and found it not worth the effort to care for anything
else, and not to padding, too.  (My experience with hardware does
not even cause a little cough in this audience, however.)
