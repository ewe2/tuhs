​I am very interested in your work exactly for the reasons you explain in
your email message. The only difference is that my PDP-11 is one 23/PLUS.
There are some differences between this one and the PDP-11/23 and perhaps
your emulator woudln't work in this PDP-11 model.

I will test the working state of my PDP. If all is fine perhaps I could
help doing with some tests on it.​
