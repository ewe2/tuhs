I try to avoid inserting non-Unix IBM stuff into TUHS, but since Clem 
opened the door, ...

When I was at Yorktown 1975-77 and 1979-82, using Script (IBM's runoff) 
on VM/370 was very pleasant from my perspective, for papers, manuals and 
my three performance modeling books. IIRC when I got there Script output 
went to Versatecs for draft output and to APS5 for camera ready. By 
1979, DCF superseded Script and 6670s superseded Versatecs for draft 
output. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCRIPT_(markup) and 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Generalized_Markup_Language seem fair 
to me.

While I'm inserting non-Unix stuff, and presuming some parallel between 
Yorktown and Murray Hill, the culture discussions make me point out that 
I intentionally avoided ties and suits my first couple of years, wearing 
a turtleneck for my initial interviews. Then my wife insisted I start 
wearing three piece wool suits, which were fine in the cold months 
requiring driving, but I avoided them when the weather was warm enough 
for me to cycle the five miles to the lab 
(https://technologists.com/songs/swans.html).
