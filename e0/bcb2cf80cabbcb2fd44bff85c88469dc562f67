Bill Cunningham:

    I am copying all I can from the unix archive and will burn it to cd
  because I know how precious they are. But what I was thinking was v5,6,7 for
  example. Take them and add USB support. Linux would be a good example from
  which to draw from. Because it's Posix. Much more could be adde to /dev.

Has anyone ever made a UNIBUS or Qbus USB card?
