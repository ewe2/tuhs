In that sense, job control and process groups *are* independent of
the terminal device.

The complication arises when you have to multiplex one terminal
between several different jobs in an interactive shell. Setting
the terminal process group correctly -- the only way to accomplish
that -- is fragile and the consequences of setting it to the wrong
value are inconvenient, to say the least.
