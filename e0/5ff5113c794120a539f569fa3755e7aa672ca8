Interesting.  I've taken a look at the sources from the CD set and
found that the text there (in /usr/src/sys/sys/machdep.c) is the same
as above.  Looking further, the entire directory has the same files in
4.0 and 4.1, with the same modification dates.  So it looks as the 4.0
sources accidentally got replaced by the 4.1 sources.
