Subject: [TUHS] Happy birthday, Grace Hopper and J.F.Ossana!
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.21.1712100958300.35694@aneurin.horsfall.org>

As promised :-)

Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace (and daughter of Lord Byron), 
was born on this day in 1815; arguably the world's first computer 
programmer and a highly independent woman, she saw the potential in 
Charles Babbage's new-fangled invention.

J.F.Ossanna was given unto us on this day in 1928; a prolific programmer, 
he not only had a hand in developing Unix but also gave us the ROFF 
series.

Who'ld've thought that two computer greats would share the same birthday?
