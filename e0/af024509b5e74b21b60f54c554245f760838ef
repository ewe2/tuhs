As others have said already, disk (or better, filesystem) quotas have
been used widely in any environment with more than a few users. I
remember a 5MB quota at uni when I was an undergrad, and I definitely
remember when it was increased to 10MB :)

Filesystem quotas are currently used extensively in large computing
facilities (clusters and distributed computing systems of different
sort), and in virtually all pubnix systems (we have been using it for
"medialab" at freaknet for more than 20 years now...).

Over the years I have learnt that if unix has something that I think
is useless, then almost surely I have not bumped into the use case,
and the use case is normally important enough to explain why that
feature was made part of unix ;)
