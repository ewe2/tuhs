Subject: [TUHS] History of strncpy
Message-ID: <CAGg_6+MMAB9pqrMkiD7kd8gGyRYdSDeV9AZ7zaAOC9etO=GP1Q@mail.gmail.com>

On another list I am on, a discussion about the history and purpose of
strncpy has arisen.  The only reference I have found to it is <
http://lwn.net/Articles/507432/>:

The original reason for strncpy() was when directory names were limited to
14 chars. The other two bytes contained the inode number. For that
particular case, strncpy() worked quite well.

Is that really the reason it came into being?

Just a bit curious,
