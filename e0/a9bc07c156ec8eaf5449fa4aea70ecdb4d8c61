We we taught Algol 68 R, running it on an ICL 1904S from 1st year =
onwards.  The 1904 was a 24bit 6 bits per =E2=80=9Cbyte=E2=80=9D system. =
 Handling upper and lower on the line printer was a lot of work!

The mixture of language practical and theory helped cement both.  Unix =
did not come along - for the uni - until a year or so later.
A decent understanding of the Algol68 pointers, deref (auto or not), =
casts, array slices, garbage collection etc made moving to C fairly easy =
for most of the cohort. =20


The fortune cooked has been a bad journalist and taken the sentence out =
of context.  The previous 423 pages were essential reading.=
