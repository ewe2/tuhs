I have an old copy of CADroid for the Sun-3 from 1987 sitting around, which runs on SunView. (It’s the original version before I worked with Mitch Bradley integrating it with CForth to replace its old icky extension language. Unfortunately I didn’t keep a copy of the source code and our CForth mods.)

Sun licensed it from Lucasfilm, and used it to design various circuit board. That tar file includes a 4 meg board schematic (but not the rest of Sun’s schematics library, alas ;).
