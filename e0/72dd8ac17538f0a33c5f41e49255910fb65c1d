Ahh...  I remember the CCI Power series very well.  IIRC, there was the 
5/32 (a pissy little box, until the 5/32X came along, which actually did 
the Right Thing (tm) when it implemented instruction restart correctly 
upon a SEGV) and the 6/32 (we had the 8MHz board, whereas most users had 
the 5MHz board; "we got cycles to burn!").

Those were the days, when geeks did their best but were over-ruled by the 
marketoids; oh, the stories I could tell about my STC days (known by the 
geeks as "Strangled Tangled and Confused), but I'm unsure about the 
Statute of Limitations...
