I*'m not sure what you mean by CB3, but these features (shared memory, 
semaphores, IPC) were added to CB-UNIX (Bell Labs, Columbus) precisely 
because they were needed in real time telco systems and not preset in 
the versions from New Jersey.  This would have been in the early 1980s.  
When I got there in 1981 I think CB-UNIX was already well established 
and had these features.  (These would show up, ironically, in /usr/ucb, 
which did not stand for Berkeley.)
