Subject: [TUHS] Apple Darwin 0.1 and 0.3 sort of running on x86!

I don't know if this is of any interest to anyone here, but 1999 is 18 years
ago, so maybe it counts as old?

Over on nextcomputers.org various users had found a backup of next68k.org
which included a wget of the old source

http://nextftp.onionmixer.net/next.68k.org/otto/html/pub/Darwin/PublicSource
/Darwin/index.html

So I found a copy of Rhapsody DR-2, the last binary version of this Mach
2.5+4.4BSD and after a day got a kernel to build.  Another day and I had it
interfacing to the driverkit to load drivers.

After a post on reddit someone gave me a link to some kdx p2p network, where
they had a Darwin 0.3 toast image.

using what I learned with Darwin 0.1 I got the 0.3 to build as well.

I uploaded a bunch of stuff here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/aapl-darwin/

although it seems to not let me upload the toast images themselves.

I did slam together a minimal Darwin 0.3 qemu image that can sort-of boot to
single user mode.  It's not even slightly useful, but it does show that it
works.
