When I first wrote C code I *assumed* things that were only necessarily 
true on the platform I learned on (char=8, short=16, long=32; int=16, 
pointer could be either 16 or 32, requiring the addition of the keywords 
"near" and "far").

(I'm glad C99 introduced <stdint.h>, but on that platform the only C99 
compiler is OpenWatcom.)

-uso.
