Ok, so maybe this is no longer very interesting subject, but I
recalled there was once a language named SNOBOL.

Wikipedia says, sed was written around 1974 [1] and about SNOBOL it
says, the language was being taught [2] in the late 1960s and early 1970s
in universities, so I guess it was quite popular. I wonder if it was
ported to Unix early enough to help before sed became available?
Anyway, I have got Phil Budne's implementation [3] and after usual
drill (configure, make, make install, stow) I could do this:

$  snobol4 -b -L ./numlines02.sno < numlines02.sno 
1       lnum = 0
2 loop  lnum = lnum + 1
3       output = lnum " " input :s(loop)
4 end

The first version did not work so well:

$  snobol4 -b -L ./numlines01.sno < numlines01.sno | head -8
1           lnum = 0
2 LOOP      line = INPUT
3 * Here: detect EOF (how?) and jump to : END
4           lnum  = lnum + 1
5           OUTPUT = lnum " " line : S(LOOP)
6 END
7 END
8 END

As I already have understood, even after reaching end of input, the
INPUT statement keeps returning last line read, counter keeps
increasing and last line is being written out for infinity. I have not
read any serious docs on SNOBOL yet, so I have no idea how to make the
'01' version work, but this is of rather small importance to the list.

However, since [2] claims SNOBOL was written in Bell Labs, just like
AWK and sed, so perhaps they could be using SNOBOL?
