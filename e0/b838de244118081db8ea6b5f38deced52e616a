The group that created PWB may well have started before the MERT group, at
least from what I can find documented in early papers... However, the first
release we have of PWB is labeled 1.0 and it is 1977. The ACM MERT papers
are from 1975.

I believe that they did track releases. And this may be a case of rolling
release. I'm told, but can't find a good reference for it, that editions
were just a manual thing and that there wasn't a 'master tape' made of each
edition until late in the process (like maybe as late as the 7th edition
since I see references to different versions of the 6th edition, though
that may be nothing more than the '50 patches' tape). This makes some of
the traffic difficult. The Network Unix folks started with 5th editionish
release, but had frequent updates during their work as the 6th edition was
being prepped and then settled on the 6th edition to release their work
(since the tapes we have of it are of a lightly-modified 6th edition (at
least relative to dennis_v6). I'm also unsure of when the first "release"
of MERT was, which may be critical to answering that question...
