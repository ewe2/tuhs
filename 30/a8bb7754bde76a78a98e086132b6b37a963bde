	Not really.  Newer systems mount the root filesystem read-only
	while running fsck.   After the filesystem is verified as clean
	then it is upgraded to read-write.

	Older systems such as 2BSD can't run with a read-only root 
	filesystem that I know of.   At least not easily/happily.   Might be 
	possible (the ability to upgrade a ro mount to rw is present) but
	it's never been a priority to look into it ;)

	Cheers,
