Hopkins had a KSR37 in a small office (or perhaps closet) on the second =
floor.   It was also fitted with a modem I built (a Pennywhistle, an =
absolutely abhorrant design).
It had the greek box and we used it for many a nroff term paper or the =
like.    It was also our way of getting on the Arpanet.    The =
university had a =E2=80=9Ctie line=E2=80=9D that let us call the DC =
metro area so we could get into the Pentagon TIP.    However, Mike Muuss =
also convinced the operator once to place a collect call.    =E2=80=9CIt=E2=

the boldest operator hacks until Brian Redman and Peter Langston were =

After I graduated from JHU, I found an ASR 37 in a surplus sale.    I =
had it for years in my apartment kitchen.   Not only did it handle all =
the nroff ESC-8/ESC-9 stuff and the like without need for an output =
filter, it had a giant NEWLINE key on the right side and was perhaps the =
only terminal I ever used that didn=E2=80=99t need the unix NL->CRLF =
mapping turned on.     Amusingly, the thing sat there idle until DSR =
came up on the modem and then its motors would start.    When CD came on =
a bright green PROCEED light illuminated on the front of it.    I used =
it for years until modems got up to the 9600 baud range and decided a =
CRT would be nicer than the printing terminal.

I gave mine to RS who I think used it to block in someone=E2=80=99s car =
