Doug, Larry et al,

Thanks very much for the history - unaware of those stories/ facts.
I=E2=80=99ve scanned the 1989 Miller et al paper, will read properly =
soon.
The legacy of that paper is the extensive automatic testing now =
commonplace in large Open Software projects.

I wasn't clear in what I wrote. Have been immersed in early papers of =
teaching the kernel at UNSW :(
Reminds on this list precise terms matter: that =E2=80=9CUnix=E2=80=9D / =
UNIX (tm) and "the kernel" (+ version) are very different.

I meant the V5 / V6 kernel was =E2=80=98known defect free', hadn=E2=80=99t=
 thought of Userland / utilities & libraries :(
=46rom what I=E2=80=99ve read: distribution tapes, pre-USG, were created =
from the current copy of =E2=80=99the system=E2=80=99 - not sure which =
machine that was, presumably one controlled by Ken.

Is that a reasonable statement, the kernel, pre-USG, had zero (known) =
Technical Debt when shipped?

I=E2=80=99ve read that Ken wrote the kernel with an eye to it being a =
coding exemplar.
Deliberately wrote consistent, high quality code.

Is that another mis-interpretation of mine?

regards
steve j
