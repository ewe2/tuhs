Real as in 286 or as in 8088 :-).  I've love to have a v7 port to my
DEC Rainbow 100, which isn't too IBM-PC-like other than the fact that
both have an 8088.  There was a 8088 port of V7 (or maybe it was v6)
to the Rainbow marketed under the name of venix, but no one seems to
be able to find a distribution anymore.

gcc can compile K&R, but the language has evolved some since the v7
days.  =*, =+, etc became *=, +=, etc.  There are some other subtle
things too that I don't recall off the top of my head, but which vexed
the comp.lang.c news groups in the early 1980's.
