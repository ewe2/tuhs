That might be fun to program in assembler but I suspect the
performance would suck.  The ISA complexity implies a microcoded
implementation (with all the associated overheads).  And compilers
generally have difficulty taking advantage of complex ISAs.

Agreed.

Likewise.  Warts upon warts...  It's an abomination.

I disagree on the Alpha.  Apart from the idiotic decision to combine
imprecise exceptions with needing software support for IEEE FP, I
thought it was a very clean and well designed architecture.  It wasn't
fun to program in directly but it was intended for use with compiled
languages.  The designers went to a fair amount of effort to avoid
embedding bottlenecks in the language.

For anyone who's into really CISC architectures, check out the iAPX432.
