I agree even though it is self serving.  I'm the guy that posted something
on soc.singles and disappeared off usenet for three months (was installing
Unix on a supercomputer at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, no UUCP,
no Usenet).

I came back and people were *still* arguing about what I said.  Huh.

I don't really care for me at this point, but I'd love for my kids
to learn about me through all those posts.  soc.singles was a 
distraction, comp.arch, comp.unix-wizards, there is a pretty big
window into who I am in those posts.  I've been reading 30-35 year
old posts I made, and while I'm ashamed of how cocky I was, there
was some substance there.  

So I'd love an interface like dejanews had.  You could limit to a
set of groups (I don't remember how you did that but it was a thing)
and you could limit it over a date range, and of course you could
search by string.  I think there was more ways to tailor the search.

If I can offer up some help getting this back, let me know.
