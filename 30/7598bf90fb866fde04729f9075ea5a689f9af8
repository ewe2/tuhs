I've seen lots of sco stuff say it's SYSV... like Xenix 2.3.4 ... So I
guess it's not outside of that realm.  It's too bad SCO never did
bundle the dev kit & networking or that Linux thing probably never
would have gained commercial traction.. but then that's just my wild
guess.

Morbid curiosity I guess... seeing as it's basically all but dead.  I
guess the SYSV stuff we ran on the 3B2's was more modern, and 'usable'
just as SYSVr3 (AIX) certainly was/is.

That and it's been cool slowly getting SYSIII to go so in a way I
wanted to line up the last Bell UNIX, SYSV to be able to run it on
SIMH...  It certainly wouldn't be for anything 'production' grade, but
I guess it was this, or spend more time with 386BSD on Bochs......

Anyways I just got my first callback from Novell, and they are
forwarding it to the "linux team" for clarification on what on earth
SYSV even is...
