I just discovered that Wikipedia has a nice article "teleprinter" that  
goes into detail about these devices.

About "HERE IS" they state this:
Some teleprinters had a "Here is" key, which transmitted a fixed  
sequence 20 or 22 characters, programmable by breaking tabs off a  
drum. This sequence could also be transmitted automatically upon  
receipt of an ENQ (control E) signal, if enabled.[19][20] This was  
commonly used to identify a station; the operator could press the key  
to send the station identifier to the other end, or the remote station  
could trigger its transmission by sending the ENQ character,  
essentially asking "who are you?".
