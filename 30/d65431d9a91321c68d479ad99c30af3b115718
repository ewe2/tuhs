Of course nothing will please everybody. xD

With Alpine at least I think if it's set to reply-to the list address by 
default, then it'll just ask me when I hit reply, whether I want to use 
the reply-to address or not, so I can have it both ways.  Dunno about more 
"civilized" mail clients though - I've barely ever used anything that 
wasn't Pine. ;)

-uso.
