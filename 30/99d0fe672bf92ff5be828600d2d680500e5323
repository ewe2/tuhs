It's true that CR takes longer, but you have to send both CR and LF because
CR only returns the carriage whereas LF only feeds lines.  Skipping to the
bottom of a page was done by sending pure LFs, whereas underlining was
achieved (though the 33 had backarrow rather than underscore) by sending
a line of text followed by CR followed by a line of spaces and underscores.
Later, when it was observed that this made the text illegible on glass TTYs,
the order was reversed: spaces and underscores, then CR, then text.

It may have been the Olivetti.

Consider the matter of Analytic Philosophy.  Dennett and Bennett are well-known.
Dennett rarely or never cites Bennett, so Bennett rarely or never cites Dennett.
There is also one Dummett.  By their works shall ye know them.  However, just as
no trinities have fourth persons (Zeppo Marx notwithstanding), Bummett is hardly
known by his works.  Indeed, Bummett does not exist.  It is part of the function
of this and other e-mail messages, therefore, to do what they can to create him.
