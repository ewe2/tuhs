Oops; upon re-reading my article, we had a sprinkling of /34s, with just
the one /23.  I think.

I'd like to believe that I was the first in Australia to port V6 to the 
/34, the /23, and the /60 (I did a paper on that as well), but if others 
in the rest of the world beat me to it then I never heard about it.
