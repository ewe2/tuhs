I tend to prefer to keep everything to 77-79 when I'm actually formatting 
code for releases as opposed to "just don't care".

I tend to feel that C strikes a perfect balance between minimalist and 
powerful.

Same.

I mean, I've started to pick up 8086 assembler, but I can write C, I can 
code for my Apple //e, or I can code for my AMD64 boxen, or for my old 
PS/2, or theoretically for my ancient Macintoshes...or a number of other 
systems.  It's not quite "write once run everywhere", but it's pretty 
close.

-uso.
