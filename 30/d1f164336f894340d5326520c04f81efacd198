Interesting.  and authentic! :-)  I am too lazy and used apout with
a v7 tree.  I used this script:

#!/bin/sh
export APOUT_ROOT=/backup/raid2/pdp11/v7
H=`pwd`
R=./rebuilt
W="$R/u0.s $R/u1.s $R/u2.s $R/u3.s $R/u4.s $R/u5.s $R/u6.s $R/u7.s $R/u8.s $R/u9.s"
apout /backup/raid2/pdp11/v7/bin/as ./sys1.s $W $R/ux.s


Which seems to work pretty well.

yes, sorry.  I think just committed fixed for all of them.

Yes, that's exactly what it did.  Took me a bit to figure that out since
they look very similar.

I also did a bunch of clean up of existing pages (probably should wait for
someone to review them but what the heck).  Mostly simple ocr errors.

I'm not sure we need to define the system traps; some (like mkdir) collide.
I turned off the def for now.

Also, some of the registers for math (mq, ac) don't seem to be defined
by the v7 as.  Not sure how that works to be honest (fp & mult are
beyond my pdp-11 knowledge).

It's closer now.  Still some editing to be done and some missing pages,
but closer.
