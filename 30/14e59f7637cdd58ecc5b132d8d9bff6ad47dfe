BTW, Bob Morris was not a Senior, and had no middle name.  It is my =
understanding that he inserted an =E2=80=9Ch=E2=80=9D when a middle =
initial was demanded at the Labs, hence =E2=80=9Crhm=E2=80=9D.

His son is Robert Tappan Morris, Labs login and general tag =E2=80=9Crtm,"=
 is not a junior.

(I had to fight spelling correction on this Mac so much for this post =
that I have turned it off.)
