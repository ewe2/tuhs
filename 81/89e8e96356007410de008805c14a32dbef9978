I think there was a help at one point but it got lost.  PWB maybe?
There is still apropos which can be useful.

What helped me starting out was one of those trifold summaries of
common commands.

ls for directory listings?  Very poor choice for newbies but pleasant
once you know it is there.  Short is nice for common stuff.

I just remember a steep learning curve initially.  But you got over
it pretty quickly and then things were pleasant.  I found the Unix
docs to be great but hard to figure where things were at first. 
Once you were past that, smooth sailing.
