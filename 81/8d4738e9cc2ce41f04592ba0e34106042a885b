This is cool stuff. Just a few weeks after thinking "this would be
cool if we could rebuild a working early Unix from the printed source
code" you've done just that. While it seems pretty primitive, it's
certainly recognizable as a Unix already and LIGHTYEARS ahead of
anything else I've played with from that era (DOS-11 and RT-11)
