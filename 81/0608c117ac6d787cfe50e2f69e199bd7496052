It was the old suntools lock program, which was nothing more than a full size window that covered up the screen.     You could use the hotkeys to iconify it but you had a fraction of a second before it replaced itself.     However, if you were fast you could as you kept iconifying it find a terminal  window, do a ps, and kill the screen saver.    You’d get like 2 characters typed on each iteration.

That was the time I scared all my old BRL buddies because the account they gave me was ron at hq.af.mil <mailto:ron at hq.af.mil>.      I don’t recall the root password that time, but the password on the cisco routers we were working on was “DickCheney” (this was back when he was secy of defense).
