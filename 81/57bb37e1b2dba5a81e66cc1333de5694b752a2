I promise I'll stop replying now, just one more...

After unpacking the 5th Edition source, there are lots of applications
still written in assembly code; I'll provide a list below. And many
of them still use the jsr    r5, calling convention.

5th Edition UNIX has two a.out header types: the 0407 a.out header still
allowed mixed code+data with writable code. The 0410 a.out header was the
first where code was read-only, and data was separated out. Looking at the
paper manuals I've got, 4th Edition is the first manual which mentions the
0410 header.

I would guess that the 0410 read-only code header was created when
PDP-11s arrived which supported split instruction/data address spaces.

And here are the .s files from 5th Edition:
