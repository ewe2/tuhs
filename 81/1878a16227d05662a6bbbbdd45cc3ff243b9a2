i like to use it natively as much as possible, especially the 9front
edition with its usability (e.g. mouse chording) improvements. if that is
not possible, i drawterm into some cpu or a local vm where i can get a
little environment to work with whatever is at /mnt/term.

it also has a powerful command language and structural regular expressions,
and you can use your favorite unix tools on any piece of text you please.

it has given me the best text editing and programming experience i've ever
had.
