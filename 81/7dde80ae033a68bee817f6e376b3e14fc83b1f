Subject: [pups] Bringing up the fist C compiler

About a thousand years ago, I recall hand-building programs for 8-bit microprocessors (in what we'd call embedded systems today).  In many cases, I was the "assembler", writing directly in machine code which was then either keyed in through front-panel switches or burned into a PROM....  -- Ian

	Ah. Ok, now I understand what you're asking for.
	You want to know what the first C was written in, and what that
	compiler/assembler was written in/on, and so on...
	
	No, I'm just deducting. Since the reference posted said that TMG was the
	first higher level language implemented, it follows that it must have been
	written in a low level language, namely assembler.
	
	Admittedly, the PDP-7 TMG *could* have been written in some high level
	language on some other machine using some tool that made a PDP-7
	executable, so your guess is as good as mine.
	
	But even though I cannot account for all steps, I can guarantee that at
	the end of the chain, you *will* find assembler.
	
	I guess my MACRO-11 implementation of C isn't good enough. :-)
	(Well, it ain't mine, it's the normal DECUS C, but I'm hacked some at it.)
