Isn't that just an accident of history, though? The GNU stuff was
far enough along when Linux got going that he could crib most of
it by default to build a "complete" working system; he was just
providing the kernel, whereas Unix traditionally had been distributed
as a complete system, so the BSDs just kind of followed that model.

Sounds very familiar. I'll wager that just about any large organization
with a heavy investment in Linux has a similar problem on their hands.
I've _heard_ that Meta is different, but have no first-hand knowledge.

Was CSRG doing research, or producing a production system? It sure
seems like they were trying to thread a needle there that put them into
a weird position.

But more generally, it feels like this doesn't take into account the context
of the times.  $n$ manufacturers back in the minicomputer days were
used to writing their own OS for each new machine; sure they adapted
Unix, but the idea that they'd treat it differently from that standpoint
feels like something that didn't really occur to anyone until the late 80s.
By then, the stage was set for the arrival of something like Linux.

This I can totally buy, but my perception (as very much an outsider) was
that people ran --- and continue to run --- Linux because, simply, they
want to run Linux. They choose Not to run a BSD or illumos or whatever
else because they want to run Linux instead.

There was a time in the early 90s when FreeBSD was objectively better
in almost all metrics than Linux, including faster networking.  But people
still wanted to run Linux instead. Why? It just captured the zeitgeist better;
the barrier to entry was lower, you didn't have to put up with the "old school
Unix" mentality of many of the players (my term for what you have referred
to as, "the Gods of BSD" and some of the big egos of the USENIX crowd),
and people got religious about the license.

Many of the explanations we throw around here are interesting, but too
often feel like justifications after the fact. So much of it was simply
preference.
