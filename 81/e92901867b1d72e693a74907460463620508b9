That's still only 7 chars!

It is this spellingThingsOutInExcruciatingDetail that I find
hard to read. Whether you use 80 columns or 800.  Why not
think a bit harder and come up with shorter name?  Fix that
and you don't need wide columns.

Not to mention longer words are easier to misspell (which then
brings in an all singling all dancing IDE...)

Shorter lines are just faster to read. Which is why (printed)
newspapers have multiple columns.

Funny. To adjust column width in acme I use monospace font 
and a file called "ruler" (reproduced below):

          1         2         3         4         5         6         7
