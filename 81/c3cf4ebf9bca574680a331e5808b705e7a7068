This was also an issue at UC Berkeley, but with Microsoft Windows.
I was working in the Postgres group which Microsoft was very
generously supporting with software. There were discussions about
getting a Windows source license but the CS department didn't

I remember the first time I saw Linux. Ironically it was on the
desktop machine of a guy who was in the BSD developers office.
