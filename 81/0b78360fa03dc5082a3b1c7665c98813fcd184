	That'll do it too ;)

	It is tight on space but I can get a complete 2.11 system (with sources)
	and a small swap partition on a 96MB Zip disk.   Not suitable really
	for going multi-user but as a single user mode system for fixing
	up /etc/init or building a kernel it's nice.

	Might not look too weird - different of course, who knows but what
	you might like the new look ;)

	Hmmm, those buttons/cabling are for RD/MSCP devices - not sure if it's
	possible to use them with SCSI devices.
