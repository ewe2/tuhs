Agreed.  Plus, it’s unmistakable that rm meant “remove” when you examine her sister “rmdir.”

I think it’s a bit more interesting to uncover why rm does not remove directories by default thereby obviating the need for rmdir—-especially since the potentially nightmarish  incantation of “rm -rf” does include files, folders and just about everything else in between.

Another country heard from.<http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue49/fischer.html> I doubt the Robert Morris story, given that a command as fundamental as "rm" must have come about very early in the development, and there isn't a pattern of naming commands after their authors.

I was curious if there's any truth to it.  I found
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl and was poking around but
couldn't determine when the rm command came about.

Thoughts?
