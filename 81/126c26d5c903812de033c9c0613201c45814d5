To update this thread:

The wording from my last edit to the Wikipedia article on cron is still
there, although one of the references has been removed, and the phrase
"better source needed" has been added. That part is OK with me, and I
actually agree with it--a better source *is* needed.

But at least the article at this point no longer says that cron is an
acronym.

[To Greg Lehey: As anyone can edit the article, you could could add a
paragraph about bogus claims as to what cron means if you want, but, in my
opinion, the article is better without this distracting discussion.]
