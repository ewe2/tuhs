[I sent this almost a week ago, but it never showed up, probably because
my From address didn't match my subscription address.  Apologies if this
is a dup.]

I confirm Jon's observation.  It's true, sendmail wasn't "designed" in
the waterfall model sense, because at the time the email world was a
disaster, with new networks appearing seemingly daily, each of which
seemed to feel a need to come up with a new syntax for addresses.  Some
of those syntaxes were left-associative and some right-associative, and
there was no "correct" answer --- different sites wanted to parse the
same email address differently.  For example, consider:

	decvax!research!foo@berkeley

If you're on decvax you should send this to research.  If you're at
Berkeley you should send this to decvax.  And if you're on some other
site with an ARPAnet connection but without UUCP, you should send it to
Berkeley.  I concluded that something arbitrarily flexible (which meant
Turing Complete) was necessary.  Also, since some sites didn't
understand things like "@" signs in addresses, it was necessary to
rewrite the header so "reply" would work.  And all of this had to fit
into a 16-bit address space.

Life is easier today: the world has agreed on "user@domain", the
multitude of networks (e.g., UUCP, DECnet, CSNet, Berknet, ChaosNet,
PurdueNet, and possibly my favorite, a network out of the UK that used
"user@domain" but with the domain reversed, e.g., eric@edu.berkeley.cs
instead of eric@cs.berkeley.edu) is down to effectively one, and the
only 16-bit machines out there are not-very-powerful microcontrollers.
If I were building sendmail in this very different world, it would look
very different.
