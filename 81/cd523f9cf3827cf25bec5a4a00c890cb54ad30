In the "good old days" of Unix, the community succeeded because we all 
shared and treated each other with respect.  Each listened to the 
other.  Sure, there were disagreements about technical issues, as well 
there should have been, but they were rarely made personal. That's what 
made that community great.  I liked those times, and loved the people in 
them.   What happened to lose those aspects?   I don't think I want to 
be part of the new community where egos seem to run rampant...
