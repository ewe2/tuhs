Yah, that makes sense.  I guess this means that the system we
rebuild won't be capable of building itself unless we somehow
find an old as or srcs.

The approach I'm taking currently is to use the 1972_stuff "as" (v2)
using apout and some sed magic so that the original sources are
undisturbed.  The code is in the svn as tools/assem.
