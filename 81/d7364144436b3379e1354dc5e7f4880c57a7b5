FYI.  UNESCO call for a study on the future institutional structure for 
Software Heritage.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Dear all,
     I do hope you are all safe, and could take some time off to recharge the 
batteries that these hectic times have drained quite a bit.

Some of you know already Software Heritage (https://www.softwareheritage.org): 
it is a nonprofit initiative, started by Inria and supported by UNESCO, whose 
mission is to ensure that software source code, as part of the common heritage 
of humankind, is preserved over time and made available to all, building, 
maintaining and developing a universal source code archive, providing 
persistent identifiers for all software artifacts, and creating the largest 
shared knowledge base about software artifacts ever built.

This is a long term undertaking, and UNESCO has just published a call for 
advice, via a small feasibility study providing options for establishing the 
future independent, non profit, multi-stakeholder organization that will host 
Software Heritage for the long run.

As Software Heritage is a shared infrastructure that will support use cases of 
interest to the members of this list, I take the liberty to bring this call to 
your attention, and I'd be very grateful if you could also forward it to 
whomever you believe could be interested in answering.

Detailed information on the expected advice and procedures to answer the call 
is online at: 
https://careers.unesco.org/job/Paris-Consultant-on-Software-Heritage-CIMID/519826502/

The deadline for the answer is September 26th.

Thank you for your help

Roberto Di Cosmo (roberto@dicosmo.org)
