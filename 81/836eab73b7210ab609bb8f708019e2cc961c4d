Are you sure it was called "bin"? The PDP-7 team are working on the
assumption that it was called "system" because init links the shell
from "system" into a user's home directory:

   sys setuid		" Set the user's user-id,
   sys chdir; dd	" change into the "dd" directory
   sys chdir; dir	" and then into the user's directory
   ...
   sys link; system; sh; sh	" Link sh in system dir to this dir
system:
   ...
   <sy>;<st>;<em>; 040040

There's no mention of the directory's name in the kernel, but i-node 3
has to contain init (we assume "system" again) and i-node 4 is the
directory that holds users' home directories ("dd").
