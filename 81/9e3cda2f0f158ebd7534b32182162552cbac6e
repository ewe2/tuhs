As an undergrad in the early 1980s, posters made from line printer 
strips were popular.  Character overstrikes were used as pixels and 
could be discerned as photos from a few feet away.  These filled a wall 
in our student office / study area.  Given the times & 100% male 
occupancy, let's just say the posters wouldn't fly today...  Each poster 
was multiple strips wide.  Does such a program ring a bell?  Ascii art 
was popular, but I don't recall details on making them.
