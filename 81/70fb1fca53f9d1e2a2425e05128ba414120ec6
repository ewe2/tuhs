386BSD died because its founder couldn't deal with collaboration. He tried
to
be dictator and that failed because he didn't accept other people's
collaboration
out of worries he couldn't sell 386BSD. NetBSD and FreeBSD took up the
charge
for a free and open system. I'll agree it was unfortunate that there was a
split
since NetBSD focused on portability and FreeBSD focused on fastest possible
i386/i486 code. I'd suggest, though, that the USL lawsuit cast a huge pall
on
things and introduced enough uncertainty to further derail things. Had it
not
been for that additional blow, things would have turned out differently.

OpenBSD and Dragonfly BSD didn't split until years later and also
represented differences of opinion on where to take the focus of the
system (OpenBSD thought the NetBSD folks didn't take security seriously
enough and the DFBSD folks thought the efforts to make a parallel kernel
in FreeBSD were off track and should be done completely differently).

We wound up with MACH in BSD because when Sun tried to donate their
VM code to Berkeley, the corporate lawyers said no. It was giving away too
much shareholder value, and would result in a huge write-off which would,
one would presume, negatively affect the stock price. Had this donation
actually transpired, 386BSD would have had a bigger advantage from the
get go... Oh well
