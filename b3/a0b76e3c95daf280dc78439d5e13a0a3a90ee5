Excellent!

Shorting any set of DL11-W pins together still shouldn't have caused that
symptom, AFAICS.

I'm too lazy to pull out a DL11-W, and prints thereof, to check, but I suspect
that what actually happened is that trace carries some 'interesting' signal,
and it got grounded 'or something' by the exposed ends of the flat cable.

Indeed! I was worried about that...
