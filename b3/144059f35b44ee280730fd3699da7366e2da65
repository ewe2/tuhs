I was reading comments on an article about this today, and someone 
raised the idea that Windows is dead, and Microsoft will just switch to 
Linux.

Can you imagine a world where one operating system dominates the playing 
field, both server and client? And while some would say "well, UNIX won" 
- I don't consider Linux to be "UNIX" just as many here do not.

They have SQL Server for Linux now, and they have a Linux subsystem for 
Windows that allows you to run Linux binaries on Windows. I'd love to 
see some benchmarks of SQL Server on Linux vs. Windows.

How long before they take the Windows GUI and video drivers and slap it 
on top of Linux for a test spin? (if they haven't already)

I wonder how Dave Cutler would feel about that? :)
