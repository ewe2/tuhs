I have several generations of these too.  I also have several crates of
9-track tapes, QIC-24 tapes, QIC-150 tapes, and various generations of
DDS DAT tapes.  I don't think that I have anything worth keeping on these
as I've transfered worthwhile stuff to newer media over time.  Hard to
believe that the entire contents of a 9-track tape fit in a negligible
amount of memory these days.

The thing that's kept me from getting these out of my basement is that
I'd prefer to erase them first, just in case.  Does anybody have experience
with a decent bulk tape eraser?

Jon
