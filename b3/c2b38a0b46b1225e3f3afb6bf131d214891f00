The proper escape sequence to end underline is technically \e[24m; using
0 here ends all other formats (bold, color) as well.

The "ul" utility, which converts from overstrikes to termcap-based
escape sequences, first appeared in 3.0BSD.

The source code is here:
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3BSD/usr/src/cmd/ul.c

It'd probably be pretty easy to rip out the termcap dependency and have
it just output ansi codes, though I don't know what dialect of C works
on v5.

1BSD to 3BSD also had an "iul" utility which just printed a row of
dashes under characters to be underlined instead of using escape
sequences. In 2.9BSD and 4BSD and later this functionality is provided
by "ul -i".

http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=1BSD/s6/iul.c

It looks like this wouldn't be hard to modify to use escape sequences
instead, and it uses the oldest C dialect of any of these versions.

From 4.1c BSD, ul also handles bold, which is represented by
self-overstriking in the nroff output, and represents superscript and
subscript (half-linefeed) with dim attributes. Any missing attributes
are represented with standout. This is essentially the same
functionality available in modern versions of ul.
