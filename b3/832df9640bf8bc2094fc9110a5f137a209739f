Subject: [pups] AT&T Unix Operating System for Writers Workbench Software?
Message-ID: <000710123233.202002e2@trailing-edge.com>

In a big batch of 9-tracks and RL01 packs rescued this morning, I have
two tapes, one labeled

          AT&T
       ** 66938 **

 UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM FOR
 WRITERS WORKBENCH SOFTWARE

 TPname: LOAD PGM FOR PDP 11/70

the other labeled

          AT&T
       ** 66611 **
  UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM
  WRITERS WORKBENCH SOFTWARE

  TPname: LOAD PGM FOR VAX 11/780 11/750

Both have copyright dates of 1984.  You can see scans of the original
labels (high-res scans, they're big files!) at

  http://www.trailing-edge.com/www/wwtapes/

I won't be able to make binary copies of these until this evening, but does
anyone know where these tapes fit into the scheme of AT&T stuff?  i.e.
are these custom-built SYS III and SYS V systems?  Is the PDP-11/70 tape
perhaps eligible for inclusion in the PUPS archive under the SCO license?

I believe WWB was an offshoot or derivative of PWB, the Programmer's Workbench,
which was a special version of V6.  I think WWB was where "pic" first showed
up.  PWB was, I think V6 with a few extra utilities added.  WWB may be the same.

I don't think what I've found here is that major.  It starts
with a Makefile:

# NOTICE-NOT TO BE DISCLOSED OUTSIDE BELL SYS EXCEPT UNDER WRITTEN AGRMT
#             Makefile: Writer's Workbench system version 2.0.1.10, 5/26/83
#               makefile for the WRITER'S WORKBENCH SYSTEM
#       This package includes over 30 programs that suggest improvements
#       to written documents, including improved versions of the
#       Style  and Diction programs as well as many more writing aids.

and the README says:

       This file gives instructions for building and installing the Writer's
       Workbench system source  code.  This information is also contained
       in the document "UNIX(TM) Writer's Workbench Software Installation
       and Administration Guide."

These particular tapes have been stored in absolutely horrible conditions
(pretty much kept in an outdoors storage shed during both winter and summer for
the past decade) and I'm going to have to bake and/or lubricate them before I
make a not-half-assed attempt at recovering them.  The PDP11/70 tape is
particularly bad (it actually broke when I was just loading it into
the drive!) and it may be a goner.

I don't see any obvious mentions of 'pic' in what I read so far.

Tim,

Writers Work Bench was an extension to the basic troff/nroff tools developed
earlier, but took new directions. It included a whole lot of new programs
like diction (a grammar checker??) which were more to do with the content
than the formatting. I think that pic was developed separately by bwk for a
research version. I have never used WWB but I have some documentation on it
somewhere at home. I believe that it was sold with source as an add on for
various Unicies.

I have a little documentation here, mostly three papers from BSTJ vol. 62
no. 6, July/August 1983. It did contain -- as the makefile says --
'diction' (basically a search for 'bad' phrases), 'style' (which
generated readabilty and other statistics for text), 'punct' (a basic
punctuation checker), and a handful of other similar programs.

Importantly for the PUPS archive, I'm pretty certain that AT&T retained
ownership of WWB when it sold UNIX, so it wouldn't be covered by the SCO
license. I have no idea who owns it now.

'pic', along with troff and such, was in *Documenter's* Workbench.
