That was only possible because of the massive effort to rewrite all things
AT&T out of the BSD source.

On come the emulators.

It's really "middle Unix" you are talking about.  Old Unix and new Unix
(and I don't agree that Linux/*BSD are not Unix) are both now open source.

Unix is a local minimum in the design space.  It can be reimplemented
over and over.
