I'm skeptical as well.

/sbin showed up in 4.3-Reno (1990), but wasn't in 4.3-Tahoe (1988). This
predates Linux by a year or so.  The changes were due to the filesystem
standardization and layout changes prompted by, among other things,
diskless workstations as you stated later.  Sun's NFS drove a lot of the
adaptation in this area since it quickly became the de-facto network file
system (though others did exist).

A big cost savings in having 20 diskless workstations was that you didn't
need the 2-4gb of disks for each individual one, but instead could have one
copy of the 100MB-200MB of the core OS. When. X started getting libraries
out the wazoo with toolkit wars, it saved even more. IIRC, the Sun 3/50's
ethernet port was faster than its disk port, so your diskless workstation
could be faster than one with a disk (assuming the network wasn't
overloaded).

From an era that will be remembered best by "The network is the connector"
corruption of a famous marketing slogan...

All true.
