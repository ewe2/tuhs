Fair enough, Ron. I recall that we had to replace Exabyte drives more often
than 9-track drives. On the other hand, I don't recall ever having an
Exabyte tape go bad, or being unable to restore a lost file (or entire
drive). Replacing a drive was chump change compared to losing a drive.
Plus, the Exabyte tapes were compact, and could easily have a paper label
inserted to indicate what was on them when hundreds were stored
side-by-side on a shelf. My labels were roundly mocked by Tom Limoncelli in
one of his Sysadmin books, but when a user came in wanting a file restored,
being able to identify which tape contained the most recent backup was no
laughing matter (to the user).
