I don't understand how this is significant: most time-sharing OS's don't give
the users access to the memory management control hardware?

Not quite - the semantics available for - and _visible_ to - the user are
constrained by the mechanisms of the underlying hardware.

Consider a machine with a KT11-B - it could not provide support for very small
segments, or be able to adjust the segment size with such small quanta. On the
other side, the KT11-B could support starting a 'software segment' at any
512-byte boundary in the virtual address space, unlike the KT11-C which only
supports 8KB boundaries.
