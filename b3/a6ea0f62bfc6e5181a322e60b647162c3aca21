Hi -

	A few days ago the "getty plays parity games" topic came up
	again.

	I've been thinking about it and looked at the kernel a bit more.
	7e1 is rather firmly in place and I'm not sure turning the 'console'
	(kl/dl) driver into a "LITOUT only" one is a 100% correct way to
	go (the other drivers such as dz, dh, etc remain 7e1 output by
	default).

	Here's a patch for getty/main.c which I think will do what's 
	wanted without having to modify the kernel:

------------snip-------------
*** main.c.dist	Mon Sep  9 16:52:24 2002
--- main.c	Mon Sep  9 16:56:55 2002
***************
*** 384,391 ****
  
  	c = cc;
  	c |= partab[c&0177] & 0200;
! 	if (OP)
! 		c ^= 0200;
  	if (!UB) {
  		outbuf[obufcnt++] = c;
  		if (obufcnt >= OBUFSIZ)
--- 384,401 ----
  
  	c = cc;
  	c |= partab[c&0177] & 0200;
! /*
!  * If "any" parity do nothing otherwise set even parity unless OP is
!  * set.  Since 'ap' is set in the "default" entry of /etc/gettytab this
!  * has the effect of disabling parity on output without having to change
!  * the kernel.
! */
! 	if (!AP) {
! 	   c |= partab[c & 0177] & 0200;
! 	   if (OP)
! 	      c ^= 0200;
! 	}
! 
  	if (!UB) {
  		outbuf[obufcnt++] = c;
  		if (obufcnt >= OBUFSIZ)
--------------snip---------------

	What this does is check the "AP" (AnyParity) flag from /etc/gettytab
	and if NOT set then do the 'even' (or 'odd' if OP is set) parity.

	Since 'ap' is present in the default line of /etc/gettytab the above
	block effectively becomes a no-op unless /etc/gettytab is explicitly
	set for 'ep' or 'op'.

	If someone could test this and report back I'd appreciate it.

	Thanks.
