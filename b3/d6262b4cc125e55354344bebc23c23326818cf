Hi. I announced this in comp.lang.awk in December and tried to BCC
the TUHS list but it didn't seem to happen.  Here's the announcement
I posted.

[ BCC to TUHS list, Brian Kernighan & Chris Ramming ]

	awk 'BEGIN { print "Sherman, set the wayback machine for 1988" }'

Hello All.

This note is to announce that through the valiant efforts of Brian Kernighan,
Alcatel-Lucent has been persuaded to make the source for awkcc available.
It can be found at:

	https://open-innovation.alcatel-lucent.com/projects/awkcc

You have to register (no cost) before being able to download, but
it's easy.  The license terms are at the site.  It's a straightforward
"for personal use" kind of license.

For those who don't know, awkcc is an adaptation of Unix awk to translate
nawk programs into C.  It was originally implemented by Chris Ramming (then
at Bell Labs, although no longer) circa 1988, and the source dist includes
some doc that Chris wrote.

Given how fast machines are these days, this program is mostly of
historical interest.  But it's nice to have this bit of Unix / awk history
generally available.  And, if you really need to turn an awk program into
C, this may provide a starting point.

Enjoy!
