concerning "interactive" I think instead of the V7 sh you rather have
the BSD sh in mind here.

V7 sh didn't know # at all.  At ATT it came with SysIII (both modes).
And keep in mind, stty erase defaulted to # on V7, even until SySV (and 3BSD),
and this character wouldn't have been handy anyway. 4+BSD changed this. 

4.1BSD implemented #, and 4.3 BSD changed it to "non-interactive only".

(And all this is not to be confused with the # hack to exec to csh on 3+BSD,
 only if it's the first character in a script.)


BTW, an academic yet funny example of : side effects is this
: `echo output 1>&2`
