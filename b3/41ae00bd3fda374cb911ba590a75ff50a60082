That's a facet of Thompson's genius--code so clean and right that,
having seen it, one cannot imagine it otherwise. Odds are, though,
that the same program from another hand would not have the same 
aura of inevitability. As Erdos would say of a particularly elegant

proof, "It comes from the Book," i.e. had divine inspiration.
