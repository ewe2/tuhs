Funny that you bring this up as I was just talking to Eric about this.
I was telling him that someone had recently asked me why sendmail was
so complicated, and I explained to them that it was because email wasn't
always like it is today; that there were many disparate email systems and
sendmail glued them all together.  Eric said something like yeah, and I
would have liked to have a better syntax but memory was too constrained
at the time to let me do anything better.
