​Hmm - a little like the halting problem I fear - how can you tell?

I can say we knew about them because Gosling brought them to CMU when he
was a grad student; but by that time, we had started to switched to Unix/TS
and Seventh edition that Ted had brought from BTL.   As I recall, it was
more hacking/surgery then I personally wanted to do in the EE 11/34 based
systems.  I don't think they got added to the SUS or IUS @ CS which were
the other heavy 11/40 machines at the time.

​Not that I remember, but others of course may remember otherwise.

I think many of us knew that Calgary (and Toronto to an extent) was a hot
bed of Unix hacking because of Gosling, but the places outside the US that
were probably having the most effect on the community at the time were in
OZ and the UK.  ​


​Remember Net.noise had not really started as UUCP was part Seventh Edition
so the news systems are in the future.  Also the ArpaNet was limited in
reach, and not that many UNIX sites were apart (it was mostly PDP-10s).
Thus, unless someone came to a USENIX and talked about something, or a
student somehow switch schools (like to be a grad student) folks did not
know about the changes.​   For instance, I knew a little about what was
going on at MIT and UMICH because of friends that left CMU and went to
there or vise versa; and I would bring CMU things to UCB etc...
