Ah, that name rings a bell: the werewolf.

Yes, I used Epsilon 30 years ago as well.  Unlike you, I couldn't get
away from it fast enough.  5 years later I installed GNU Emacs on
Xenix and never looked back.

I used Epsilon mainly because Mince (Mince Is Not Complete Emacs)
didn't work on MS-DOS, but the version I had wasn't compatible enough,
and even the scripting didn't make it work the way I wanted.
