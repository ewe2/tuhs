Subject: [TUHS] SCO vs. IBM: NOVELL steps up to the plate
Message-ID: <Law14-F79hgnFZS4HIv00010252@hotmail.com>



Looks like sco has learned a lot from its cozying up with microsoft that is 
instead of meeting market challenges with better technology and competitive 
pricing against its competitors it resorts to the lowest form bullying 
marketing gimmicks and legal arm twisting  just like microsoft  style , so 
now they look like shooting themselves in the foot , good ! let's hope they 
shoot both feet !.
