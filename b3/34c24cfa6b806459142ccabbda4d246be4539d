Great hint. 20 seconds after I hit send on the original email, I came 
across this:
http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html

Where Brian Kernighan talks about the challenges they faced porting the 
ratfor examples into pascal. He explains that:

    The programs were first written in that dialect of Pascal supported
    by the Pascal interpreter pi provided by the University of
    California at Berkeley. The language is close to the nominal
    standard of Jensen and Wirth,(6
    <http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html#lit-6>) with good
    diagnostics and careful run-time checking. Since then, the programs
    have also been run, unchanged except for new libraries of
    primitives, on four other systems: an interpreter from the Free
    University of Amsterdam (hereinafter referred to as VU, for Vrije
    Universiteit), a VAX version of the Berkeley system (a true
    compiler), a compiler purveyed by Whitesmiths, Ltd., and UCSD Pascal
    on a Z80. All but the last of these Pascal systems are written in C.

So, you were right about it being Joy's pi.

Thanks,

Will
