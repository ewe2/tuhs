Thanks a lot for all advices! Now I think I've got two problems now -
one is to implement backup
(which is unrelated here), and one, for fun, to make device working.
I've got drive and have just got
full vintage cabinet full of tapes to experiment on :) (since company
where I've got that box with a drive
decided to move all their old trash to local scrap and I talked them
into giving that tapes cabinet to me,
including contents. I just don't know what stuff is on these tapes,
but that in itself is intriguing :)

All the best,
S.
