Idris from Whitesmiths once passed through my hands... I actually
skipped that one for UniPlus SysIII and SysV  on the
Perkin-Elmer 7350 box with a dip packaged  68000...

I ran Coherent until I got  the hardware to go 386-BSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD,
and Linux 0.99.xx (SLS and later Slackware).

Before the UniPlus I ran Xenix-86 on an AT&T 6300 with a Nec V30 (not a
6300+ 286 box).
