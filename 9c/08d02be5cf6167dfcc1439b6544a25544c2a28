"Test only" means no binary files.  (UUCP or MIME encoded).

No images / no warz / no pr0n / etc.

I'm sure that something does occasionally slip through.  But it should 
be such a rarity that nobody notices.

It also means that a number of the *.bin.* (et al) newsgroups are omitted.

"Text only" is just a generic classification and way of saying that I'm 
not going to provide binary content.  Read:  Go get that from one of the 
big professional players.  ;-)

There is the NNTPS variant of running NNTP over SSL (TLS), but that 
binary component is just the transport, not the protocol that runs 
through it.

That being said, I think there there may be a tiny bit of binary to 
NNTP.  Or at least every time I've looked at it with tcpdump / 
Wirershark there was something about the replies from the receiving 
server that make me think that ACKs / NAKs may be binary.  But chances 
are good that I'm not paying enough attention and misinterpreting something.
