Ultrix-32m 1.0 also has dbx, with dates no later than August '83.  These
dates mostly correspond to the 4.2 source tree on TUHS (
https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.2BSD/usr/src/ucb/dbx ) but
not exactly - the 4.2 tree has a newer object.c, implying that DEC was
getting early copies of 4.2.  The later fixes in Ultrix 1.1 also imply that
DEC was getting regular updates from UCB.
