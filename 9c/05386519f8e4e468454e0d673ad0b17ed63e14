Subject: [TUHS] why does tar have the tape device hard coded into it and
 why is it mt1 instead of mt0

First, the device # should be usable from the command line, i.e.  tar cv0
foo

As for mt, it was written for the tape device and in those days most of us
had at least one 9-track device.    I have no memory of why Ken used mt1
not mt0.   Doug may know.
