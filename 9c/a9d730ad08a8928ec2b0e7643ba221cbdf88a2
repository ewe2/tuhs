Subject: [pups] Help! Standalone DZ-11 driver
Message-ID: <200101290124.f0T1Ois26299@henry.cs.adfa.edu.au>

Hi all,
	I'm working on a new version of my Vtserver, which allows a PDP-11
with no tape drive to boot from a Unix/Linux server (via serial cable) and
install a UNIX. See ftp://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/pub/PDP-11/Vtserver

At present I'm working on a new version which uses the 2.11BSD boot code
so as to support more disk drives. The work in progress is at:
http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/Vtserver. At present it's not usable
unless you have a PDP-11/45.

I've got a potential user with an 11/34, two RK05s and a DZ-11. I can't
find any details of DZ-11 here in my peripherals handbooks, and the 2.11
kernel drivers are a bit too complicated to read.

My existing KL-11 driver is below. Can someone come up with a standalone
equivalent for a DZ-11, or point me at some docs?

I'll be away from 1st to 14th Feb, so there may be some delays in
responding.

Thanks all,
	Warren

Warren,
Why not do this as a terminal emulator that can switch into emulating a
tape drive by some start/stop messaging using the console device.  You
could upload a simple bootstrap using ODT that could then read a more
complex boot driver in.  If you use the console then that shoud be
universal across all PDP11s.
