I seem to recall the story was an early IBM Series 1 port.   Seemed to
recall them relating that at a UNIX Users Group meeting.

The NUXI problem on the Interdata 7/32, when the University of Wollongong
did the port of Sixth Edition.

I can't find a link to the actual story, but from memory the system printed
"NUXI" out when it was first booted.
