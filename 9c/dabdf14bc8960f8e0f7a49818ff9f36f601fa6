In the "15 minutes" that I worked in Center 1127, I reported
to Fred. When he interviewed me for the job in his office
the conversation wandered around to the German Enigma machine.

"What a great thing to actually see one some day." I said.

"Oh?" asked Fred, reaching down pulling open the bottom drawer of
his metal desk.=20

A tug at a fabric covered wooden box, making a sliding, banging noise
on the metal draw as he withdrew it, and plopped it on the disk in
front of me.  Popping open the catches he lifted the lid and there was
the enigmatic enigma in front of me, open for me to touch.

We spent the rest of the interview with him explaining the=20
the workings of the device. What a pleasure it was.
