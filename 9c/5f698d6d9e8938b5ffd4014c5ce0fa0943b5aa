On second thought, given that the Worldnet outage was late 1996, it was most=
 likely that the backups were to 8mm tape. Exabyte?!

 used to help my father with his statistical research, processing what at th=
e time seemed massive census and similar data sets on 9 track tape (using PL=

ng through old audio tapes and digitizing them (https://notes.technologists.=
com/notes/2021/08/21/making-private-1960s-and-70s-recordings-public/). Some a=
re over 50 years old and still seem as good to me as when they were recorded=
. Others, I can anticipate from the brand/formulation that they are going to=
 be trouble, if salvageable at all. Most surprisingly, unbranded and similar=
 budget tapes have survived as well or better than some of the high-priced s=
tuff. A few days ago I tried a reel from 1968. I was dismayed by how many ti=
mes it had been spliced, but replace the splicing tape and found it viable.
