They might actually.  Gates isnâ€™t in charge, and there has been a major effort to being Linux compatibility into the Windows 10 kernel.

The biggest issue will be the never ending tangle of licenses, if they had other stuff integrated into there.

Call me a cynical old bastard (which I am), but I can't see M$ raising a 
flag for Unix...  Wasn't it Billy Gates who reportedly said that any PC 
running Linux is one not running Windoze, and did his best to discredit 
it?

I still have horrible memories of porting Unify (an early RDBMS) to Xenix, 
and getting tangled up in the poxy small/large memory models on the 
equally-poxy 286 (no, not the 386).
