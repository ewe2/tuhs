support for PDP-11 was added to gcc a few months ago.  I don't think
it's been well tested, but support exists in current versions of
binutils and gcc.

http://pdp11.nocrew.org/

there's also support for the m68hc11/12 which are 16-bit.

it seems like support for 80{,1,2}86 in gcc should be possible; it just
hasn't been done yet.

another compiler that might be worth looking at is SDCC
http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/ which is currently targeted towards 8-bit
MCUs.

of course bootstrapping via the original K&R compiler would be the
"classic" way to do it, though.  ;)
