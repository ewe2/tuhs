Hi Bakul,

> Thanks, didn't know about q.  However, nvi doesn't have q.

It's just a means of recording typing into a register.  Exactly the same
can be achieved by typing into the buffer and then yanking into the
named register, being careful to leave off the LF at the end of the line
if it's not wanted, e.g. «"qy$».

If `3wy' yanked three words then the macro in register `q' could start
with `y' allowing `3w at q' to pass a region to the macro, but it doesn't.
:-)  I think one's left with setting a mark, or using automatic ones set
at various times by vim, and the macro using those to know its region.
