Yup, It was spec'ed at least a year ahead and its the code was
committed before the standard was even in a draft vote.

Although different from and the missing stuff was a bear.  Originally,
VT100 !=3D  X3.64       which has caused many issues over the years.  The b=
ig
issue was the lack of a proper insert/delete, it used scrolling regions
instead.  Kudos to Mary Ann for working through that whole mess years ago!
That's why back in the day, I preferred the H19 and later the Ambassador ;-=
)

My memory is that was ECMA that got the DEC changes/differences added/put
back/made legal.  But originally, there were not.   At one point, I had a
copy of the internal DEC documentation (which I think I got from Tom Kent
who wrote much of the rom code and had been on the committee for DEC at one
point, but I don't remember).
