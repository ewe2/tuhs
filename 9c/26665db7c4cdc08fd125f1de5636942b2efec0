Some years ago, I asked a engineer friend about the ceramic terminal =
strips
(and accompanying spool of silver solder) that I had seen in Tektronix =
scopes.
He responded by asking me what a terminal strip was supposed to do.

Erm, make connections and provide physical stability between some wires =
while
keeping all the connections insulated from each other?  He said "yup", =
that's
what these strips do.  In particular, they aren't capacitors, resistors, =
or
inductors to any significant degree...

On a vaguely related note, I found it amusing that there was a well =
known hack
for Cray's (or perhaps 6600's) which were misbehaving: put a Tektronix =
scope
probe on a test point that generally had one there during final system =
checkout.
The load (extremely mnimal by design) was just enough to stabilize the =
system.
