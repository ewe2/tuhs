> Both of the 2bsd tapes you found are from the days when Berkeley just sent
patches to the 7th Edition out. The 2.8BSD tape was the first one to have a
kernel that was bootable from the tape. The 2BSD tapes originally had 2
files on them. The first one was a binary copy of tar that ran on V7. The
second was a tarball of all the rest. As you discovered, they shipped with
a label like:
        Second Berkeley Software Tape
        May 10, 1979    TAR 800BPI

        %dd if=/dev/mt0 bs=1b skip=1 of=tar
        %chmod 755 tar
        % tar x

        10000 blocks
but the 2bsd.tar.gz file has just the second file.

The spensor_2bsd.tar.gz has a tar binary in it:

tar tvf spencer_2bsd.tar.gz | head
-rw-r--r--  0 0      0       24688 Feb 17  1980 tar
-rw-r--r--  0 0      10       3687 Feb 17  1980 tar.1
-rw-r--r--  0 0      10        456 Feb 17  1980 tar.ms
-rw-r--r--  0 0      10      15216 Feb 17  1980 install.ms

if you are looking for that pre-built. If you are looking to create a tape
with tar on it to extract other tar tapes, you'd need to use a variation on
the maketape.pl with a block size of 1 so the above dd will work on the
target system...
