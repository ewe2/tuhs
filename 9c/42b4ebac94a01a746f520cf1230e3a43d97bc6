All of SCO's statements to the court have been contractual.  Their
statements to the press have been inflated to include things that
aren't actually alledged in the court filings.

That's the rub.  Do they, in point of fact, actually have any code
they own the Copyright to or the patent rights to?

SCO is blustering more and more as the open source community exposes
them for the fruads that they have become.
