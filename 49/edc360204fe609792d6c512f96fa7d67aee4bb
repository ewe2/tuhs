I have my own types.h that I carry around that has stuff like 

    typedef unsigned char           u8;
    typedef unsigned short          u16;
    typedef unsigned int            u32;
    typedef unsigned long long      u64;
    typedef signed char             i8;
    typedef signed short            i16;
    typedef signed int              i32;
    typedef signed long long        i64;

and I wonder why the original Unix authors didn't make something similar?
Instead we have uint64_t and I don't see the added value of more chars.
