One of my first contracts with IBM was to add (get this) a SECOND =
network interface to secure-XENIX, an MLS version of the software.
I believe it was being used as a =E2=80=9Cdowngrade=E2=80=9D audit =
station to allow data to be moved form one secure network to another.    =
I believe the
original work was done by Jakob Recktor (probably butchering the =
spelling of his name).

That contract led to a few follow ons with IBM to port AIX to i860 based =
machines.    I still have my old IBM badge kicking around somewhere.
