Seeing this question, I figured "it can't be that hard", and managed to
get tinyhttpd  http://tinyhttpd.sourceforge.net/ to compile on 2.11BSD.
Mostly just required K&R-ification, though I also had to fix some bugs
in the way it uses buffers to get it to work at all. Normal GET requests
work; The whole CGI thing I disabled because I couldn't get it to work
reliably even on modern linux.

Not actually tested, though - I couldn't get simh to emulate a network
device.
