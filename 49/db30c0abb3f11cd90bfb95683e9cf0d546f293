A big issue/hurdle I suspect is that AIX/386 was done for a PS/2 HW;
(microchannel) which besides IBM and NCR, there is not a lot of in the
wild.   So simulation might be a PITA.â€‹  Also the graphics was done for
some IBM specific displays (I've forgotten the names), that nobody else
made (which were really expensive at the time IIRC -- which again may have
been an issue on why this was not popular).

We had a lot of Gateway 386 (ISA/EISA based) PC's at Locus which were the
system of choice we used for TNC prototyping and all we had in Boston and
San Diego.   The LA guys must have had AIX running on them; but I'm not
sure if that code was ever released.  I'd have to ask some one like
Hopfield who would have done that kind of hacking.
