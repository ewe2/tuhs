*whoops*. 

I've been mailing personal replies, instead of replies to the list. Too much
relying on procmail, I suppose.

It's a 11/53+ (aka: 1.5 MB RAM), which *should* be able to run 2.11BSD.

There is a Macro-assembler, and reportedly a PASCAL compiler. However, my
Micro/RSX skills (let alone -programming skills) should be considered 
rudimentary - the only resource I have is the on-line helpfile (which isn't
very clear every now and then).

The "RX33" is working (that's how I was able to low-level format two
MFM disks, and how I got Kermit running). And yes, I have a Minix-VMD box
with a 5.25" HD drive.

For the sake of completeness, I'll include the currently available 
hardware:

KJD11-D/S   (processor), DZQ11, TK50, RQDX3 with one RD32A, a third-party
21MB MFM disk (ST225, RD33? 31? Something like that), a second 21MB
MFM disk standing by (A microscribe of some sort), a 5.25" PC floppy 
drive shoe-horned into a RX33, and a DELQA card.

(Well, that's what I have installed right now. I do have some other cards,
 including a DRV11-J "Hi-density parallell line unit" and some strange
 VG-Electronics cards (which they claim are specific to surface analysis))

And a spare TK50 mechanic..

Well... you can borrow one of my TK50s with 2.11 on it ;-)

If you need a TK50 with 2.11 on it I could produce one for you (provided
that you have jumped through all the license hoops).  The only sticky
point might be shipping, where are you located?  I'm travelling a lot
this month, so it may take a week or so to get it done.

	Indeed it should be able to.   I personally have not done so but the
	processor/mmu meet all the criteria and 1.5MB is perfect.

> The "RX33" is working (that's how I was able to low-level format two

	I have a "RX33" on my 11/73 so I can create a boot  disk and the
	root filesystem dump (split over 3 or 4 1.2MB disk images).

	It is going to take some creative symlink and mount point work to
	fit 2.11 into 20MB disks - the system really expects to have ~80MB
	at least for /usr.   An RD54 at 159MB is more than enough but a RD53
	paired with a couple RD32/3 would be adequate.
