Subject: [TUHS] Why root user name?
Message-ID: <20150916195039.GA27635@www.oztivo.net>

As I was dropping off to sleep last night, I wondered why the superuser
account on Unix is called root.

There's a hierarchy of directories and files beginning at the tree root /.
There's a hierarchy of processes rooted with init. But there's no hierarchy
of users, so why the moniker "root"?

Any ideas?

Cheers, Warren
