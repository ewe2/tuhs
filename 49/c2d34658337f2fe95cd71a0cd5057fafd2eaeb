Has this been covered before? I=E2=80=99ve searched but not found an =
obvious answer, which would be a timeline, not a table.

Has anyone roughly calculated =E2=80=9Cman years=E2=80=9D spent =
developing Unix to 1973 or 1974?
Under 25 "man-years=E2=80=9D? (person years now)

It compares favourably to the quoted =E2=80=9C5,000 man years over 4 =
years=E2=80=9D invested by IBM for the 1st million lines of OS/360 - =
which by 1978 was estimated a 10M LOC.

In my reading on Multics, I=E2=80=99d not noticed a =E2=80=98man =
years=E2=80=99 estimate, thought the project ran from 1965 to 1985 when =
Honeywell =E2=80=98capped=E2=80=99 development and span off a commercial =
entity [ Bell Labs leaving April 1969 ].
There were many releases of Multics beginning with "MR 1.0=E2=80=9D in =
1974 to =E2=80=9CMR 11.0=E2=80=9D in 1984, with some others later.=20
	<https://www.multicians.org/chrono.html>

Cobato in 1977 wrote that by 1969, when it moved out of =E2=80=98developme=
nt only=E2=80=99, 150 man-years were spent on software.
	<https://rcs.uwaterloo.ca/~ali/cs854-f17/papers/multics.pdf>


The original Unix group working with the PDP-11 on the 6th floor should =
be well known, but I can=E2=80=99t recall seeing a list.
Would the first 1973 conferenceor 1974 CACM paper be the natural cut-off =
date for an =E2=80=98original' group?

There=E2=80=99s a list of "Former members of 1127=E2=80=9D maintained =
on-line.
As an outsider who doesn=E2=80=99t know ppl & dates, can=E2=80=99t =
extract what I was interested in.
	<https://www.spinroot.com/gerard/1127_alumni.html>

There was a constraint on active users / concurrent logins in the =
=E2=80=9CAttic": the number of connected terminals & desks there.
Assuming it took time to get terminals installed elsewhere, then later =
dedicated phone lines and 300 baud modems outside.

The typesetter used by the patent dept isn=E2=80=99t mentioned.
I=E2=80=99ve a recollection it was fed by mag tape, but unsure of that =
source.

Infer at least the people named in the piece, which looks very sparse:

	Ken & Dennis :)
	Morris
	Cherry
	Kernighan

	Plus Joe Osanna working on roff / troff? [ do I have that wrong =
]

The 1971 =E2=80=9C1st Edition=E2=80=9D Manual Intro lists 4 names. No =
others appear in Sections 1, 3, 6, 7 [ commands & libraries ]

ml>

	ken K. Thompson
	dmr D. M. Ritchie
	jfo J. F. Ossanna
	rhm R. Morris

In June 1974, Dennis wrote in the preface to the Version 5 manual, with =
he and Ken named as authors.

An Oral History of Unix

	The center of Unix activity was a sixth-floor room at Murray =
Hill which contained the PDP-11 that ran Unix.
		"Don't think of a fancy laboratory, but it was a room up =
in the attic," as Morris describes it.=20

	In addition to the programmers, four secretaries from the patent =
department worked in the attic,=20
		performing the text-processing tasks for which Unix was =
ostensibly developed.=20

Robert Morris:
	We all worked in the same room.=20
	We worked all up in an attic room on the sixth floor, in Murray =
Hill.=20
	In space that maybe was one and a half times the size of this =
hotel room.=20
	We were sitting at adjacent terminals, and adjacent, and we knew =
each other and we always in fact ate lunch together.=20
	Shared a coffeepot.=20
	So, it was a very close relationship and most of us were both =
users and contributors and there was a significant initiative for =
research contribution at all points.
