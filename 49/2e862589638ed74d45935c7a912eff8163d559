My memory is clearly that B did not use line numbers.   However, it
did report line numbers for errors.  The 'ed' command had an 'n'
command that would number the lines of the file -- I think this was a
result of an early customer for Unix being the patent department -- at
the time, patents had to have exactly 50 lines on each page with no
blanks and the lines had to be numbered...   When writing about a
program, it was handy to include line numbers so the document could
refer more easily to lines in the program, but they weren't fed to the
compiler.

Are those BASIC-style line numbers?

I honestly can't remember; I think it was the Aberystwyth sysadmin
(Rob Ash) who write a B prettifier (the cited BTIDY) but I can't
remember whether B as a language used/ignored line numbers, or if this
was just a prettyprint thing.

There are mentions of line numbers
in https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/btut.pdf [3] so perhaps they
are a compiler convenience for diagnostics?
