Looks like the average marketing droid stuff... I like the way SCO
appear to not want anything to do with kernels 2.0.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x or 2.5.x
even though that graph clearly shows UnixWare getting "contributions"
from the Linux 2.2.x tree - case of someone being too quick with the
highlight methinks.

And, with all this SCO talk about SVR6 and about how good SCO UNIX is..
how come OpenServer feels very antiquated, and UnixWare very trashy
and amateur?

meep, another "asmodai" :)
