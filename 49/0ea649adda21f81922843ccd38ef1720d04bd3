Odd; I have a clear recollection that UNSW's driver (or was it Basser?) 
did not use interrupts (too slow, as you point out) but used the clock 
interrupt to empty the silos every so often.  I'd check the source in the 
Unix Archive, but I don't remember which disk image it's in; what I do 
remember was that it went like a bat out of hell, and Elec Eng had 
something like eight of them on their 11/70.

Can anyone confirm or deny this?

We also had a DZ-11 on our 11/60 (and the 11/40 before that), and it 
worked OK, keeping the DJ-11 company.
