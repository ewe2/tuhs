The biggest differences between BSD4.1 and BSD4.1c were the addition of FFS
in 4.1b (we have 4.1a from Kirk's DVD, as well as 4.1 and two versions of
4.1c). There's no ufs that I can detect in V8 though.

If we look at the vm, the 4.1c.2 files are from 83, the 4.1 files are from
80 and the v8 files are from 81.

Kirk's DVD has a 4.1.snap on it that lines up more closely with at least
the vm files. I don't recall what these files are from. It's not present in
the TUHS archives that I see. This snapshot is about a year after 4.1BSD
release, but maybe 18 months before the 4.1a snapshot.
