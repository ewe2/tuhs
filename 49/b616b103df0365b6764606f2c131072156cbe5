I have two compilers ;)

One compiler which creates "unsegmented binaries". The assembler code which
is generated only uses 16bit pointer addresses (r0-r15) and only works on
segment 0.

This compiler is for example used to compile the boot loaders and standalone
utilities iirc and other "small" binaries on my SYSIII.

There is also a "segmented compiler" which uses the 32bit registers (rr0-rr14)
to store the pointer adresses.
It is currently used for compiling the SYSIII kernel (which is much  
bigger than
the 2.11 BSD kernel I saw) and all other "to big" binaries.

And this would mean that "such a compiler exists" (referencing to your
mail) and I could or should port 4.3 BSD?
