Unfortunately that does not include the old troff written in PDP-11
assembly.
The v6 tape and file system contain traces of it in the directory
/usr/source/s7, so we at least know (some of) the file names:

Now it could be that v7 troff is perfectly capable of generating the
manual just like older troff would have, I just haven't dived more
deeply into it all yet. I was more concerned about reconstructing the
actual content rather than the exact looks for now, but it's still
something i want to get right eventually.


This didn't go through the list but I'll reply here:
