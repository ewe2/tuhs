I didn't help with all that, I was pretty butthurt at the time.  I've
gotten over that but I'm still butthurt that Git won.  It's a really
shitty answer.  I can give you guys a writeup I did recently but I don't
want to spam the list.

I'd be 100% OK with BitKeeper not winning if Git was at parity or better
than BitKeeper, but that's not the case.  It's trivial to do a BK to
Git exporter, it's really hard to do the other direction, Git records
far less information.

It's pretty much what I predicted back in the early 2000's.  If you don't
leave space for commercial companies to make money and pay people to try
and reach for the better answer, you're gonna get mediocre answers.  And
here we are.
