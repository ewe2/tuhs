Subject: [TUHS] shared memory on Unix

The presence of some sort of shared memory facility in the
BBN V6 Unix kernel got me thinking about the origins of
shared memory on Unix.

I had a vague recollection that primordial versions were present
in either PWB or CB3, but a quick glance at the source indicates
that this is not correct.

What are the origins of shared memory on Unix, i.e. what came
before mmap() and SysV IPC? Was the BBN kernel the first to
implement such a facility on Unix?
