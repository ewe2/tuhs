I'll say it again: it's *definitely* how SPL worked (at least, on the 
11/70 that I hung; too many witnesses...).  Somewhere Out There (tm) is a 
little self-relocating program that completely filled user memory with SPL 
(including overwriting itself; the last act it did was to overwrite 
itself, and was sheer genius).  I saw it in a ;login: newsletter, so it 
*might* be in AUUGN...  When the PC wrapped around, it was SPLs all the 
way down :-)

Likely a firmware bug?
