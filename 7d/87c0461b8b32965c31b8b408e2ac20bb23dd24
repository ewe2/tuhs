I never got around to reading that book until I'd been a sysadmin for
about twenty years, and it was still a revelation.  I thought I'd just
skim through it to sort of check it off the list, but I ended up
learning a lot of great stuff.

That one, and Kernighan and Pike: "The Practice of Programming", are two
books I keep recommending to people.
