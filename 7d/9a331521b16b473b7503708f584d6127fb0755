Dunno; I taught myself FORTRAN-II after winning a book at school (yes, 
really!), and somehow ploughed through WATFOR (urk!) and WATFIV (a bit 
better) in my early CompSci classes, then was allowed to use FORTRAN-G in 
later on.

And if we promised to behave ourselves i.e. debug the program on FORTRAN-G 
first then we were allowed to use FORTRAN-H (which needed a special code 
on the JOB card, as I recall).

Never used the abomination since...
