You should try living in Australia :-)  It was a political plaything for 
quite a while, until it finally stabilised (except for the Sydney Olympics 
in 2000).  Neither QLD nor WA have it.  Broken Hill, a city in NSW, 
observes Central Time.  And there was something odd about the railway line 
at Echuca at one time (did it observe Central Time once, despite being in 
VIC?)...
