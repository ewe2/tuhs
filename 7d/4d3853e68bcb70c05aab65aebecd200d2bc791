Apparently it's difficult.  Or people aren't sufficiently motivated.

I know that I personally can't do it.

Yep.  I used to have aspirations of reading RFCs.  But work and life=20

I typically see this from the authoritative server side.  I've=20
experienced this (at least) once myself and have multiple colleagues=20
that have also experienced this (at least) once themselves too.

If the primary name server is offline for some reason (maintenance,=20
outage, hardware, what have you) clients start reporting a problem that=20
manifests itself as a complete failure.  They seem to not fall back to=20
the secondary name server.

I'm not talking about "slowdown" complaints.  I'm talking about=20
"complete failure" and "inability to browse the web".

I have no idea why this is.  All the testing that I've done indicate=20
that clients fall back to secondary name servers.  Yet multiple=20
colleagues and myself have experienced this across multiple platforms.

It's because of these failure symptoms that I'm currently working with a =

friend & colleague to implement VRRP between his name servers so that=20
either of them can serve traffic for both DNS service IPs / Virtual IPs=20
(VIPs) in the event that the other server is unable to do so.

We all agree that a 5 ~ 90 second (depending on config) outage with=20
automatic service continuation after VIP migration is a LOT better than=20
end users experiencing what are effectively service outages of the=20
primary DNS server.

Even in the outages, the number of queries to the secondary DNS=20
server(s) don't increase like you would expect as clients migrate from=20
the offline primary to the online secondary.

In short, this is a big unknown that I, and multiple colleagues, have=20
seen and can't explain.  So, we have each independently decided to=20
implement solutions to keep the primary DNS IP address online using what =

ever method we prefer.

I completely agree that per all documentation, things SHOULD work with=20
just the secondary.  Yet my experience from recursive DNS server=20

Sure.  That's the nature of a wireless network.  It's also unrelated to=20

I try to avoid dealing with IDNs.  Fortunately I'm fairly lucky in doing =

My understanding is that DNSSEC provides verifiable authenticity of the=20
information transported by DNSSEC.  It's also my understanding that=20
DTLS, DOH, DNScrypt, etc provide DNS /transport/ encryption=20
(authentication & privacy).

As I understand it, there is nothing about DTLS, DOH, DNScrypt, etc that =

prevent servers on the far end of said transports from modifying queries =

/ responses that pass through them, or serving up spoofed content.

To me, DNSSEC serves a completely different need than DTLS, DOH,=20
DNScrypt, etc.

Please correct me and enlighten me if I'm wrong or have oversimplified=20
things.

DANE has been waiting on that for a while.

I think DANE does require DNSSEC.  I think DKIM does too.

I've never had the pleasure of messing with Plan9.  It's on my=20

The nature of email is (and has been) changing.

We're no longer trying to use 486s to manage mainstream email.  My=20
opinion is that we have the CPU cycles to support current standards.

SMTP over TLS (STARTTLS) is just a transport.  I can send anything I=20
want across said transport.

DKIM is about enabling downstream authentication in email.  Much like=20
DNSSEC does for DNS.

There is nothing that prevents sending false information down a secure=20
communications channel.

Hum.  That's contrary to my understanding.  Do you happen to have RFC=20
and section numbers handy?  I've wanted to, needed to, go read more on=20
S/MIME.  It now sounds like I'm missing something.

I wonder if the same can be said about PGP.

I thought that many MUAs handled that problem by adding the sender as an =

additional recipient in the S/MIME structure.  That way the sender could =

extract the ephemeral key using their private key and decrypt the=20
encrypted message that they sent.
