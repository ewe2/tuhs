That word, effectively, is an important one. Being so small, I expected the
editor to lack a scripting language. I was pleasantly surprised that it
does have one, and that it's a c derivative rather than lisp, a fine
language but not my favorite one. "Extensible and modifiable" doesn't
always mean the same thing to everyone, and well, you're a kernel hacker.
