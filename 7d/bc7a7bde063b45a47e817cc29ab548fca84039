Hmm... my 7th Edition distribution  /usr/sys/dev/rl.c  certainly *does*
have rlopen() and rlclose().  If you want them, I can send rl.c and the
matching mkconf.c  to you, or to Warren, along with the rl1conf and rl2conf
(for RL01 and RL02 disks) from  /usr/sys/conf/  and any other files needed
(if someone can tell me what might be required -- it's a long long time
since I looked at any of this.   The distribution came for an 11/23 with 2
x RL02, and it also has some special source files for 11/23, 11/34, etc
("small machines") including tests for recovery from segmentation traps in
floating point (which isn't the same on all PDP-11 models), and an RK
driver from the Boston Children's Museum which handles overlapped seeks on
multiple drives.

I'll be away for a couple of days so don't expect a prompt reply, but the
source is online here so I can easily copy a few files when I get back.
