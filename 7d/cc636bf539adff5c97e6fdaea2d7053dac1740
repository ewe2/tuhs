Bakul provided an explanation for the pipeline, the funny cue to me
that I interpreted from Warner's message is just that emacs had the
ability to do it in a coherent way but did not and ISTM that the way
you make a mess of that is by losing the intent of the representation.
I am regularly surprised by how surprising type systems are to
computing professionals.  The language and environment may help or
dissuade you from doing that, wasn't really relevant to my original
point.

Larry tells me the message is somehow inflammatory, it wasn't intended
that way I was just trying to make light of the situation and provide
people a launch pad to think for themselves about some fundamentals
because it's worthwhile to do so occasionally.

The only response I can come up with to these two points eventually
boils down to a philosophical riddle:  does the work matter or does
how the work is done matter?  Both, the situation dictates.  I execute
innumerable shell pipelines per day and perhaps craft a dozen
ephemerals ones.
