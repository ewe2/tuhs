Problem found; I had the audacity to elevate the security on my router 
from "medium" to "custom" (so I could define some IP blocks against some 
persistent spam sources) and it took out NTP/WHOIS/RSYNC/you-name-it as 
well; I'd say that it helpfully blocked all UDP or something.

The filters never did work anyway; if ever you see a Sagecomm F at st 5355 
(yeah, a wanky name, so you can imagine the target audience) wireless 
router then run, do not walk, away from it, as it's a bucket of putrid 
snot.
