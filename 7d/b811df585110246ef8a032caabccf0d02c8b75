Case do matter.

Shorter form: "\033[H\033[J"

Not really. It's way more advanced than that.

If we start with the generic clear screen, it is CSI Pn J

Where CSI can be expressed as ESC [ (or "\033[" in the same parlance as 
above.)

Pn, then is an argument to the function, while J is the actual function 
(clear screen in this case).

Now, Pn can cause many things:

0	Clear from cursor to end of screen
1	Clear from cursor to end of screen
2	Clear from beginning of screen to cursor
3	Clear whole screen

If no argument is given, the default is 0.

Probably true. However, I'm not sure Ann Arbor or Heathkit did much 
better. As far as I can remember, they were always more "weird", but I 
might just be confused. However, curses(3) is definitely a good way of 
not having to care about different terminal oddities.

Yeah, the VT52 was simpler, and had shorter control strings. But of 
course, with the additional limitations that came with that.

Personally, I'd give an AAA or a Heathkit away if one was dropped on me. 
A VT100 I would keep. :-)
