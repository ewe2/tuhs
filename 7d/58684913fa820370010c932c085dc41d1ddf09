Well said.  The markup language was clearly inspired by Scribe, which
was quite popular in Academia (at least) at the time.

As a *markup language*, I personally find it superior to anything
else currently in use, but that's a whole different discussion that
on TUHS inevitably degenerates into the current spate of ranting,
so I won't start on it.

Wow. Is that still maintained?
