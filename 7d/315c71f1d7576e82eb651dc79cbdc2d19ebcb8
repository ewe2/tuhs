Pathalias is distributed as part of Smail 3 in the pd/pathalias directory.
It is version 10 with a few changes.  Smail is currently available at
<ftp://ftp.planix.com/pub/Smail/smail-BETA.tar.gz>.  It was also in
Ubuntu up through 8.10 Intrepid, and as such should be available in
Ubuntu old release archives, probably accessible with some pain.
