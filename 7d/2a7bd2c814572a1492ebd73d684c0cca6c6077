I checked the CSRG archive CDs.  The line was added, as shown, in
4.2BSD:

Sadly, humour is no longer modern.  A while back I updated the
documentation to gdb(4) in FreeBSD, and added under BUGS:

  The debugging macros
  .Dq "just growed" .
  In general, the person who wrote them did so while looking for a specific
  problem, so they may not be general enough, and they may behave badly when used
  in ways for which they were not intended, even if those ways make sense.

And people took exception to "just growed" and converted it to "just
grown"!  Not just a lack of humour, but also a lack of understanding
of literature and grammar.  Somehow people take things too seriously
nowadays.
