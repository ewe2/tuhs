Ahh, that adds an extra wrinkle to the proceedings :) I wasn't aware of this
version, I was just going on what I disassembled and what I could dig up from
unix sources, but neither am I too surprised that there were intermediate
steps in between!

It is as you note, a very confused picture where there was a lot of activity
from several different sources. It's pretty amazing to look at the UNSW and
Usenet archives and see the sheer volume of device and library hacks that were
going on during the v5 and v6 period alone.

On a related question, do we know that sources for code such as the ching
binaries was at least around at the time of the 32V port? I'm unsure when the
sources were lost, was that after V7? A reason I ask is that phx basically
remained untouched but the 32V version of cno was definitely changed in the
early BSDs, although it may have been a binary patch.
