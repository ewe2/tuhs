Subject: [TUHS] C-news is built
Message-ID: <20170310094919.GA22414@minnie.tuhs.org>

OK, Geoff Collyer has built the C-News binaries for the 4.2 emulated
systems. They are temporarily at http://minnie.tuhs.org/Y5/Cnews/

Does someone want to try and get them up and running on an emulated system?

Also, I've build a 4.3BSD version of the emulated uucp systems. It's a
separate branch at https://github.com/DoctorWkt/4bsd-uucp. You can get it
by doing:

git clone https://github.com/DoctorWkt/4bsd-uucp.git \
	--branch 4.3BSD --single-branch

Once it's solid enough I will make this the default branch, but I'll
leave the 4.2BSD branch there as well.

Thanks Geoff!
