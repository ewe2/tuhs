Assuming I can read the tape, I know I do have a copy of 4.1a distribution
on 9-track.

Diomidis is correct, 4.1a use Joy/Cooper/Leffler reimplementation of of the
BBN stack, not the original BBN stack.

The BBN stack (Gurwitz et al) was for 4.1 (and other UNIX and non-Unix
systems).   I do not believe I have a copy of that tape.  Rob or maybe Eric
Cooper might.

How Sam added the code into the UCB SCCS, I never knew (you can ask him
directly, he is still findable these days).   Eric Cooper took the basic
BBN distribution and put it on the UCB 4.1 systems around campus >>before<<
Joy started the sockets work.   i.e. the installation was done by
installing 4.1, then taking the BBN tape and installing it as is. Cooper
helped me put it on the CAD machines in Cory Hall circa '81.   I then
helped Eric Allmen put it on the Ingres systems (again Cory Hall) shortly
thereafter [Please, remember, this was the "official" IP/TCP implementation
for UNIX.   Joy's work was an "underground" effort in response to CMU's
Accent].



BTW: about 3 years later, the BBN2 stack comes out from Rob and team and it
is actually even more interesting; because it now uses the sockets
interface (not the Chaosnet/UofI nami trick), and adds a number of both
performance enhancements (Van Jacobson's work, etc.) as well as a more
complete implementation of the IP stack.   I >>might<< have a copy of that
tape squirreled away; but I'll have to look.
