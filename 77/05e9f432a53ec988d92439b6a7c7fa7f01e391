I have a scanned copy of Organick from MIT that says Copyright 1972 (and
has a stamp from the Barker Engineering Library listing May 16, 1972 as the
acquisition date).  I can't see any indication that this is anything other
than the first printing. Corbato's forward is dated Dec 13, 1971.

However, Organick's book is often said to describe an earlier version of
the system, up to somewhere in the vicinity of 1968/1970 (
https://multicians.org/history.html, also message to the old Multicians
list at Yahoo! I'm not sure about the archives of that, so don't have a
link). I understand that Multics got much better after the move to the 6180
and DPS8/M; Organick's book describes GE 645 Multics only.
