I don't remember if this story has been told here before or not but I got
it from Steve a few months ago.  Ever wonder by the shell was symmetrical
with if and fi, case and esac, but then had do and done?  Reason was that
by the time Steve wrote the shell, Ken had written the od command and dug
in his heels and wouldn't change the name.
