     What was more frustrating to Sun users was that there WAS a compiler included in Sun OS,

     <br>&gt; At the times I referred to the lack of freely available AT&amp;T source code 
     <br>&gt; was extremely limiting in how people viewed the availability of such 
     <br>&gt; "add-on" tools for Unix -- including the C compiler!&nbsp; 
     <br>
     <br>This wasn't just an AT&amp;T thing, Sun and SGI and everyone charged for their 
     <br>C compiler.&nbsp; I sort of get it, writing a good compiler is up there with 
     <br>writing a good kernel in effort, not quite the same, but probably the 
     <br>2nd hardest thing to do.&nbsp; So the compiler people cost a lot, companies 
     <br>wanted to get that cost back. 
     <br>
     <br>It was stupid.&nbsp; Having a free compiler meant that more people would 
     <br>write apps for your platform.&nbsp; &nbsp;It should have been a loss leader. 
     <br>
     <br>&gt; &gt; For folks running binary only systems from Masscomp/Sun/DEC/HP/IBM and the 
     <br>&gt; &gt; like, it is possible it was different. 
     <br>&gt; 
     <br>&gt; It was _very_ different. 
     <br>&gt; 
     <br>&gt; If you weren't out in the trenches of end-user Unix-based systems at the 
     <br>&gt; time it may not have been as obvious as to just how restrictive it was 
     <br>&gt; to have proprietary fee-based licensing of such add-on software.&nbsp; Most 
     <br>&gt; end-users couldn't even pay their vendors for ditroff -- their vendors 
     <br>&gt; didn't want to have to license it from AT&amp;T, even when they had 
     <br>&gt; advocates inside the companies (e.g. I did some work supporting software 
     <br>&gt; for a couple such vendors and was never able to convince them).&nbsp; Some, 
     <br>&gt; as you mention, were all-in, but it wasn't until UNIX System V Release 4 
     <br>&gt; became more widely available that systems based on it were more likely 
     <br>&gt; to have ditroff, and sometimes (though much more rarely) the "new" dpost 
     <br>&gt; post-processor was also included.&nbsp; I don't know if there were different 
     <br>&gt; licensing terms for SysVr4 or not.&nbsp; Don't get me started on how hard it 
     <br>&gt; also was to get some end users to buy a C compiler too. 
     <br>
     <br>Yep, lived through this as well.&nbsp; I fought with Sun to make more stuff 
     <br>free for developers, it just didn't make sense to not do that but the 
     <br>powers that were didn't get it. 
     <br>
     <br>One thing that Sun did do, probably in spite of itself, was fund 
     <br>Michael Tiemann's work on C++.&nbsp; He worked out some deal that that 
     <br>work would be open source and he pretty much made GNU C++ work 
     <br>for some definition of work (C++ is a mess).
