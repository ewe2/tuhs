nvi does multiple horizontal windows too (I don’t use vim much to know if it can split windows vertically). The Rand editor allowed you to split any windows vertically or horizontally. [I didn’t “move” to vim as it did arbitrary undo/redo incompatibly with nvi. I had asked Moolenaar a long time ago if he would provide an option to enable the nvi undo/redo behavior but he wasn’t interested. As a touch-mistypist this is an important feature for me :-)]
