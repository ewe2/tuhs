I can't get the sim 2.3d to boot ultrix 3.1 or xenix or anyother boot tapes
in the uhs's archive. I have compiled the pdp11 emulator with gcc-3.4.6. I
am also interested in the OS Tim Berners-Lee used to write his first
browser. VMS on a VAX machine I have read. Is there anything like this in
the archive? A VAX emulator and VMS OS?

Bill
