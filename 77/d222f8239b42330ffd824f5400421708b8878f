There's nothing in the Unix v5 manual about bc and there's no code for
it either. If there's an older version I can't find it.

I have a version of Unix v6 that has a file called /usr/doc/bc that
describes bc at length and it mentions both Lorinda Cherry and Robert
Morris.

There's even a file called /usr/doc/bca which is titled "Appendix"
with even more info.

Bob's Calculator seems plausible enough.
