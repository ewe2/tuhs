Subject: [pups] Installing begemot
Message-ID: <xA2QmgAtclGBFwZa@falstaf.demon.co.uk>

Hi All,
Well I know it's been quiet for ages on this but hopefully someone is 
listening.

I've just started to put P11 on a new Linux box and am having problems 
building begemot.  It keeps blowing out when compiling panic.  Is there 
a more recent version or are there some obvious patches I can do.

Regards

Robin
