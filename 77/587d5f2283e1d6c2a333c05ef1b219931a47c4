Also used in VT240/241 terminals.

My collection have some marked DEC DC311/es (T-11 engineering samples).

I's a nice chip with a straightforward interface.  Anyone that knows 8085,
nsc800 would like interfacing t-11. Instruction set is base LSI11.

The KDF11-B (why are people putting the hyphens in all the wrong places?) is
the quad-height 11/23 with two SLU's and boot ROM.
