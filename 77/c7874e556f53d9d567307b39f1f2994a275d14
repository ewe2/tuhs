AoE: All the quality you'd expect from low end ATA drives couple with all
the reliability of low-end consumer grade ethernet. What could go wrong?

AoE really punted on all the reliability stuff, so if you have any kind of
congested network it's a total disaster. Plus, who doesn't want to access
storage via an arcane protocol designed so you could latch registers
effective, but not so you can encode requests so.

Sorry for the rant, but I've had to deal with too much low-end gear
recently and it makes me grumpy and AoE back in the early 2000's was a
total S***show of low-end, poor quality implementations....
