Subject: [TUHS] 2.11 pcc with ANSI?
In-Reply-To: <20170116181107.B08D7400D8@vsta.org>
Message-ID: <57d7c379b914dd1b23590d7e114bf9a970662e93@webmail.yaccman.com>

It's been done.  Anders Magnusson has done quite a bit to port pcc
and add both ANSI and selected GCC features.
He's at ragge at ludd.ltu.se
There is a newsgroup too:  pcc-list at ludd.ltu.se

As I recall, at one point he did a head-to-head with gcc.  pcc
produced 3% worse code and was 100x faster, I think, but that may just
be my faulty memory...

 It seems like an obvious project would be to adapt a newer pcc with
ANSI
 C support of some sort. Has this already been done? I'll take a look
 if not.

 Thanks,
 Andy Valencia
