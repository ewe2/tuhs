Wow, that's great! That means that you have the initial version. Possibly it
is V5 not V6 (according to Holmgren they started out on V5 and ported to V6).

All my leads for the 1975 version of this code base came up dry and I feared
it lost. I think this code base is an important milestone. For example, I
think it may contain the first version of 'mbufs'. It may also contain the
first (Unix) instance of a network "work queue", which also seems to have
been a common design element of early (Unix) TCP's.

I still have one pending lead on the 1978 version of this code base.

Yes, a 'history' file seems to have been common practice at BBN. The kernel
would have had many modifications:
- the 'ports' extension from Rand
- the 'await' extension by Jack Haverty
- an 1822-driver
- possibly, an Autodin II network driver
- possibly, shared memory extensions
It might even have some NCP code in it, and if so probably derived from the
above. Indeed, lot's of diff'ing ahead to figure out what changes belong
together.

There seem to have been two versions of the BBN modified kernel. One was done
for systems without separate I/D with stuff heavily trimmed (even kernel
messages were shortened to a few bytes to save space). The other may have
extended the V6 kernel to run in separate I and D spaces and was less
anemic.
