I'm doing an en-masse compile of the programs in the /32V/usr/src/cmd 
directory, little-by-little, bit-by-bit.

Some don't compile, some do.

I've also run the bigger utilities - in their separate directories - through 
make with Greg Lehey's little one-liner script from "Porting UNIX Software", 
pg 74:
make 2>&1 | tee -a Make.log 

and will gzip and email them to you if you like.
