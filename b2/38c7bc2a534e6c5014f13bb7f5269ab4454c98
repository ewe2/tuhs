The missing piece is some sort of framework for fractional, partial,
composite, or shared ownership.  The performing arts folks have a notion of
this, but it is pretty specialized.

Our notion of ownership is all or nothing, strictly binary.

Publishing has notions of dividing rights regionally and by medium ("movie
rights" is a recognized term) but not really a composite view.

Movies have some stuff, but every movie is represented by its own
ton-of-paper contract.  No real general ideas.
