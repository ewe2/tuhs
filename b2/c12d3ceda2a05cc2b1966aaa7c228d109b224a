I cannot speak for the US, but ATM was rather popular in the European 
telecommunication in the mid 1990s.

I was e.g. in a EU research project, where I wrote IP-Multicast enhancements 
for the FORE ATM driver to support video multicast. From what I know, there may
still have been ATM in the core network of German Telekom when they started 
their IP-TV offer that is based on IP-multicast.

So people tried to work around the problems in ATM for a while until ATM was 
given up.
