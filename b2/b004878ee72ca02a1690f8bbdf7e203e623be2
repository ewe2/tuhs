Thanks to everyone who replied with tarballs, zip files, pointers to
stuff in the archive, web links ...  I will try (eventually) to thank
everyone individually as well, but in the meantime please accept this
broadcast. :-)

This has now become Yet Another Back Burner Project; I hope putting things
together into a reasonable github repo (or two) will happen without
too much of a delay.

This is a great group of people!

Thanks,

Arnold
