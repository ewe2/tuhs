I have done it with

	dd if=/dev/zero of=newdisk.dsk bs=1k count=10240

to make 10MB RL02 images.  Followed by the lightly-documented
step in the Supnik emulator of attaching the disk image and writing
the badblock table.  Followed by (for RT11) INIT/NOQ DL1

Corresponding for a Unix system would be mkfs(8) or newfs(8),
whichever you have.

I think it is only the RL disks that need the badblock step.

Ken, if this image isn't already in the archive, can you send it in?

Thanks,

Dear All,
I have a Dilog TS11 controller but no TSV05 or TS11 drive.  Has anyone got such
a thing in the UK that they would be willing to part with, sell, swap or
whatever.  Ideally I would like one of the Dilog 880 drives with the
free-standing, i.e., not rack mounting, cabinet.

Regards

Robin
