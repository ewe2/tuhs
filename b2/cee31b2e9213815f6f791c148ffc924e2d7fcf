I thought I only made one point, and that was that the argument for V6
being easier to port because "286 protected mode gives a very similar
handling on memory management as the PDP did".

Since V6 and V7 both run on the PDP-11 it can absolutely not be an
argument for preferring V6 to V7.

Thus I think it is a silly argument.

The rest is purely speculative on my behalf, and I really don't want to
debate wether V6 or V7 would be better to port.
I have a proper PDP-11 at home, and in addition, I run RSX, not Unix on
it. :-)
