Subject: [TUHS] Audio of Maike Mahoney's oral history interviews?
Message-ID: <20110705004601.GA17949@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, several years back Mike Mahoney interviewed several of the original
Unix players for a Unix oral history. The transcripts are at:
http://www.princeton.edu/~hos/mike/transcripts/

At the time AT&T were going to release these in audio format, but it seems
to have fizzled out. Does anybody know if the audio interviews ever got out?
The transcripts are fine, but in places they show "(unclear)" when a word
or name is used, and of course it's exactly that name you want to find out.

Many thanks for any leads.
