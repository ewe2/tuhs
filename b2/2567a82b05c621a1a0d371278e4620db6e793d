Well, a CD-ROM *is* an ISO, so it doesn't need conversion beyond
dd'ing to some other format (note: CD-ROMs have a 2 kB block size, so
you'll need a bs=4b or larger for it to work at all).

Anyway, I think I have what you're looking for: "Sprite 1984-1993",
published by Walnut Creek CDROM.  I can make a copy for you (I'm
pretty sure there's no copyright issue, but I'll check what's on the
CD before making the copy).  But wouldn't it be easier just to
download the stuff off the net?
