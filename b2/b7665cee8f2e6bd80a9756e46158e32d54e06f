The timestamp for p.c in V8 is:

	May 30 06:56 1983

Do you have a link to verify that it has been created earlier?

p from UNOS was written by Jeff Goldberg in 1981 or 1982.

Well, in practice people managed this problem nicely.
The annoying name clashes I am aware of are less than 20 years old.

Well, if Rob's p existed before and was available as OSS.....

The background for UNOS in it's first glance was that Jeff Goldberg wanted to 
rewrite UNIX from scratch in less than a year. I believe, he did a pretty good
job.

BTW: UNOS has been sold to real customers from it's beginning. Was UNIX V8 
available outside AT&T?
