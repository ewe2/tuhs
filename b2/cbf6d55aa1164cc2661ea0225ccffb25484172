If you run 'strings f2', you get:

File 1:
        2 copies of magtape bootstrap (2 blocks total)
        The standalone bootstrap
File 2:
        A file to console copy program
File 3:
        This file
File 4:
        The program mkfs
File 5:
        The program restor
File 6:
        A dump of rp0
File 7:
        A dump of rp3

The numbering starts at 0 of course, so that tm(0,3)
is indeed a standalone mkfs.
