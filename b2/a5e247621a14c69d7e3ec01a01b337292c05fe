Carl Lowenstein:

  I suppose the easiest break-in tool would be a floppy disk with a bootable
  RT11 on it.

Or, if your goal is just to drain the machine's brain entirely
and start over, which is likely the case if you want to put 2.11
on it: dig up the standalone disk diagnostic (is XXDP easily
available somewhere these days?) and reformat the disk.
