Screen => console tty is obvious.  But why do you insist on the floppy
drive as the storage medium?

The floppy drive subsystem has drives and a controller with a certain
programatic interface.  The IDE/SCSI subsystem has drives and a controller
with a certain programatic interface.  They're the same kind of thing.
Why is one more guilty of evolving the 1970s version of UNXI?

I think that a floppy might make a good RK03/05 (capacity differences
aside), but why not implement some RP drives with hard drives of even zip
drives?
