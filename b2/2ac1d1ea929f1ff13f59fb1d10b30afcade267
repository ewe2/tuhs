On the other hand, you have to grok only one line of code
instead reading pages of Java/C++ with surprises lurking
everywhere :-)

Since you need one line to do the work of many many lines of
c++/Java code, you should expect to spend more time on that
one line!

The same is true with shell one liners as well. We don't
(usually) consider constructs such as the following "clever"
because we expect its reader to have a certain level of code
literacy and context (or an ability to gain such).

tr -cs A-Za-z '\n' | tr A-Z a-z | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | sed ${1}q
