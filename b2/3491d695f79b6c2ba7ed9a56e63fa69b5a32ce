This is good. You can also get the straight text of the source
without the line numbers by just removing the .html suffix of the
the file (e.g try http://www.tom-yam.or.jp/2238/src/lp.c)
I cannot read Japanese so I don't know if it says how it
was produced or it's origin. But I can tell that it is not a
derivative of the PDF I produced.
