Largely agree; though the complexity battle has long been lost. On =

maintain these systems!

I have used ZFS since 2005 and largely happy with it. Replaced all the =
disks twice. Moved the same set of disks to a new machine. etc. =

checksummed blocks, redundancy etc. The dedup impl. is suboptimal so I =
don't use it. No idea if they considered using a bloom filter and a =
cache to reduce memory use. If a new FS came along with a similar set of =
features and a simpler, better integrated implementation, I'd switch.
