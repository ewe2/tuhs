Probably depends on the implementation.  VAX-FORTRAN passed by
reference (but not on the stack).

Off-topic: I recall a working function that crashed when fed a
constant string.  Spelunking revealed that someone had replaced a
letter-by-letter case-insensitive comparison with a "faster version"
(written in VAX assembler, no less) that converted both arguments to
upper case and then block-compared.
