I kind of disagree about the CL reader in the context of CL, but strongly agree that such a thing would be a mistake for a C-family language.  but yes, #+ & #- are what I'd like for a C-family language.

As you say statement languages make this a bit harder: I've never understood why anyone thought they were a good idea (I think a C-level expression-language ought to be reasonably easy to do).
