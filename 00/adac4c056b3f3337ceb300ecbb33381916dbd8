I am a bona fide BSD user, running 4.3BSD Quasijarus0c on my copy of the SIMH 
VAX.  (Mind you - just to set the cat amongst the pigeons - running on my 
Linux box ... :-)

Thanks to everybody for all your help.  It's been greatly appreciated.

You ask, "What is the most important thing?"
Maku e ki, "He tangata, he tangata, he tangata."
I reply, "It is people, it is people, it is people."
