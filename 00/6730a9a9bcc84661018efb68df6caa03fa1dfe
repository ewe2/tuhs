Subject: [TUHS] the sin of buffering [offshoot of excise process from a
	pipeline]
Message-ID: <201407150231.s6F2VRK0022875@coolidge.cs.dartmouth.edu>

> Err, why is buffering data in the process a sin? (Or was this just a
humourous aside?)

Process A spawns process B, which reads stdin with buffering. B gets
all it deserves from stdin and exits. What's left in the buffer,
intehded for A, is lost. Sinful.
