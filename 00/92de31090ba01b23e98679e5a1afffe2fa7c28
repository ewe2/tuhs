I did! I spent many pleasant hours developing gawk and its documentation
on mine. There was a separate USENET network of 7300 and 3B1 owners (unixpc.*
heirarchy) which I was on.

With the Telebit modems, things moved REALLY fast.

Comp.sys.3b1 is still alive and occasionally sees activity.

Ah, the nostalgia... :-)
