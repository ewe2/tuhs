Hi Ian,

I'd strongly encourage you to reach out to Linode support (I've found 
them very responsive and helpful) and ask about BSD.

I believe you can do a micro install of something on one vDisk and then 
use that to boot strap install something else, possibly anything else.

I think I've even heard that you could get Windows installed via their 
GUI web console.  -  So I expect that BSD should be fairly easy to do.

I personally am planing on resizing a couple of VMs to a larger size w/ 
more CPU & disk to do a Gentoo install from my old CentOS.  Then I'll 
switch the boot disk, and ultimately remove CentOS & shrink back to the 
current size.

So, don't give up on Linode yet.  I bet you that they have a way for you 
to run BSD.

Agreed.  }:-)
