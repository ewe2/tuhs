Maybe since you have a number of these you want to apply, check with a grep
for the expected marker before you try to apply the sed script and only do
it in a more automated matter catching the vast majority of the markers.]

You asked how we did it.  As was said, there were a number of unshar(1)
commands out there, that did the sed for you.   Go looking in the archives,
but generally speaking using vi was 'good enough' for day to day work
because you did not run it that often / every day / were >>usually<< not
apply a lot of them in a row.
