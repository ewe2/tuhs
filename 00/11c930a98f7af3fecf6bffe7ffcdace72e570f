Subject: SGI Software Usability II (IRIX 5.1 memo)
Message-ID: <20171012130443.2s7xnhughyj5667s@saucer.turnde.net>

Hi,

I came across this on Lobsters[1] today and thought it may be of interest 
to the list: 
http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/unix-haters/tirix/embarrassing-memo.html

It appears to be an internal SGI memo that's rather critical of IRIX 5.1.  
Does anyone know if it's true?
