FWIW, I don't know about the tape error, but that layout looks OK apart
from the fact that if it's an 11/83, the memory shold be in the first slot
and the CPU in the second.  The essential difference between an 11/73 and
an 11/83 is that the 11/83 uses PMI memory.  Assuming your backplane is the
right one, in a BA23 or BA123 box, and that your memory is a single 4MB
board, you should swap them round, otherwise what you actually have is an
11/73.

I assume your RD54 controller is a genuine DEC RQDX3, so it's in the right
place.  It's possible you have an old version of the firmware on it, but it
should still work even if you do.

There normally isn't an extra terminator in an 11/73 or 11/83, unless you
add an expansion backplane.
