Our CS department had a mainframe as well, also a handful of 11/750s and
11/780s.  The compiler class was taught on the mainframe, the prof had
a lex/yacc clone he had written and wanted us to use that.

My buddy Rob Netzer and I had 3B1 (Unix PC) or maybe 2, I think I had
one as well, and we asked the prof if we could do the class on those.
Rob had to write the lex/yacc clone to be compat with the profs, he
did and we happily avoided using the mainframe.  We were very sold
on Unix by then.
