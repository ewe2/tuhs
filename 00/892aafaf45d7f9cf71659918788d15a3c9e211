All, I've got the TUHS and PUPS mailing lists working, but only via http:

	http://minnie.tuhs.org/mailman/listinfo/tuhs
	http://minnie.tuhs.org/mailman/listinfo/pups

I'm sharing a colo box with a number of virtual hosts, so I need to
work out how to add the tuhs.org domains to the SSL certificate with
subjectAltName. Working on it ....

Cheers,
	Warren
