A lot of original UNIX code was simple, but we ended up with 272 lines of
bloat in echo.c[1].  That bloat started to creep in already in the
beginning
when Rob Pike formulated his famous presentation on cat(1)[2].  I also
think that sockets implementation was the turning point.

Plan 9 was probably the last truly dedicated effort to keep it simple using
the UNIX way of doing things.  I much prefer reading its code than GNU
or FreeBSD.  I think the world really needs a Unix operating system which
is as simple and elegant as Plan 9.
