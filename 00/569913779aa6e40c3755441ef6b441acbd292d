Hi all. First up, it's TUHS so please no DKIM/email chatter here. Only a
few of you are involved and it's not relevant to Unix history.

Grant Taylor and Tom Ivar Helbekkmo having been working behind the scenes to
find a good solution. We are hoping to a) merge the two lists back together,
b) reinstate [TUHS] and non-mangled From: lines, and c) keep most MTAs
happy in the process.

With some luck, all of this will be resolved. So, let's get back to the
discussion of old Unix systems :)

Thanks, Warren
