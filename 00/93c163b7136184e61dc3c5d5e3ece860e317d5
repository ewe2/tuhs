Subject: [TUHS] PDP11/23 and microPDP (11/23?)
Message-ID: <20060515070555.GB11843@freaknet.org>


Hi,

in the end of May i'm going to recover a PDP11/23, a
MicroPDP11/23 (maybe? i've not seen it) and some other stuff for
our computer museum. 

Does someone have an idea about what flavour of Unix can be run,
if this is possible, on 11/23? :)

greets from sicilia, italy!
