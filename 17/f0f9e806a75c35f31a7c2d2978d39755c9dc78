My memory is hazy, I seem to remember there was one more heavy weight mail
system after MMDF for UNIX that came from the Brits in the 1980s/early 90s
in the same vein who's name I can not think of. =E2=80=8B  That must have b=
een PMDF
now that I think about it.    Simon Rosenthal was one of guys involved in
it.  He did the support for what it was for us at LCC.  Thinking about it,
we must have been running that version at Locus before I went to DEC.  If I
can find Simon or the other Andy Tannenbaum (trb), I'll ask them if either
of them remembers.  But I can say the date has to be wrong on this quote
you mention.  I would think the translation from Pascal back to C would
have been 10 year earlier and that would make more sense.   By 1999, I had
left LCC.    As I said, Simon would be a good person to ask if I can dig
him up.
