I think you did say just that.  I was trying to make a more general
point for everyone on the list, not you in particular: not to assume
that the code snapshots we have correspond in any detailed way to the

[R]eversing the apostolic precept to be all things to all men, I usually [before
Darwin] defended the tenability of the received doctrines, when I had to do
with the [evolution]ists; and stood up for the possibility of [evolution] among
the orthodox --thereby, no doubt, increasing an already current, but quite
undeserved, reputation for needless combativeness.  --T. H. Huxley
