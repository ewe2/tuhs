Perhaps also worthy of a mention is Network Registration Service (NRS)
used in the UK academic network (JANET). Similar idea to
HOSTS.TXT. Periodic download and munge.

More interestingly though, NRS used the opposite ordering to DNS, so
"cs.nott.ac.uk" was "uk.ac.nott.cs", which became a problem when
Czechoslovakia got their TLD (.cs) in the 80s as the both DNS and NRS
were used in parallel for some period of time.

I believe NRS was still being used to some capacity by the time
Czechoslovakia split in 93.
