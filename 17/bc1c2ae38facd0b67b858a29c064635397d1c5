The C compiler for Windows NT on Alpha was a hybrid--the front end was
the basically unmodified from Visual C++, and the code generator was
the GEM back end that all of DEC's compilers for Alpha used.  There
was an intermediate language translator that converted the output from
the VC++ front end to GEM IL.  DEC's GEM team had no access to the
VC++ front end source code--we worked from the Microsoft IL
specification.  A lot of the early instability of the Alpha NT C
compiler was due to cases where the IL spec was vague, or where things
didn't work quite as advertised.  Technically, it was an interesting
project to work on (sometimes in the old Chinese curse sense of
"interesting").
