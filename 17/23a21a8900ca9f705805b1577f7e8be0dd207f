Hi,

There's a unix "awesome list". It mentions TUHS's wiki, as well as this quote:

"This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do
it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle
text streams, because that is a universal interface." - Douglas
McIlroy, former head of Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center
