Yes, absolutely.  I worked in the kernel group in building 5.  That was
pretty much the best group of people I have been a part of.  That team
could have done anything, SMP was not a problem for them.  They for sure
could have made SunOS scale.  The people who didn't leave were the people
who made Solaris work.

That said, I have to give credit to the group of people I built who
did BitKeeper.  I'd stand them up against the Sun kernel team and they
would win.  Smaller group, stellar bunch of people.

I'm happy that I got to be part of both teams.
