Guilty as charged.

My understanding, which is borne out by the Wikipedia article, is that
only parts of ENIAC are on display at the Smithsonian.  It lists a
number of other places with parts.

But then there's yet another computer, the Zuse Z4 at the Deutsches
Museum in MÃ¼nchen.  Again from Wikipedia, it was built between 1942
and 1945, and thus predates ENIAC.  It seems that it's complete, but
of course it's not electronic.  So until proof of the contrary, CSIRAC
is the oldest surviving complete electronic computer.

Do I need more adjectives?
