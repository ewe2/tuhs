Hello from Gregg C Levine
True. But they are giving away the latest version of their OS for
free. I have it here, both X86, and SPARC versions. In fact I got both
of them at the previous LWE event here in the US, in NYC. The
individual first gave me the SPARC version, and then realized I had
asked for the X86 version, and handed me that version.
