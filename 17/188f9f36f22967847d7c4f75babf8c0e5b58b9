Mahlzeit



My name is Matthias Bruestle and I'm new on this mailing list.
I'm collecting old computers and have until now 34.

I have a 11/34A with 128kB RAM, DL11-W and 2 RL01. I want to
install UNIX on her. Because there are no RL01 disk images
which I can use directly, I want to prepare one with a
PDP-11 emulator. I got V6 to boot with the Supnik emulator,
but noticed than that V6 has no support for RL01 drives.
Does someone have RL01 drivers for V6 or must I use V7?

The last step would be to download the image over the serial
line. Is there allready a programm for RT-11SJ V4.00
which does this?



Thanks for your help

Matthias, I'm pretty sure that the v6 RL driver supports RL01s and RL02s,
the only difference is number of sectors on the RL01.

If you have an RL02 disk image mounted on /dev/rl0, and an empty
RL01-sized disk image mounted on /dev/rl1, you should be able to
say:

	$ mkfs /dev/rl1 <size of RL01 in 512-byte blocks>
	$ mount /dev/rl1 /mnt

You can then copy over the root files from /dev/rl0 to /dev/rl1 with tar.

One thing to note, the RL02 kernel comes with swap at the end of the
RL02. You will need to rebuild a kernel so that the location and size of the
swap will fit onto a RL01 and still leave some file space. In fact, you must
remember to subtract the swap space size when you do the mkfs.

Best to do this on the emulator and get the RL01 image ready before
moving it to the /34. I also forgot to mention that you need to install
the bootstrap code onto the RL01 image. Check the mkfs man page for details.

Someone did say they have a program to do this. You might want to look
back through the mail archives on the PUPS web page.

	V6 predates the RL02 by enough time that I doubt V6 has RL0? support
	unless someone managed to graft it on after ~1979 (by which time V7
	was out).

	V7 _initially_ did *not* have RL02 support.  When we got our first V7

	unless someone added the RL0? support to V7 and submitted the updated
	images to the archives it's doubtful RL devices can be used with V7.

	2.9BSD came with the necessary drivers because that system came a couple
	years later than V7 and the folks at UCB had had time to write the
	drivers and boot support.

The V7 are RL02 images and include the RL drivers.

rl1conf:

rl
root rl 0
swap rl 0
swplo 9000
nswap 1240
tm

I assume that means that the filesystem ist 9000 block long and the
swap 1240 blocks. (-> mkfs /dev/rl1 9000)

Until now I have the RL02 cleaned up, so it fits on a RL01, and
made a filesystem on the RL01. Now I'm fighting with the emu.

My V7 has RL drivers, and AFAIR they're on my distribution tape, which has
a 1980 date sticker on it (I think; it's not to hand).

My 11/23 only has RL02s on it, and it was running V7 fine this morning :-)

OK. Now I have a RL01 image, which boots at least on the emu with
the original rl1unix kernel.

# mkfs /dev/rl1 9000
# dd if=/usr/mdec/rluboot of=/dev/rl1 count=1
# mount /dev/rl1 /mnt
# df
# rm -rf /usr/dicts /usr/src /usr/games /rkunix /usr/spool/uucppublic/ansi*
# tar cf - .profile bin boot etc lib tmp usr | (cd mnt; tar xf -)
# cp /rl1unix /mnt/unix
# mkdir /mnt/mnt
# mkdir /mnt/dev
# cp /dev/makefile /mnt/dev
# cd /mnt/dev
# make
# make rl
# ln rl0 swap
# cd /usr/sys/conf
# cp rl1conf conf
conf: remove last line (tm)
m.h: uncomment "#define _1134"
makefile: M = smch
copied pk.p, stat.h and tty.h from other V7 source to /usr/sys/h
# make unix
# cp unix /mnt/nunix

The selfmade kernel nunix doesn't boot. Did I something wrong?

Should I adjust also other options in m.h or param.h to get better
performance with 128kByte (not kWord) RAM?

All,
	I accidentally shut down the PDP Unix ftp archive on
henry.cs.adfa.oz.au yesterday, as it's my desktop PC and I temporarily
forgot about its other uses. It should be back on again at 0000 GMT Monday.

I've also got a new Pentium to replace the 486 which is henry, and I will
cut over to the new machine sometime in the next two weeks, so if you are
having any troubles ftp'ing stuff from this machine, please let me know.

Cheers,
	Warren
