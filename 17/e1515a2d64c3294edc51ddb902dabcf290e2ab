There was a time when, by default, vim started in 'compatible' mode, in
which u didn't ignore u, so you got the toggle-style undo.  Compatible
mode also keeps the ol$ style of c representation, and so forth.  You
can still force this by making a ~/.vimrc file that just contains

set compatible

I don't remember when vim stopped launching in compatible mode by
default, but that was basically when I stopped using it.  I only figured
out how to force it back because it's on all the linux computers I run
into at work.

As I recall, the 'set compatible' command is shorthand to set all the
vi-compatibility flags by default; it is possible to set them
individually as well.  So your proposal is (was?) at least implemented,
if not in a very useful manner.
