​Amen...   it was rarely useful.   I always found realloc to one of the
part I could never trust.  I do remember  what you got back from any of the
malloc calls could vary widely.  Particularly pre-ANSI C and working on
non-UNIX systems.


Malloc in general was always a tarbaby because there were (are) so many
implementations "in the wild."   I used to advise our application people to
create something that was application specific and then call the local
malloc under the covers, but the chances that a general malloc
implementation would be optimal for your code was low.​
