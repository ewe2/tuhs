If you mean in PDP-11 C, you're right, char is signed precisely because
MOVB sign extends.  In C in general, char's signedness is undefined.
Similarly the signedness of a bitfield is undefined, which means that
the portable range of a 1-bit field is just 0, though there is another
value that might be +1 or -1.
