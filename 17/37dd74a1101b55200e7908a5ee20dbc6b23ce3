I think EIS is similar in function but not the same.

We need the KE11A, which maps some registers into the unibus space.  It
performs some of the same functions as EIS, but in a different way - it
does not extend the instruction space like EIS does.

I may be wrong, but that is my understanding.  EIS is supported, as is
the FP instructions and CIS, but I can't find any code which pretends to
be a KE11A in simh.  It's definitely in apout.
