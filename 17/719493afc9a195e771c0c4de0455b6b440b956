It's a common misconception that -ize is US English.  The Oxford
English Dictionary, normally not prescriptive, prefers it.  See
https://www.oed.com/page/faqs/Frequently+asked+questions#spell.  I
personally had -ise drummed out of me by my uncle, very much
Australian.

Yes, currently only FreeBSD has it.  But you have the sources.  Apart
=66rom option handling, it's only:

--- print.c     (.../head/bin/ls/print.c)       (revision 241014)
+++ print.c     (.../stable/10/bin/ls/print.c)  (working copy)

                (void)printf("%*s ", (u_int)width, buf);
+       } else if (f_thousands) {               /* with commas */

+               (void)printf(format, (u_int)width, bytes);
        } else
                (void)printf("%*jd ", (u_int)width, bytes);
 }

A quick and dirty fix would be simply to replace the format string.
