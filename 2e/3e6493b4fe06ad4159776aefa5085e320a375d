​Ah Noel - Thanks for the refresher course.   That's right.  I now remember
it.  I knew it was compiled into the kernel but I had forgotten the details.

It was not until much later that the swap image became less screwed
down/more reflexible.   You first needed to get to larger disks (rp05/rp06)
which had to be partitioned because they overflowed a 16 bit integer​.
Once people started to partition them, then all sort of new things occurred
and I that's when the idea of a dedicated swap partition came up.   I've
forgotten if that was a BSDism or UNIX/TS.   Certainly by the time of Sam's
4.1A?? configuration tool that created conf.c and low.s it had already been
in for a while.

As I recall in V6 and I think V7, the process was first placed in the swap
image before the exec (or at least space reserved for it).   So you had to
have a swap space to boot because to fork the "init" it needed to assigned
to the swap space (chick/egg issue). When demand support was added to the
kernel, the process did not have to have that requirement, so it meant swap
set up could be a post initial program load operation for the start
sequence.
