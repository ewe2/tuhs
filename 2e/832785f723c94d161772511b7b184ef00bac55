Hi All.

I am starting to collect, if possible, different versions of the QED
editor; with a hope to put up a git repo.

If you have a tarball of code, please send it to me with as much info
about it as you have.  I would like to track down the qedbuf(1) man page
also.

I have contacted Rob Pike and got one tarball from him. I have another
tarball that I got sometime in 1987 and have a promise of code coming
Donald Mitchell.

Much thanks!

Arnold
