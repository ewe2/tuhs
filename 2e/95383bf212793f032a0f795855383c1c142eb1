I still actively fight office. I wrote docx2troff and xlsx2txt.

The former can extract txt or troff source from modern (DOCX / OPC) document
as can the latter though, by their nature excel tables don't map well to tbl(1).

These are written for plan9 and so the libraries are a bit different,
but they could be ported to unix without too much pain.

Shout if anyone is interested.
