I tried the same with a few of the utilities and a make with the kernel files.

<shock and awe>Dependencies again</shock and awe> - with most of the utilities 
the compile was easy, since their dependencies were easily filled by the 
standard Linux C libraries.  Since many of the kernel dependencies depend on 
the vax specific .s files and I don't know anything about the vax at the 
moment, I decided to leave it until I _did_ know.  That's why I've been 
asking stoopid questions on this list.

Well, if you're keen on it, I am too.  I need something to do over the 
holidays.
