I still run qmail, using a patch to pass everything through
SpamAssassin.  Remote IMAP is provided by courier-imap.  This setup has
been in place long enough that I can no longer remember originally
configuring it.

I experimented with moving to OpenSMTPD, but at the time it wasn't
flexible enough to manage spam filtering in a sane way.  I've read
matters have improved, and based on current descriptions it might be
worth revisiting.

Another relative newcomer is rspamd, which can take a lot of the pain
out of spam filtering.  Getting it integrated with my creaky old qmail
setup has been on my TODO for quite a while now.

Sadly, while my setup has been rock-solid and I have no complaints,
there's nothing plug and chug about it.  The ability to quickly deploy a
new server is one of the things that originally got me looking at
OpenSMTPD, but filtering and user-controlled address creation a la
.qmail-files were showstoppers for me.
