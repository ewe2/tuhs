Hello!
Adam? Seriously? That was the case when I visited them at one year's
LinuxWorld. (I think it was the one when we met.) And yes at the
System Z Council meetings I would catch up with them.

Larry? It is funny, but earlier on I did mention all of that in a
completely different thread.

But why would the <DELETED!> characters at what was SCO start this
stupidity all over again? I seem to be missing something.
