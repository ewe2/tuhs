Subject: [TUHS] The evolution of Unix facilities and architecture
Message-ID: <583620cb-6856-b9ee-a5ee-32885c09362b@aueb.gr>

I've made available on GitHub a series of tables showing the evolution 
of Unix facilities (as documented in the man pages) over the system's 
lifetime [1] and two diagrams where I attempted to draw the 
corresponding architecture [2].  I've also documented the process in a 
short blog post [3].  I'd welcome any suggestions for corrections and 
improvements you may have, particularly for the architecture diagrams.
