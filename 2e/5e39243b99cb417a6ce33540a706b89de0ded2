Does ersatz-UNIX count?

At one start-up, our servers were SPARC-based but we could only afford
Intel boxes on the desktops.  We found that the MKS Toolkit on OS/2
Warp was the closest on the boxes, talking to the servers over X and
such.  (EMX stuff was acceptable but it still sat on top of DOS.  Warp
was odd in that it came with a full TCP/IP stack.)
