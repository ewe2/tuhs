SCO is still around in some form.  I believe it=E2=80=99s mostly just a sup=
port
offering.  They converged on two products in the =E2=80=9890s:  OpenServer =
(SVR3)
and UnixWare (SVR4).  It seems like most people preferred or were stuck on
OpenServer while UnixWare would have eventually been a nicer system but I
don=E2=80=99t know first hand.  They also shipped a version of FreeBSD 10
commercially a handful of years ago.
