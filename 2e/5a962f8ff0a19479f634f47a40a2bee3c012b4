Yea, that's the main benefit of extra flags to commands: you can optimize
the number of filters that data passes through, or you can do things with
'hidden state' that's hard to do in another phase of the output. ls is a
good example. ls -lt is relatively easy to do the sorting of times and the
formatting of times inside ls, but harder to do as a filter since times are
hard to sort...
