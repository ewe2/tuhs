Just so.

We were generally aware of each other's work. My papers on drawing
lines, circles, and ellipses on rasters, though, were barely connected
to troff. Troff did not contain any drawing algorithms. That work was
relegated to the rendering programs that interpreted ditroff output.
Thus publication-quality rendering with support for thick lines was
outsourced to Adobe and Mergenthaler.

Various PostScript or ditroff postprocessors for screen-based
terminals were written in house. These programs paid little or no
attention to fonts and line widths. But the blit renderers made a
tenuous connection between my ellipse algorithm and troff, since my
work on the topic was stimulated by Rob's need for an ellipse
generator.
