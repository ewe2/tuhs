I agree with that. To write a story or an article, you have to know where you are going with it. You need 
to know how to make the best use of your resources - the language, the register of language eg chatty 
versus formal versus jargon versus whatever - which implies you have to know those resources, you 
need to know how everything fits together in their contexts unless you are writing satire or comedy or 
such in which case you are deliberately aiming for the resulting absurdity. Etc, etc.

And you don't get that from being told about it. You have to do it. And you have to revise it. And you 
have to be humble about it, too. Taking criticism on board in on of the hardest things from any writer.

But that's how it works.
