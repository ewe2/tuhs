Except from 1993-1996 there were only two of those BSDs. NetBSD and FreeBSD
forked in 1993 due to the inability of the patchkit to adequately cover the
problems
in 386BSD governance. OpenBSD didn't fork until late 1995 or early 1996
depending
on when you count such things (Theo's firey email, or the first release).
Drangonfly BSD
didn't fork until a decade later in 2004 due to a dispute in how to make
FreeBSD's
kernel SMP. And 386BSD stopped being a thing in 1993 when Jolitz disappeared
from public view and NetBSD/FreeBSD filled the free vacuum that created and
BSDi with BSD/386 filled the commercial space.

Except there never really was only one kernel. There have been hundreds
of forks of the Linux kernel over the years. Most of them have been
commercial
of some flavor (Redhat, Debian, OpenSUSE, MontaVista, WindRiver, Android
etc)
had hundreds or thousands of patches on the base Linux kernel for a long
time
and trying to move from one to another if you also had patches was a
nightmare.

Kernel.org has kept going, and many of the chanages from these systems were
lost.
Some were not as good as what came in upstream, while others were encumbered
by commercial contracts that made them unappealing to upstream. True, many
of
them did wind up in kernel.org, but to say there aren't forks in Linux is
stretching
reality a bit...

I think Linux's greatest strengths were the different distributions, though
at times it causes a great deal of duplicated effort. They allowed
different communities
the room to customize things in an easy way. I believe that, more than one
kernel,
has been a driver of innovation.

But honestly, the litigation was a deal killer for many BSD users in the
early days,
and that gave Linux room to grow. Had the BSDs not faced the competition
from Linux
and had similar resources poured into them, the NetBSD/FreeBSD split would
have
been good competition, much as there's good competition between Debian,
Redhat, Suse,
Canonical, etc today in the Linux space which helps to drive innovation.

Even today, with the benefit of hindsight, it's hard to pin which of these
facts on
the ground was the biggest driver for most people...
