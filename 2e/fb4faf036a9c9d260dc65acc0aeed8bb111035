Novells claims are not very credible....

I mentioned that the USL laboratories from AT&T (including the people who work 
there) have been handed over from AT&T to Novell and later to SCO.

It is most unlikely that these people did not terminate their contract in case 
the ownership of the code has not been transfered to the respective new owner 
of the company.
