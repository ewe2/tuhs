The name seems obvious because I've seen it for the last 30 years. But I've
not seen it used elsewhere, nor have I seen it documented except in
relationship to Unix. It could have been called blkio or bufio or bio or
even just work or morework and still been as meaningful. VMS uses the FDT
table to process the IRPs sent down. RT-11 has a series of entry points
that have boring names. Other systems have a start routine (though more
often that is a common routine used by both the queue me and isr
functions). There is a wide diversity here...
