And even to non-interactive operating systems.  Inspired by systat and
sysdpy on TOPS-10, I implemented similar functionality for DOS/VS on
the IBM System/370.  It did a continuously updating display of what
each partition was doing on a 3277 transaction terminal.  Very useful
for the system operator.  OS/VS1 had a similar utility.
