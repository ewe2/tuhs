Yeah, saw it.  I'm of the opinion that you aren't really truly an OS
person unless you've written a context switcher.  I wrote one for a
user level threading package I did for Udi Manber as a grad student.
I did most of the work in C and then dropped to assembler for the
trampoline.

It's really not that complicated, I think people make it out to be
a bigger deal than it is.  You're saving state (registers), switching
stacks, and changing the return address so you return in the new 
process.

Well, not that complicated on a simple machine line a VAX or a 68K
or a PDP11.  I sort of stopped playing in assembler when super scalar
out of order stuff came around and I couldn't get the mental picture 
of what was where.
