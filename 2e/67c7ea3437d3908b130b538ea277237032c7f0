Subject: [TUHS] Unix on a game boy
Message-ID: <20151227043042.GF31614@mcvoy.com>

I must be the only guy here who browses reddit (or I missed someone
else posting this).

This dude ported 5th edition to a game boy.  I'll admit my non coolness
by saying I don't know what a game boy is but I'm guessing it's some
video game thingy.
