I had a chance to try compiling a heavily-pthread'd queuing system I 
wrote, using VAX C on VMS 6.0+, actually running it on a VAXSTATION-3200.

I originally developed it on Sun Solaris, but with minimal compatibility 
issues, also ran on HP/UX, Linux, FreeBSD, etc.

It compiled on the VAX cleanly, needed some FIONBIO ioctl's (like 
FreeBSD) and ran suprisingly well for what it was. A 10Mbps NIC could 
only get so much data forced through it.

It could handle a few thousand threads before it became unusable, IIRC.

Good times.
