A/UX started out as a port of Unisoft SysV. Prior to version 2.0, there was
no Finder interface at all. A real history of the product should be done at
some point, as opposed to the half-baked opinions of someone who has only
seen a very late version of the product.

Since there were per-copy licensing fees to Unisoft, at least for the early
versions, it seems unlikely that a hobbyist license for A/UX would be possible.
