I think that the 3/50 was a "single board" VME system... and as you say
you really couldn't add anything to it.  I will pull one out and get
some close up shots of the connectors and perhaps the answer can be
determined by physical inspection.  I also looked at the config file for
NetBSD for the sun3 and it very much mentions vme all over the place,
but that may not have applied to the 3/50.  Is it possible that just VME
connector was used for power and the like... but nothing else??
