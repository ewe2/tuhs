The 36-bit PDP-10 initially used 7-track drives, with six frames to a
word.  During its lifetime sunset, 7-track drives were no longer made,
so 9-track drives were used instead.  The most common encoding was to
store a word in five 8-bit frames, with four bits unused.

The PDP-10 did not have a fixed byte size.  Were there any 9-bit
machines?
