It's in "df" as well, praise Cthulu:

     aneurin# df -h

(Memo to self: see where all the room has gone in /usr/local, as that's where I 
assigned the leftover space after the other partitions.)

No, I've never liked stuffing everything under the root file system as both the 
Mac and Penguin do; fill the root file system and you're hosed (and I also have 
an itch about /tmp being there as it's a world-writable directory).

Years ago I wrote a simple script "lss" which did the sort after being
howled down on one of the FreeBSD lists; what a surprise to see "-S"...

Heck, back in my UNSW days I suggested extending stty() to cover non-TTY 
devices and got trashed by the AGSM/ElecEng mob; well well, look at ioctl() 
when it appeared.
