Forgot to mention something on my site but I think I should bring it up
on the list anyway because I think it's a very neat hack
(by dmr, as scj told me):

B expects word addresses but the linker can't generate those on a byte
addressed machine. So all addresses have to be patched before calling
main at runtime. How can you do that if you link multiple files?
You will notice that the disassembled B files printn.s and printf.s
start with 'jmp 9f' and end with 'jsr r5,chain; 0'
Unfortunately we don't have the chain function but the way this
must work is the B runtime falls off into the first B object file,
which jumps to the end, calls a function to patch all addresses in
the current file, and falls off at the end itself into the next file.
The last file in the link has to be a B runtime file as well to end
the chain.

Note that this doesn't work with printn and printf because they're
inside bilib, but they have no addresses that need patching anyway,
guess you have to be careful.
