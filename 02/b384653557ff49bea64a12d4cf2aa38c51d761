Regarding Steve's photo from Summer USENIX, does anyone know who the shorter guy in a light jacket and polo shirt with a broad horizontal stripe on it, leaning right in front of me, elbow-to-elbow with Ron Natalie?

I had this odd query from a random a month or two ago about who he is, and I can't remember his name.
