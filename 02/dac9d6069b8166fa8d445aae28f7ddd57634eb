> Then one day a couple of them ‘fell off a truck’ and my Dad just happened to be there to pick them up and bring them home.

Wonderful story. It reminded me of the charming book, "five Finger Discount"
by Helene Stapinski, whose father brought home truckfall steaks.

Thanks for sharing the tale.
Doug
