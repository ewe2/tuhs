I've seen multiple people in this thread talk as if Usenet is gone / dead.

As an active Usenet user (daily) I wonder why people say that.  I still 
see a number of good conversations take place in newsgroups.

I also participate in newsgroups hosted on an open to the public but not 
peered news server daily.

I wonder how much of what is on the web could possibly benefit from a 
good web interface to a (potentially moderated) newsgroup.

Why re-invent storing and exchanging messages when NNTP works.  â€¦well in 
my opinion.

I just saw this happen on NANOG.  Someone asked about a group for DSL 
Network Operators and subsequently someone else mentioned that they just 
created a Facebook group, which got the obligatory "what about people 
that don't use Facebook" follow up.  Predictably there was yet another 
follow up indicating that it was the fault of people not using Facebook 
for not being able to access a public forum.

I am personally quite happy with (properly configured) mailing lists and 
newsgroups.
