Correct.  at was a v7-ism.   Trying to put a nicer face on the idea - that
is to say, I looked at the "at" command as a user-mode (command) front-end
to cron so you didn't have to edit the crontab yourself.  The later had
been around as a system support idea, since at least 6th edition - maybe
5th.
