Clem,

I think the "Algol machine" you have in mind is the RC-2000 (not quite sure
of the designation--could look it up in the attic if it matters) designed by
Per Brinch Hansen for Regencentralen (again, the name may not be quite right).
The manual used Algol as a hardware description language.  The instruction
set was not unusual. It has come up before in TUHS. I have the manual
if you need more info.

Doug
