I have always marveled at folks who can maintain multiple
versions of software, but Larry's dispatch from the
trenches reveals hurdles I hadn't imagined. Kudos for
keeping groff alive. 

Speaking of which, many thanks to all who pitched in
on the %% nit that I reported. The instant response
compares rather favorably to an open case I've been
following in gcc, which was originally filed in 2002.
