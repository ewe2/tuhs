Message-ID: <3AE8908F.BC5CBC79@fwn.rug.nl>

I was browsing through the 2.11BSD docs on my OpenBSD PC, and I noticed
I couldn't format the Pascal manuals.  Can anybody format them for me
in (if at all possible) PostScript format, or else plain TXT (with ^H_
and other more(1) hacks ofcourse)?  I haven't got 2.11 to work in simh
yet, otherwise I'd try it in 2.11.
