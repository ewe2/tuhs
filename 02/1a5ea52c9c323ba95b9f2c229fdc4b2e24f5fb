Another thing to think about, and that's only because I'm a 
dumpster-diver, is what's in the unallocated sectors? ;)

Not that I'm aware of. Things like NULs, and ^S can really ruin your 
day. Not to mention ^Z which a DOS copy might interpret as EOF. I only 
ever wrote programs to access the UART directly, but I remember my 
attempts at COPY or other DOS-specific ways of dealing with serial ports 
were never very successful. But that might have had more to do with 
buffer overruns (or in the case of the 8250 in the XT, a lack of a FIFO 
ala-16550 in the first place). Redirecting LPT1 to COM1 using MODE, I 
used to print to an LA100 using hardware handshaking.

Of course, but in some cases, a few $'s thrown at the problem is easier 
than messing around with something you don't want to mess around with ;)

I would be happy to contribute.
