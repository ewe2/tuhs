I don't have much experience with hardcopy terminals, but I did use the
WD-40 trick on dot-matrix printers in the 80s (Commodore MPS 803 was my
first printer).

Only time I used a hard-copy term was at my first job at a university
computer lab, our line printer went down, so, I dragged an LA120 out of
storage and hooked it up to serve as the printer until we could get the
line printer serviced.
