It most likely was Spider - it became operational in 1972. The vist =

"The current system contains just one loop with the switching computer =

four PDP-11/45 computers, two Honeywell 516 computers, two DDP 224 =
computers,
and one each of Honeywell 6070, PDP-8 and PDP-11/20. In fact many of =
these are

It would be interesting to know more about the H516=E2=80=99s and =
Spider, any other recollections?
