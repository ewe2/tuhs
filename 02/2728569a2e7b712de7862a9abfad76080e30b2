Sorry, the list is now running under mailman. You can go to


The files in Keith_Bostic_v7 are tape records directly from
the original 7th Edition distribution tape. The original details
on how to install such a tape are at:
http://minnie.tuhs.org/PUPS/Setup/v7_setup.html

file 0: block size 512: 16 records		boot loader
file 1: block size 512: 14 records		standalone cat program
file 2: block size 512: 1 records		README file
file 3: block size 512: 22 records		standalone mkfs program
file 4: block size 512: 22 records		standalone restor program
file 5: block size 10240: 202 records		dump of /
file 6: block size 10240: 937 records		dump of /usr

Probably the best way to extract the stuff from file 5 and file 6 would
be to package the whole thing up into a SIMH tar file, and follow the
boot instructions using a SIMH PDP-11 simulator. Or you could use a real
PDP-11.

If you only want the files, then Henry_Spencer_v7 has the same files.
