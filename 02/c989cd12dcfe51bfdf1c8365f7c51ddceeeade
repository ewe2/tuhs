I've done this, and now have an rf0.dsk which I can use to compare against
the output of my mkfs. I tried validating the image with V1 check:

	apout /usr/local/src/V1/bin/check rf0.dsk

Lots of inode errors, but at least check thinks there are files:

   . . .
5535 bad; i = 498i
5535 bad; i = 498i
  81 files
  81 large
 552 indirect
 552 used
 255 dup; i =   0f
 647 free
 343 missing

So things are progressing! I wish the docs were more informative as to
how to understand the output of check.

Cheers,
	Warren
