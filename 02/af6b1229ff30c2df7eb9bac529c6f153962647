Making tube (valve) machines reliable was something originally sorted out by=
 Tommy Flowers, who understood, and convinced people with some difficulty I t=
hink, that you could make a machine with one or two thousand valves (1,600 f=
or Mk 1, 2,400 for Mk 2) reliable enough to use, and then produced ten or el=
even Colossi from 1943 on which were used to great effect in.  So by the tim=
e of Whirlwind it was presumably well-understood that this was possible.

(This is not meant to detract from what Whirlwind did in any way.)
