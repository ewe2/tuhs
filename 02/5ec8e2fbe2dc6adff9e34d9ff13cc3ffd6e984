(other replies seen, nice to hear dmr=E2=80=99s confirmation)

Somewhat related.  My first =E2=80=9Creal=E2=80=9D job after university, =
and introduction to UNIX
et al, was using IBM machines running VM/370 and the CMS single-user OS =
for user
accounts.  CMS used long command names but, like some other OSes of its =
ilk, allowed
you to define what it called =E2=80=9Cabbreviations" via a count of the =
minimum number of
unique, leading, characters from which it could determine the actual =
command name.
The CMS file copy program was =E2=80=9Ccopyfile=E2=80=9D but the =
abbreviation length, at least at
our =E2=80=9Cshop", was 2 and everyone used =E2=80=9Cco=E2=80=9D.  =
Similarly the editor =E2=80=9Cxedit=E2=80=9D was =E2=80=9Cx=E2=80=9D.
I always found that amusing considering complaints about cryptic UNIX =
names.

(apologies if this appears twice, first attempt used the wrong From: =
address).
