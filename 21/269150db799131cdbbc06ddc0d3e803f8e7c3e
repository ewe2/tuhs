Wait, someone added logging to UFS?  Is there a writeup of that anywhere?
That would stomp all over my claim that nobody has hacked on UFS since
I did (which would be fine with me, I liked UFS, be cool if someone moved
it forward).

(pause while I google)

Yep, someone did.  I'd like to know who.  I found this:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/systems/linux/fs-performance-149840.pdf

Can anyone confirm those results?  That would be the first I've heard
of Solaris being faster than Linux.  If that's true has Linux tried 
to implement the same sort of logging?  

--lm

P.S.  I realize this isn't ancient Unix so I could move this to the 
linux-kernel mailing list.  Though maybe it is appropriate, it's tech
from the 1990's - is that ancient enough?
