Yea, I got the same thing when I tried compile it under OS X.  I know  
HPUX has it, so I checked the man page for longjmp under HPUX, and  
like OS X, it takes two parameters.  So, someplace, there is a version  
of the bs source that has the correct longjmp system call.   But, it  
may only be in the HPUX source tree.  I should boot up one of my SGI's  
and have a look to see if it has bs, and what version of longjmp it  
uses.
