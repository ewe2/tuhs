​So far that is true, there are a couple of leads including a couple of
unread tapes in my own basement.   The original authors and I have been in
touch.   Assuming we can find and recover it, there is still an open issue
of copyright.​

​Mumble ... it just means post-Joy sockets code does not 'just work.'  UNET
uses the Rand interface, which is similar to the interface MIT used for
Chaos and Chesson used for the ARPAnet code at UofI, so there are programs
that talk to it.   We had mail, ftp and telnet working just fine.​

​ Back in the day and IIRC we were playing with a port of the MIT SUPDUP
code but I do not remember if that ever worked on the small address
machines.​
