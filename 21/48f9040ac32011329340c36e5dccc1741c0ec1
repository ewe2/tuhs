Clem, I think I saw you say something similar in an earlier post.
To me it sounds as if you are saying that DEC did/designed PCI.
Are you sure about that? As far as I know, PCI was designed and created 
by Intel, and the first users were just plain PC machines.
Alpha did eventually also get PCI, but it was not where it started, and 
DEC had no control at all about PCI being public.

Might you have been thinking of Turbobus, Futurebus, or some other thing 
that DEC did? Or do you have some more information about DEC being the 
creator of PCI?

   Johnny
