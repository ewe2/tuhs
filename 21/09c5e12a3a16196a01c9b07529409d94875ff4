It is hard and you cannot do it from just reading the POSIX standard.

This is because the POSIX standard tries to write descriptions in an abstract 
notation that missleads people that did never see a working implementation 
before.

After a few years of maintaining the Bourne Shell, I would know how to do it but 
I am not interested to do it from scratch.
