Hi - Sorry for the delayed response.  It is here:

http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/4BSD/Distributions/4.2BSD/

You will need to download the "usr.tar.gz" archive, and extract these 
files from it:

games/lib/dungeon
games/lib/doverlay
games/lib/dtext.dat
games/lib/dindex.dat

The file "games/lib/compat" is the compatibility mode "stub", that can 
run a binary in PDP-11 compatibility mode, does system call emulation 
(it looks like, at one time, it even supported running RT-11 binaries), 
and stuff like that.  It actually uses the PDP-11 compatibility mode of 
the VAX (i.e., it is not a PDP-11 emulator), so it only works on VAXen 
that have compatibility mode.

Anyway, I suspect that if you take the binaries I've mentioned above, 
and drop them into your V7 filesystem under /usr (so that the files end 
up in /usr/games/lib), it may simply run.

Good luck!

--Pat.
