My sed-fu is only rudimentary but after  banging my head against
monitor a bit, I came up with this:

$  wc -l c.lisp 
90 c.lisp

$  cat c.lisp | sed -e '{=;}' | sed -e 'N;s/\n/ /'

Seems to print what is needed. Now, just embed it in sh script. A
program in C could be longer, and required a compiler.
