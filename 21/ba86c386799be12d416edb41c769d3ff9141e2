Sometimes one thing leads to another.

Following the recent mention of some retro-brew 68K single board =
systems, I decided to build a CB030 board (in progress). I figure it is =
a rough proxy for a 1980 VAX and would allow for some experimentation =
with the 32V / SysIII / 8th edition code.

My first thought was to use the M68K compiler that is included with the =
bit sources (see THUS Archive for this), as I had used that before to =
explore some of the Blit source. That compiler is LP32, not ILP32 - =
which may be a source of trouble. Just changing the SZINT parameter =
yielded some issues, so I started looking at the PCC source.

This source does not have a =E2=80=9Ctable.c=E2=80=9D in the well known =
format as described in the =E2=80=9CA tour of the portable C compiler=E2=80=
=9D paper. Instead it uses a file =E2=80=9Cstin=E2=80=9D which appears =
to be in a more compact format and is translated into a =E2=80=9Ctable.c=E2=
=80=9D file by a new pre-processor ("sty.y=E2=80=9D). Then looking at =
the VAX compilers for 8th and 10th edition, these to use this =E2=80=9Csti=
n=E2=80=9D file.

All the other m68K compilers (based on pcc) that I found appear to =
derive from the V7/32V/SysIII lineage, not from the 8th edition lineage.

A quick google did not yield much background or documentation on the STY =
format.

Anybody on this list that can shed some light on the history of the STY =
table and on how to use it? Any surviving reports or memos that would be =
useful?

Many thanks in advance

Paul
