Subject: [TUHS] Names of famous, historical UNIX machines?
Message-ID: <20170201204327.GU21797@yeono.kjorling.se>

I hope this isn't too far off topic here.

I've been meaning to rename the few systems I administer with names
that reference famous (or at least somewhat well-known in the proper
circles) historical UNIX systems, but I have been unable to find any
lists of such names so have no real place to start. About the closest
I _was_ able to find is the ARPANET map[1] of the late 1970s that is
on Wikipedia and is occasionally circulated, but which gives mostly
architecture, location and links, not any system (host) names.

Short of unimaginative things like calling my home router IMP[2] or
things like that, can anyone either suggest names with a bit of
background (where they were, what hardware, what time period, etc.),
or point me toward online resources where I can find lists of those?
