16/36 PDP-6/10s to the research community with BBN, MIT, Stanford and CMU
sort of being the prime places.   The compilers mostly were the same (close
enough) although the OS's (user interfaces) were all different.  Tenex vs.
ITS vs. WAITS vs. TOPS (sort of).

People forget that the real reason it happened was that UCB had a contract
to get Maxima running on a Vax for DARPA [this work would begat 3BSD].
Only after that, did DARPA switch to the 32 bit vax as the system of
choice.   Stanford wanted VMS and mostly everyone else wanted UNIX.   But
DEC did not support UNIX.    So ... ARPA funded CSRG to support UNIX for
the ARPA contracts.    But remember CSRG did not have everything - just a
support contact [which raised a lot of hackels both inside and outside of
UCB].  For instance networking for UNIX was at BBN not UCB.  And all of
CMU, Stanford and MIT had ARPA $s for basic OS research and other ideas.

The Stanford crew tried to show that VMS was faster than 4BSD.   Joy
famously did the 'FASTVAX' work over a period oa 6-8 weeks and got UNIX
within epsilon of VMS on almost everything and actually faster in a number
of places.  This would become 4.1 - add it was the version that most people
that had vaxen started to use.

creating sockets.  I'm probably not being fair, but it was the BBN stack
hacked to have a new interface.   I ran it on UCBCAD and Sam probably had
it running on 5-10 750s in Evans.  I thought it got sent to a few sites
outside of UCB, but 4.1B was pretty close behind.

a good term for it.   4.2 was not ready when I finished so I brought 4.1c
with me to Masscomp - which is what we started with for the networking
code.  It was what we added MP support to and then added 4.2 fixes when it
came out. But 4.1c was breaking a lot of user mode code and so 4.2 really
did not go out until they had caught most of the issues.

I said, there were people inside of the EECS Dept at UCB that felt that
CSRG was turning the department away from research and they needed to
reclaim that.  And third as others have suggested, Joy went to Sun, and a
number of the others formed BSDi. Kirk was still there and there was still
some work going on, but it was nothing like it was.    The net result was
the desire to keep going was lost, less than going off the rails.  It just
did not have the same people, the same money and as such, the same effort.

Then again, if the idea is running BSD on a Vax, Ultrix 4.5 is even better,
and has all the DEC languages and layered products.

Right - either current NetBSD or the Ultrix 4.5 is what I would do.  If
NetBSD will run the Ultrix layered products, that would be the system with
the most; but I'm not sure if that will work.   Ultrix for instance
supports DEC (VMS) FTN - which I know you (Will) have been messing with.
That is the best (most complete) FTN for Vaxen.  I believe there is Ada,
PL/1 and maybe even Basic2 and Cobol/RPG [I think most of not all of the
VMS languages for the VAX were released on Ultrix but frankly, I don't
remember].
