Here's another data point: when I asked Kirk regarding the public 
availability of the SCCS repo he pointed me to 
http://svnweb.freebsd.org/csrg/.

At https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo you can find a single 
1GB repository that integrates many of the snapshots and version control 
repositories available through TUHS and other sources (including the 
CSRG data).  Its commit history starts on Jun 20th 1972 with the First 
Research Edition and ends with FreeBSD 10 in 2015.  Git blame works 
across all the history's commits.
