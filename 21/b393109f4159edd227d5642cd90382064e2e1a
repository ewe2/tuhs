As the labs folks all probably know, Vic became the Executive Director of
division 91(two levels beyond department head).
This was after Research and Multics and, I think, Safeguard.
One of the early things he asked after quizzing various folks about what
was going on in the division was "Where is your source code control
system?".
The question fell to Rudd Canaday (then a department head under Vic).
And SCCS was thus born.

And who doesn't remember SP&E Aleph Null articles?
