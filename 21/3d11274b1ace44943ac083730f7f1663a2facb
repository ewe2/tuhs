As mentioned before, Sun in theory had the right, but this did not include the 
networking code and code that includes code from Xenix (e.g. ls.c).

Now that Oracle bought Sun, there is few chance even for that because Oracle is 
not known to be OSS friendly.

The other rights owner was SCO....

SCO has been OSS friendly. SCO created the historical UNIX license and a bit
later, I was able to convince SCO to make SCCS OpenSource and got a "final" 
OK in April 2001. But in May 2001, SCO was sold to Caldera Linux and the new
owner was not OSS friendly and canceled the agreement.

This caused a delay for making SCCS OpenSource, as I now had to convince Sun 
and succeeded in December 2006.

Now that a judge ignored the contract between Novell and SCO and followed the 
oral claims from a Novell employee, it seems that somebody would need to 
convince Novell. I doubt that this will have a chance to work.
