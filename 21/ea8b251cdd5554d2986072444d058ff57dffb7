Which puts you in the same boat as the rest of us.

It's certainly unlikely, agreed.  But SCO has done some unlikely
things recently.  You saw the public threat to sue Linus Torvalds
personally?

As far as I can see (somebody please correct me if I'm wrong), most of
the key players at SCO have changed over the last 12 months.  They
appear to have few engineers left, which is presumably one reason why
they gave the UnixWare and Linux code to outsiders to compare.  I'm
not convinced of their understanding of the matters at hand.  For
example, last year Caldera released "ancient UNIX" under a BSD-style
license, but now they're claiming it never happened.  Maybe they don't
know about the company history.  And if the code in dispute is derived
from ancient UNIX, there'll be egg on their face.  

Of course, a simple comparison doesn't show the origin of the code.
If it proves to have been lifted from Linux, they'll *really* look
stupid.
