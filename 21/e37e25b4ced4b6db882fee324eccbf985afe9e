He hacked the MSCP tty handler heavily with a lot MIT features.

It was probably post the MIT job control stuff, but the tty handler I
remember and somewhat miss was a TENEX-like ^T feature that did a one line
ps of the jobs attached to your terminal.

Painful memories ... I remember seeing that early on too V5​ too and
thinking 'what a hack' as we had many glass TTY's with only an ASR33 on the
console back then.  And we were also trying to download binaries (to other
processors) so an 8-bit path was wanted.
