Actually, I think the behavior at the time shows that they wanted to be in
the hardware business -- *e.g. the 3B20​*

*​vs. DEC and IBM's offerings of the day*.  What they failed to understand
was to be in the SW​ business it meant that their customers (IBM, DEC, HP,
Microsoft) needed to succeed in selling >>their own<< hardware by using
AT&T's SW.
