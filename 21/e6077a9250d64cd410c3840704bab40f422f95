OK, so I have learned something about English.

It is and it was quite obvious for me before, I agree with You both,I 
found only words with similar pronounciation(neglecting stress).

Well, I cannot "reproduce it" in my mind this funny feeling I suspect, 
as not natively Enlish speaking.
Hopefully it helped the Unix .Does it cause the smile every time You 
hear it ?
Even now knowing it I will probably ,hearing or reading the word "Unix", 
not associate it with "eunuch".Probably because I have coded Polish 
pronounciation in my mind, or in other words I mostly think in Polish.
