Right... 12 bits of ECC seems a bit much.  Dunno what that stuff is
about... weird! ;)

Nat.Semi. used to make ECC memory boards for the PDP11.

I had one once, it looks like you have one now.  My arithmetic says 5
extra bits per 8-bit byte makes for single-error correcting, dual-error
detecting ECC on the byte level.  Vaxes do it with 39 bits per 32-bit
word, Alphas do it with 72 bits per 64-bit word.  Economy of scale.

As I remember, you could just ignore the ECC and it would work like
a standard parity memory board, except that it very rarely had any
parity errors.

It divides by 13, though (64K x 13 x 8, so the prime factors are 2 and 13).
 Unlikely as it sounds, could this be for a 12-bit word machine?

13 is not only 12+1, it's 8+5.  5 is a common number of bits for ECC
(though not, I admit, for 8-bit words!  Usually it's 8+3, 16+5, or 16+6).

It also strikes me as odd that a NatSemi board should have TI chips on it.
 NatSemi made their own RAM, and Texas made their own PDP-11 and Vax memory
boards.
