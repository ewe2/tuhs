You have two things.   First was the 11/20 memory extension option, the MX11
and then the memory protection system the KS11.   Both came out of the DEC
CSS (the Kludge department).     I believe the MX was the same as the other
non-split I/D memory extensions (like the 34/40).   Don't know about the KS.
