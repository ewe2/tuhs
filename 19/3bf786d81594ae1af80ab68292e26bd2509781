Hi,

Warren put the v6enb.tar.gz into
	http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/TUHS/Archive/PDP-11/Bug_Fixes/V6enb/
Thank you, Warren!

Besides some minor and rather unimportant changes to V6, this file
contains README files, that try to explain how to install
UNIX V6 on Bob Supnik's simulator from the tape file provided by
Ken Wellsch. These setup instructions are aimed at the beginner
level with regard to UNIX as well as to the simulator.

The "bug fixes" are supplied as "diff -e" files on tp-formatted
tape files, ready to be used by the simulator.

Two simple ANSI-C programs are provided to insert (enblock) or remove
(deblock) blocking information in tape files needed by Bob's simulator.

Have fun,

Wolfgang
