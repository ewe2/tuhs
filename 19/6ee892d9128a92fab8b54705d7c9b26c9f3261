Also check out the MIT fall OS course notes.  They ported v6 to the x86 and have course notes with some good detail.  I'm not near my real computer so I don't have the URL handy where I am. If you send me an email off list I'll be happy to pass it on. It's in one of my quora replies so you can google there and find it also
