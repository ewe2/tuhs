Thank you for the tip - very helpful.

 assembler output of =E2=80=98c1=E2=80=99 function by function, building an=
 instruction list. It then performs some portable optimisations (eliminatin=

Thank you again for all this info.

I thought that the revival only meant being able to run code in PDP11 emula=
