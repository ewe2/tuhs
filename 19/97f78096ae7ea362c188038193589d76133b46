Subject: [TUHS] Scot Hacker's 1999-2001 "BeView" columns for Byte.com (BeOS)
Message-ID: <9AC6DC0A-6494-4B59-BD94-DD24203E6354@alchemistowl.org>

Scot Hacker has re-published his BeOS columns for Byte. BeOS was an interesting operating system with a clear Unix inheritance built for a dual-PowerPC system, similar to the Macs of that era.

Its inheritance can be found in Haiku (https://www.haiku-os.org).
