Don't know, but...

I searched for 4.4/SPARC some 12 years back. IIRC on this very mailing
list and elsewhere. I didn't find it. Even Kirk McKusick got slightly
involved but nothing surfaced.

Have you tried NetBSD 1.1? (The first NetBSD release to support PMAX.)

Note: You can use a HP400 also. I have a 433t running 4.4BSD. I used
a netbooted NetBSD to get it installed.

I'd love to get a copy of 4.4BSD/SPARC or PMAX.
