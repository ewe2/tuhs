So what I'm hearing is Linux's timeline, which includes things that were 
not developed just for Linux, extends further out than SunOS does.

Again, I'm including everything ... You could make a case for certain 
Unixes that do not include a pre-existing C compiler being bounded by 
their own development (or any other operating system that needs a 
precursor).  For example, say there was an operating system that used a 
C compiler to build itself that was developed 10 years before. That 
example operating system's timeline would have to include said C 
compiler IMHO.

On the other hand, an operating system who's sole method of creation was 
engineered in year 0, and was "developed" for 10 years and ended, we 
could say that OS's timeline was a solid 10 years.

All I'm saying is comparing Linux's timeline to something like SunOS has 
to include everything that went into both because they both relied on 
precursors.

Side note: I'm a bit of a bitch when it comes to Linux - which doesn't 
mean I don't think Linux is "UNIX" - it just means I think it's the 
Coherent of today's UNIX ;)
