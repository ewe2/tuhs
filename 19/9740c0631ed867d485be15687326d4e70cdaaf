Oh, tell her it can always get worse.  4 chainsaws, a log splitter,
a tractor, an ATV, a truck, a van, a boxer motorcycle, a dual sport 
about to be dropped off, a work shop the size of a good sized apartment
filled w/ woodworking and metal working tools (and a well stocked fridge),
3 canoes, and a bunch of other stuff not even counting the geek stuff :)

It can get worse, much much worse :-)
