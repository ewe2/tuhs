I don't know; that's subjective.

That's incomplete, in that it implies that an option is the only way to
achieve the goal of reducing the perceived pain, but that's not the case.
(Note I'm not saying you intended that as an interpretation, but it's a
reasonable intuition for an intention.)

An interesting counterpoint to this argument is how columnized "ls" is
handled under Plan 9: there is no `-C` option to `ls` there; instead,
there's a general-purpose `mc` filter that figures out the size of the
window it's running in, reads its input, decides how many columns the input
will fit into, and emits it columnized. But yes, it would be a pain to type
`ls | mc` every time one wanted columnized `ls` output, so this is wrapped
up into a shell script called `lc`. Note that this lets you do stuff like,
`lc -l` and see multi-column long listings if the window is wide enough.

I got so used to this from plan9 that I keep an approximation in
$HOME/bin/lc: `exec ls -ACF "$@"`.

For the `humanize` thing, I don't see why one couldn't have an `lh` command
that generated "human-friendly long output from ls."

That's true, but now the logic is specialized to ls, and not applicable to
anything else (e.g., du? df? wc, perhaps?). Similarly with `-,`. It is not
general purpose, which is unfortunate.

Granted, combining these things would be a little challenging, but is it
likely that one would want `ls -l,h`? Optimize for the common case, etc....

And then there's the question why you don't like the standard output.

By default, plan9 would quote filenames that had characters that were
special to the shell (there wasn't really the concept of "non-printable
characters in the Unix/TTY sense); this could be disabled by specifying the
`-Q` option.
