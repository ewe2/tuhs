Consider

% refile -he
Usage: refile [msgs] [switches] +folder ...
  switches are:
  -draft
  -[no]link
  -[no]preserve
  -[no]retainsequences
  -[no]unlink
  -src +folder
  -file file
  -rmmproc program
  -normmproc
  -version
  -help
...

vs

% ls -z
ls: invalid option -- z
usage: ls [-ABCFGHILPRSTUWZabcdfghiklmnopqrstuwxy1,] [--color=3Dwhen] =
[-D format] [file ...]
