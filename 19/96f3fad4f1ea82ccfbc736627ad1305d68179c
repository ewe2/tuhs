Double argh. When I couldn't find the Jan 1985 copy of the Unix Review
magazine, it caused a tingle in my synapses. They finally reminded me that
I had scanned that issue in, and I've just put it up in the archive at
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Documentation/Unix_Review/unixreview_1985jan.pdf

pages 43 and 117 are there :-)

Cheers, Warren
