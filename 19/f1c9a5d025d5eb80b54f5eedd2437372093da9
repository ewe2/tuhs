Graphical displays of data excel in showing relationships and patterns. 
Discovering patterns in text can be much, much harder.  Hence the blink
comparator in astronomy.  And Fred Hoyle's feeble attempt to describe such a
form of data transfer in "The Black Cloud".

But a lot depends on one's familiarity with the idioms of the graphical data -
anyone can see a desolate outback, but it took an Albert Namatjira to make us
see it as beautiful.
