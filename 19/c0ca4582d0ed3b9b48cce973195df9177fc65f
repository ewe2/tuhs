Subject: [TUHS] Happy birthday, Niklaus Wirth!

Computer pioneer Niklaus Wirth was born on this day in 1934; he basically 
designed ALGOL, one of the most influential languages ever, with just 
about every programming language in use today tracing its roots to it.

His name is pronounced "vurt" but he would accept "worth", and he joked 
that you could call him by name or by value (you need to know ALGOL to 
understand).
