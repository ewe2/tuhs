Archive.org is great at this sort of thing.  It may be worth reaching
out to Jason Scott (jason@textfiles.com) for assistance with some of the
digital artifacts.  His personal area of interest is more in the 80s BBS
era, but he knows the ins and outs of preserving things in context.  It
doesn't hurt that he's a great guy, too.
