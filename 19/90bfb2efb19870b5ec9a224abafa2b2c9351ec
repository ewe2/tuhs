Thanks for the insight, definitely a stronger case for 4.1BSD being involve=
d in some way, shape, or form. Here are a few SCCS strings from V8 vs 4BSD =
and 4.1(c)BSD.

init:

V8      - "@(#)init.c=094.3 (Berkeley) 10/13/80"
4BSD    - "@(#)init.c=094.3 (Berkeley) 10/13/80"
4.1cBSD - "@(#)init.c=094.10 (Berkeley) 12/22/82"

getty:

V8      - "@(#)getty.c=094.1 (Berkeley) 10/1/80"
4BSD    - "@(#)getty.c=094.1 (Berkeley) 10/1/80"
4.1cBSD - "@(#)getty.c=094.9 4.9 82/12/23"

Locore (not an SCCS string, but comment at top):

V8      - "Locore.c=094.11=0981/05/15"
4BSD    - "Locore.c=094.4=0911/10/80"
4.1BSD  - "Locore.c=094.11=0981/05/15" (Note, used the BBN VAX version here=
, I couldn't find the kernel sources in the 4.1cBSD on the archive...)

Main (kernel):

V8      - "main.c=094.14=0981/04/23"
4BSD    - "main.c=094.2=0911/9/80"
4.1BSD  - "main.c=094.14=0981/04/23"

crt0: This one doesn't have SCCS info, is identical between V8 and 4BSD in =
ASM.  The crt0 in 4.1cBSD is in C instead, so not really comparable.

doprnt (c library):

V8      - "@(#)doprnt.s=094.3 (Berkeley) 3/22/81"
4BSD    - No string...
4.1cBSD - "@(#)doprnt.s=094.4 (Berkeley) 11/25/81"

Granted, this isn't exhaustive by any means, but everything I've checked ha=
s shown a much stronger 4 through 4.1cBSD character than V7/32V.  It's too =
bad the march from V7 to V8 isn't more documented, what I'm starting to see=
 here is a incremental approach where perhaps 4BSD was picked up, started t=
o be modified into a research version, and as useful developments were made=
 at Berkeley, they continued to merge in as well as make local changes unti=
l V8 was born.

This is all speculation on my part though, I don't want to establish histor=
y I wasn't there for, but there is a strong case for V8 starting possibly a=
s 4BSD with a pretty open door to continuing to pull from BSD for a little =
while.  Specifically, I've seen more 4BSD alignment in userland, more 4.1BS=
D alignment in the kernel, but it's all, as Dennis put it, "pretty eclectic=
".

hunk of code from 4BSD. Compare init, getty, locore.c (as opposed to .s in =
V7 back). Heck, even the main.c between the two kernels are more similar to=
 each other than V7. I would almost opt towards calling that being rebased =
on 4BSD rather than V7 with bits and pieces of BSD added. I could see it be=
ing more beneficial to start with 4BSD and tack on necessary Bell bits rath=
er than take V7/32V and try and shoehorn in the VM implementation for VAX.

in terms of raw comparison, I suspect the basis is 4BSD rather than 4.1cBSD=
. I don't know that we have a clean copy of 4.1BSD gold, I'd be interested =
to see if the structure of the source code changed between 4.1 and 4.1c, as=
 4.1c does exhibit the new organization by the BSD folks, 4BSD still shows =
folders like cmd, lib, and so on.
