Arnold, I caution on absolutes.   Typesetter C predates V7.  It was for V6 b=
ut a release of ditroff  may have been after V7. - do remember something lik=
e that in the early 80s.  What I do not remember the order of which compiler=
s.  The driver for writing ditroff was the Labs getting an APS5 typesetter w=
hich was in the late 70s. =20

And (I=E2=80=99m less) certain here, I think Bourne once told me they used t=
he APS5 for the V7 manual set masters because it supported more fonts.  =20

Btw. The whole reason why typesetter C had a compiler included was the v6 co=
mpiler was not insufficient (primarily missing support for stdio) but V7 was=
 not. =20

That said the dates and some of the ordering are fuzzy in my mind at this po=
int.  I=E2=80=99m trying to use other things that I have absolute dates for a=
nd trying line them up.  =20

We had V5, quickly upgraded the V6, then TS and finally V7.  I left in late S=
pring =E2=80=9879.   That order I know is right and Ted was the reason we ha=
d TS as he brought it with him in 76 / 77.  (Same for the proofs for K&R1). =
 =20

We got typesetter C at some point I thought before Ted brought TS but that=E2=
=80=99s fuzzy. =20

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.=
