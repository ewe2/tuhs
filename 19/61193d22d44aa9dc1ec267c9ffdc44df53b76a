This Venix has been available from Barry Kort and ftp.update.uu.se/professional
for many years.  It is "Pro/Venix" versions 1 and 2.  Pro/Venix came directly
from VentureCom, the vendor who ported it.  More desirable is "Venix/Pro"
especially version 2.  Venix/Pro came from DEC, who got it from VentureCom and
spiffed it up a bit for the Pro.  Anyone who has or comes across floppies for
Venix/Pro from DEC should really archive them (and please let me know!  I have
a set of floppies with one or two bad disks).

Whether this is "legal" or not is up to some question.  VentureCom put Pro/Venix
out in the public domain, but the only "proof" of this is its widely available
existence and a verbal statement from the person who first got it.  At some
point in the past, I think Bob Supnik thought it was reasonable that DEC would
put its interests in the product in the Ancient Unix license, but he no longer
works for DEC.  There is also some question whether this Venix was ported from
System III, which would eliminate it from the Ancient Unix license and the new
form of it.
