I agree with Ted and I'm seeing it to this day, I hang with some BSD
folks and they spend way too much time complaining about people.  Sorry,
but that's my take.  Maybe the world is as shitty as they say it is but
my world wasn't that great, you just roll up your sleeves and make a 
difference.  I dunno, it does seem different, maybe it was easy for
me and it is hard for them but I don't like the complaining.

Linus, in my opinion, is a great programmer (all you have to do is read
his rants about obscure stuff and it is clear he knows the details of a
ton of stuff), a great architect (I could be pushed back a little on 
this one but he is good), and a great manager.  He inspires other people
to do well, he pushes for a good code base, he hates shitty code.  He
is a leader, you can argue about his faults but he leads.  And I have
*never* seen all those skill sets in one person.  I've said that at 
least 20 years ago and it is true today.

The BSD crowd lacked that sort of leader.  So
{386,Net,Open,Free,DragonFly}BSD all have their own crowd but they are
tiny crowds.

I say this with dismay, I'm a SunOS 4.x guy, that's the bugfixed BSD.
I loved BSD Unix, it was the best and it had the chance to be the 
future but for whatever reason the "leaders" in BSD didn't have an
actual leader.  Not one of them.  Not 1/100th of the leader that 
Linus is.

So Linux won.  I'm not that happy about it, I could imagine a world
where BSD won and I think I'd be happier in that world but it didn't
happen.
