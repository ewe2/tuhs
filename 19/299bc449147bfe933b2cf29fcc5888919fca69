It's pretty old. Both TENEX and ITS had the ability to map file pages into a
process' address space. Not sure if anything else of that vintage had it (not
sure what other systems back then _had_ paging, other than Atlas; those two
both had custom KA10 homebrew hardware mods to support paging). Of course,
there's always Multics... (sorry, Ken :-).
