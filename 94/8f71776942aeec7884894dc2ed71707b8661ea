True, but It’s not 4.3 BSD …  I was hoping for something vintage of the era, just as Solaris 11 is SYSV, but it’s nothing like SYSVr2 on the VAX….

And historical is far more interesting than something I can just go buy retail….   Speaking as someone who’s own a NeXT, and even bought OS X Server 1.0 on release.
