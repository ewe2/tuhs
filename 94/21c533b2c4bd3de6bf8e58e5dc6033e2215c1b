Subject: [TUHS] APL\360 Source Code Released
Message-ID: <FC3FB61A-3986-4198-A65E-1040B462EF1D@orthanc.ca>

After a 10-year quest, the Computer History Museum has convinced IBM to make the source code for APL\360 available to the public.  The license terms are for personal use only, no copying allowed.

The code itself is quite entertaining to read in some areas :-)  About 37K lines of 360 macro assembler, which includes most of an interactive time-shared terminal OS environment upon which to run the APL interpreter.

http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/the-apl-programming-language-source-code/ has lots of background material, and the link to the download page.  Note that the links in the bibliography section on that page are broken â€“ the all contain a spurious '.' at the end of the URL anchors.
