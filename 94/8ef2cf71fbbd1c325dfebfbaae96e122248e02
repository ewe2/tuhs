Quite true. Modern Bourne shells let you supply a number to break and
continue to specify how many loops to break.  Ada, or maybe it was one of
the Modula-X languages, let you put a label on a loop so that you could
say `continue outer' or `break outer' and not need the booleans.

This is something that newer languages (C#, Java, Go, ...) could have picked
up but didn't, which I think is too bad.
