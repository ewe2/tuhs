Here's an example:

http://www.mcvoy.com/lm/bkdocs/UG/

is the source, you can look at those files, they are nroff -ms source,
and then look at 

http://www.mcvoy.com/lm/bkdocs/UG/tmp

and you'll see the web version of the docs.  Which is pretty useful.
You've got all the .NH 1 headers in the table of contents down the
left side, and when you click one of them it shows you the .NH 2,
.NH 3 etc headers for just that section.

And if you go to

http://www.mcvoy.com/lm/bkdocs/UG/tmp/map.html

you can get html versions of any .NH 1 section, or the entire thing as one
page.

It's a ~1700 line perl program (perl 4ish) and it has some ability to skin
the content.  Source in http://www.mcvoy.com/lm/bkdocs/UG/webroff
