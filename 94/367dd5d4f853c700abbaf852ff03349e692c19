I=E2=80=99ve done a fair amount of research on Sun 1=E2=80=99s since I have o=
ne ( and it has one of the original 68k motherboards with the original proms=
 ).  It=E2=80=99s on my list to create a Sun 1 registry along the lines of t=
he Apple 1 registry. (https://www.apple1registry.com/)
Right now, I can positively identify 24 machines that still exist.  Odd seri=
al numbering makes it very hard to know exactly how many they made. =20

Cisco was sued by Stanford over the Sun 1.  =46rom what I read, they made of=
f with some Stanford property ( SW and HW ). Wikipedia mentions this ( and I=
 have some supporting documents as well ). They ended up licensing from Stan=
ford as part of the settlement.  =46rom what I=E2=80=99ve gathered VLSI lice=
nsed the design from Stanford not Andy directly. However the only produced a=
 few machines and Andy wasn=E2=80=99t all that happy with that. That was one=
 of the impetus is to getting sun formed and licensing the same design.  I a=
lso believe another company ( or 2 )licensed the design but either didn=E2=80=
=99t produce any or very very few machines.=20

You can tell a difference between VLSI boards and the Sun Microsystems board=
s because the SUN is all capitalized on the VLSI boards ( and is Sun on the o=
thers ).  At least on the few I=E2=80=99ve seen pictures of.=20

The design was also licensed to SGI =E2=80=94 I=E2=80=99ve seen a prototype S=
GI board that=E2=80=99s the same thing with a larger PCB to allow some exten=
sions.=20

And the original CPU boards didn=E2=80=99t have an MMU. They could only run S=
un OS up to 0.9, I believe was the version. When Bill Joy got there, again f=
rom what I=E2=80=99ve gathered, he wanted to bring more of the BSD code over=
 and they had to change the system board.  This is why you see the Sun 1/150=
 model number ( as an upgrade to the original Sun 1/100 designation ).  The r=
ack mounted Sun 1/120 was changed to the 1/170. The same upgraded CPU board w=
as used in the Sun 2/120 at least initially.  =20

The original Sun OS wasn=E2=80=99t BSD based.  It was a V32 variant I believ=
e.  And the original CPU boards were returned to Sun, I believe as part of t=
he upgrade from the 1/100 to the 1/150. ( Given people had just paid $10,000=
 for a machine having to replace the entire machine would=E2=80=99ve been ba=
d from a customer perspective).  Sun did board upgrade trade ups after this (=
 I worked at a company and we purchased an upgrade to upgrade a Sun 3/140 to=
 a Sun 3/110 =E2=80=94 the upgrade consisted of a CPU board swap and a diffe=
rent badge for the box )=20

Sun then, from when I can tell, sold the original CPU boards to a German com=
pany that was producing a V32 system.  They changed out the PROMs but you ca=
n see the Sun logo and part numbers on the boards=20

I could go on and on about this topic =F0=9F=99=82
A Sun 1 was a =E2=80=9Cbucket list=E2=80=9D machine for me - and I am still h=
appy that some friends were willing to take a 17 hour road trip from Atlanta=
 to Minnesota to pick mine up.  =F0=9F=99=82

After unparking the drive heads it booted up, first try ( I was only willing=
 to try that without a bunch of testing work because I have some spare power=
 supplies and a couple plastic tubs of multi bus boards that came with it =F0=
=9F=99=82)=20
