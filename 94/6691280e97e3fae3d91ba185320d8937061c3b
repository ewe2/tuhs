Efficiency isn't always the issue.   Even with the single layer break (and
certainly with the local goto) you can break structure.
The language, in my opinion, doesn't need further ways to break structure.


I'd have settled for a more robust preprocessor language, but such is life
with what was a ground breaking language back in the  70's.

Most of my complaints about C are because it's "standard" library was awful
back in the seventies and it really didn't improve much over the years.

Interesting comments on how effectively CPUs and compilers handle inner
loops of interpreters:

Lots more research on interpreter efficiency:
