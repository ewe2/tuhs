Erik,

Thanks for the reply & the account of your work.=20
You seemed to do a lot less work than I saw networking teams forced =
into.
As you say, =E2=80=9Cwork with it=E2=80=9D.

I worked at the ANU for a short time.=20
They used a Class-B, with address ranges delegated to (many) local =
admin, but Central IT demanded every device connect to their switch, =
which allowed them to monitor ports.
I think they=E2=80=99d have a hard time renumbering, my section didn=E2=80=
=99t even have DHCP.

Here=E2=80=99s the reference I spared the list initially.
Very thin on details. The only more detailed info is a video.

Australia Post's telco transformation named top IT project
		=
<https://www.itnews.com.au/news/australia-posts-telco-transformation-named=
-top-it-project-581371>

	Billed as the largest project of its type, the project wrapped =
up in November last year after more than two years of work to address =
critical network performances challenges and high operating costs.
	The telecommunication transformation saw the rollout a new =
software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) across 4000 sites.
