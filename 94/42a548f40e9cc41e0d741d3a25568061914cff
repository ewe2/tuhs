Question: In BSD-land, how do you "version" something like this? Two 
different "snapshots" of BSD 4.2 - what file/version #/whatever is used 
to definitely put a "version number" on this?

FYI, the distribution I have, vfont.tar is truncated, it was the last 
file on the first tape, and at the time may have had a read error. 
4,372,480 bytes of it were read, while the TUHS version is 5,888,000

However, the part that I have which is about 80% of the tar matches the 
first 74% of the TUHS 4.2BSD distribution after extracting the files, 
even though the checksum of that first 74% doesn't match.

So when I cobble this together, I'll just use the TUHS 4.2BSD vfont.tar 
and make a note of it in the index.
