There is a somewhat modern port of V6 to the 286, which is in the archive (http://minnie.tuhs.org/Archive/Other/V6on286/). There is also a modern x86 port of V7 available at http://www.nordier.com/v7x86/ This one is more interesting as it aims to run in modern machines and includes a bootable CD image.

Best regards,

I got them, but they work on PDP-11.  I'd like to see an version of Unix
working on Intel x86.  As far as I know, SVR4 was the first Unix working
on this architecture. 

If I recall correctly Unix V6 was only ported on Interdata 7/32
computers.  I'd like to get the sources of a small Unix kernel working
on x86.

Has anyone ported Unix V6 on x86?


Thanks for your replies,
