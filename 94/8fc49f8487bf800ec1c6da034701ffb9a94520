Thread fork as we're drifting from documentation research specifically.

One matter that keeps coming to mind for me is the formal history of the ru=
nlevel-based init system.=C2=A0 It isn't in Research obviously, nor was it =
in PWB.=C2=A0 The first time it shows up in the wild is System III, but thi=
s version is slightly different than what was in CB-UNIX at the time, which=
 is what eventually wound up in System V.

The pressing question is whether the version in System III represents an ea=
rlier borrowing from CB or if perhaps the runlevel init started in USG, got=
 bumped over to CB and improved, then that improved version came back to su=
pported UNIX in 5.0.

As for the notable differences:

SysIII init allows for runlevels 1-9.=C2=A0 It will call /etc/rc with the c=
urrent state, the prior state, and the number of times the current state ha=
s been entered.=C2=A0 If the script is called for instance due to a powerfa=
ilure, then the current state is passed suffixed with an 'x'.=C2=A0 The ini=
ttab entries are in a different format:

    state:id:flags:process

Where state is the runlevel, id is a two-character identifier, flags can be=
 either 'c' (like respawn) or 'o' (like off I think).  No flag then indicat=
es to run once.  Flags 't' or 'k' will terminate or kill a process before i=
t is started again if a given runlevel is entered and it is already running=
.


This of course is in contrast to SysV init which instead offers runlevels 0=
-6 as well as a, b, and c.  Init itself can be called with runlevels S|s or=
 Q|q additionally and these act as calls to enter single user mode or rerun=
 the current init state if I'm understanding correctly.  Neither S nor Q op=
tions appear to be valid for the inittab runlevel.  Init tab entries here a=
re:

    id:rstate:action:process

Where id and rstate are essentially just the same fields from SysIII swappe=
d.  Action replaces the flags field with the more well known respawn, wait,=
 once, initdefault, etc. behaviors.


All in all, different enough that inittabs between the two wouldn't be comp=
atible.  SysV also includes the telinit command which appears to be able to=
 handle those a, b, and c runlevels.

Anywho, that's my understanding of the init changes, with the pertinent que=
stion remaining whether the SysIII-style init ultimately started from the s=
ame place as SysV, or if the general design idea was there between USG and =
CB, and they got to a similar answer from different directions.  Colon-deli=
mited /etc files aren't uncommon, so while unlikely, it could be entirely p=
ossible the two inittab formats arose relatively independently, but the tru=
th remains obscure in my mind at least.  I don't really blame Research for =
not picking up this init system, it seems like there were a few parallel st=
reams of development around the turn of the 80s, and the easier answer was =
probably to just stay the course.  I seem to recall reading in a thread som=
ewhere Rob Pike discussing the resistance in the Research group regarding s=
ucking up each and every little feature USG tried to promulgate as standard=
, and this init system got specific mention.
