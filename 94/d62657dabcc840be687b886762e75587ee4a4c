​That would have so much like Ted.   I never heard that story, but I would
believe it.  I do believe that he told them (rightfully) that it was
primarily developed at CMU using CMU computing resources (the 11/34A for
the Digital Lab in the EE Dept that Ted and I ran).  IIRC: the primary
feature hat he did to it at Summit besides support for the changes in the
V7 filesystems, was support for large disks (aka RP06) when attached to a
small address space (11/40 class) systems, of which CMU had a number as I
believe the Labs did also.   Armando's I believe you two were office mates
in those days, do you have memory?


    We had it at Tektronix because I brought it from CMU.
