Clem,

Ha! I'm curious by nature. I recently was sent a book that references 
SVR2 and that is enough impetus for me to want to try it out 'for real' 
:). Shiny object, for sure.

Which is why I went looking for SVR2 - substantive (although to me 
completely opaque) differences from SVR1 and SVR3. The book mentions 
SVR2, not SVR1 or SVR3, though, I'm sure it applies equally well to 
those as well, I'm just a sucker for the closest experience I can get 
without driving myself off the rails trying to get things working. Turns 
out it isn't horrible, this time. Angelo's Vax 780 version works about 
like v6/v7 in SIMH - stupid # and @ stuff, but I'm guessing I can change 
it without mucking about in the source this time. - stty'll prolly do it.

Later,

Will
