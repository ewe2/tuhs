Subject: [pups] Networking With 2.11 BSD and Begemot Emulator
Message-ID: <Pine.NEB.4.21.0010031544040.23696-100000@panix2.panix.com>

I've been trying to set up an emulated PDP-11 running 2.11 BSD.  Just for
the fun,  I'm trying to get the 11 to talk on a LAN.  Unfortunately,  it's
not working.

My configuration is Begemot P11 Version 2.7 running under
FreeBSD 4.1.1.  I've booted 2.11,  configured a custom networking kernel,
installed the unix and netnix images,  changed the IP addresses in
/etc/hosts to match my LAN,  run mkhosts to rebuild  /etc/hosts.dir and
/etc/hosts.pag and rebooted.

On the P11 front,  I've built a fake qma.rom file populated with zeros --
just like the P11 README file said,  made sure that I had a tun driver
configured in my FreeBSD system,  and started P11.   Then I did an

	ifconfig tun0 host-IP-address emulator-IP-address up

Running ifconfig on the host confirmed that things *seemed* to be OK:

# ifconfig tun0
tun0: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1518
        inet6 fe80::260:8ff:febd:5882%tun0 --> :: prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xb
        inet host-IP-address --> emulator-IP-address netmask 0xffff0000
        Opened by PID 32199

The IP addresses are identical in the first three octets,  and differ only
in the last octet.

Unfortunately,  once I boot 2.11 BSD,  I can't contact the "outside
world" from the emulator,  nor contact the emulator from the
outside.  No telnet,  no ftp,  pings just hang.

Everything looks OK from inside:

# ifconfig qe0
qe0: flags=63<UP,BROADCAST,NOTRAILERS,RUNNING>
        inet emulator-IP-address netmask ffff0000 broadcast Bcast-IP

What am I missing?

Thanks in advance,

Frank

There's a bug.  It used to work, and *something* changed.  I've been
meaning to look at it, but it's currently waiting on the tuit queue.

I know the README says this will work, but I haven't been able to get
it to work that way.  Somewhere I have a real image; I'll see if I can
find it.

	You're missing ARP.

	'tun' only works with IP - ARP packets are not IP and do not pass
	thru the 'if_tun' driver.

	I have (using BSD/OS 4.1's if_tun which is probably the same as
	FreeBSD's) an emulated 11 going quite nicely.

	What you need to do ON THE 11's SIDE, is populate his arp table with
	the information about any host on the local LAN that the 11 will
	want to talk to

	In /etc/netstart on the 11 side just after the 'ifconfig' lines:

	ifconfig qe0 inet netmask $netmask $hostname broadcast $broadcast up -trailers >/dev/console 2>&1
	# ifconfig sl0 inet 192.254.254.2 192.254.254.1 -arp -trailers >/dev/console 2>&1
	# slattach /dev/ttyS6 9600
	# Next line needed when running under the Begemot emulator
	arp -s 206.139.202.1 "0:0:c:3d:e9:f7" pub
	arp -s 206.139.202.51 "0:a0:24:78:9c:21" pub
 	arp -s 206.139.202.200 "0:90:27:88:64:74" pub
 	arp -s 206.139.202.201 "08:0:2b:f:5b:a6" pub
	arp -s 206.139.202.209 "0:40:5:a4:72:27" pub
	ifconfig lo0 inet localhost up -trailers	>/dev/console 2>&1

	Typically you only need the ARP info for the hosting system and
	the default gateway.   

	Oh, there's a bug in P11 that after 25 days of calendar up time the
	clock on the 11 basically stops ticking.   I've a fix I came up with
	(and submitted to the author) but it'll be a couple weeks until I
	know for sure if it's the right fix (32bit overflow in a calculation).

I didn't need to do this when I had the emulated net running.  I did
set the netmask to 255.255.255.255, though, and put the default route
through that interface.

	I thought you mentioned using the 'tap' driver rather than 'tun'
	at one time.   If my memory hasn't failed me that would explain
	why it worked since 'tap' passes ARP traffic.

	The missing piece I forgot earlier was on the hosting machine's
	side to publish an ARP entry for the simulated 11.

	Just after ifconfig'ing tun0 up use the hosting system's mac address:

ifconfig tun0 206.139.202.200 206.139.202.203 up
arp -s shemp 0:90:27:88:64:74 pub

	I'm not sure how ARP can be made to work thru the 'tun' device.
	Without ARP on an ethernet I am not aware of any 'routing' that 
	can fill in the mac addresses in the ethernet packets.   

	Try pub'ing the arp entries and see if that works.   Might try 'tap'
	instead of 'tun' if you're looking for something else to try.
