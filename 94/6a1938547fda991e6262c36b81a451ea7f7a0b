I downloaded 32V after thinking and thinking and thinking about it, and of 
course untarred and defeathered it, then had a look at some of the source 
code.

I got a buzz out of reading it!  (I usually don't give myself time to read 
source code, so I suppose I get out of the habit of thinking of it as a 
pleasure.  And University tends to make one think of it as a chore ;^)

Just thought I'd pass that on - and thanks to everybody - AT&T, UOC at Berkeley, 
SCO, Caldera and PUPS/TUHS for allowing me my unexpected pleasures!

Much appreciated!
