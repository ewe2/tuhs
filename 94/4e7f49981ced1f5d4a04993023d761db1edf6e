I'll admit to being butt hurt about all of these journal places being behind
a paywall.  90% or 99.9% of that work was funded by our tax dollars, right?
Then the journal organization says you have to pay more.

It pisses me off.  If you are doing research you want to share that to help
the world.  Then you publish and they hide your work behind a paywall.
