All the AMD Ryzen CPUs and chipsets have built-in ECC.  It's easy since
the CPU pins talk directly to main memory.  This is one among thousands
of reasons to avoid buying Intel CPUs.

The machine I'm typing on has ECC memory, and I bought it in 2019.  You
have to pick a motherboard that wasn't designed by dolts.  (I got the
Gigabyte Aorus "AX-370-GAMING5", which of course is no longer
manufactured.)  And you have to spend an extra $5 or $10 on your DIMMs.
Get the motherboard maker's "Qualified Vendor List", e.g.:

    http://download.gigabyte.us/FileList/Memory/mb_memory_ga-ax370-gaming5_pinnacle_v4.pdf

Be sure there *are* some approved ECC dimms on the list.  Buy those.
You may or may not have to fiddle something in the BIOS settings.

Check dmesg when you first boot the machine (booting the installer is
fine).  Make sure the Linux kernel sees the DIMMS, isn't subverted by
the BIOS, and understands the CPU/memory control registers.  When it
works, you'll see something like:

[    0.180161] EDAC MC: Ver: 3.0.0
[    9.389338] EDAC amd64: Node 0: DRAM ECC enabled.
[    9.389339] EDAC amd64: F17h detected (node 0).

[    9.389380] EDAC amd64: using x8 syndromes.
[    9.389380] EDAC amd64: MCT channel count: 2

[    9.389429] AMD64 EDAC driver v3.5.0

Success!  Non-flaky main memory in a PC clone!  Cost: about $50 plus
paying attention.
