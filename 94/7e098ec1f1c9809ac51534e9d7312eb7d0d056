Constant angular velocity means faster "linear" velocity for
tracks further away from the center.  Since 1990 or so disk
tracks are divided up in 16 or so "zones", where outer zones
have more blocks per track.  This translates to higher
throughput.

A modern Seagate Exos SAS disk may have a range of 279MB/s
(outermost) to 136MB/s (innermost) or 300MB/s to 210MB/s for
faster disks (15Krpm).  Disk vendors don't seem to break this
range out for consumer drives. But you can measure it using
tools like diskinfo on FreeBSD. For example:

# diskinfo -t /dev/ada4 # this is an 5 year old 1TB WD "Black" disk.
/dev/ada4
	...
        Not_Zoned       # Zone Mode <<== this seems wrong.
        ...
