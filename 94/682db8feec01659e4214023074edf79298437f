If this option was added back then (992-94) I might have switched
over. I think I was tempted as it was =E2=80=9Cprogrammable=E2=80=9D. =
But as it didn=E2=80=99t
have any other new features that I really wanted plus I was always
messing up undo/redo, probably like Clem, there was not much
point in switching. As it happens, I didn=E2=80=99t use the =
programmability
feature even when it was added to nvi!

No point in advocating as anyone who is used to the =E2=80=9Cmore=E2=80=9D=
 of vim
would be frustrated with nvi!
