What John didn't mention, he just assumes people know and everyone is
the same, is that he is an excellent C programmer, I could fix bugs
in his code.

You can always fine someone who will make a mess of any language.
That's not the point.  

Assume that you have decent programmers, you will be able to understand
and fix their C code.  If you have really good C programmers, like
my company did, you can start to predict what the bottom half of the
function looks like by reading the top half.  We wrote very stylized C,
were not afraid of gotos when used wisely.
