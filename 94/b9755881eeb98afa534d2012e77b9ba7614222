I booted a FreeBSD/i386 4 system, sans compilers and a few other things,
off 16MB CF card in the early 2000s. I did both static (one binary) and
dynamic and found dynamic worked a lot better for the embedded system...

I also did a 8MB PoC router and data logger image that was stripped to the
bone.

PicoBSD fit onto a 1.44MB floppy as lat as FreeBSD 4 and made a good
firewall...
