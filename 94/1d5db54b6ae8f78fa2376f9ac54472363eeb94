I always spelled out the two-letter commands: e-d, a-r, l-s, r-m, c-p.
chmod I pronounced as ch-mod (not mode), but 'rmdir' was 'remove dir'
and for some reason, mv was move. (I think the doc for vi officially
stated that the proram's name was to be pronounced v-i and not 'vie'.)

Undoubtedly there were many regional differences... :-)
