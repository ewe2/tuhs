Hi Arnold,

I'm more used to ‘hard-wired’ logic versus ‘micro-programmed’ for
microcode but random logic in a known term in this context:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_logic

    Random logic is a semiconductor circuit design technique that
    translates high-level logic descriptions directly into hardware
    features such as AND and OR gates.  The name derives from the fact
    that few easily discernible patterns are evident in the arrangement
    of features on the chip and in the interconnects between them.

Cheers, Ralph.
