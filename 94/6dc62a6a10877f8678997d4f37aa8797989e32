Subject: [pups] Installing BSD on 11/44 without tapedrive ?
Message-ID: <19978.1032870125@www36.gmx.net>

Hello,

My PDP11/44 is currently running RSX11M but since I lack experience and
documentation of RSX, I'd like to install a BSD-Unix.
I suppose I can install  2.11BSD or 2.9BSD on a 11/44. Which one should I
choose ? I do allready have 2.11 on my 11/93, so I might want to try 2.9BSD if
this is not asking for trouble.
I do have 1Mb of ram, two RL02 drives (and some disks, so I can always keep
RSX), FPU, Ethernet.
But I don't have a tapedrive!
I thought I could write the RL02 disks on my 11/93 and then put them in my
11/44. Will this work ? Is there something special I need to know ?

Regards,
--lothar
