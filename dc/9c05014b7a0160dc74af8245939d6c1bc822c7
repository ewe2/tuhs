I thought that I'd read in the FM that they do.  I see now that I was 
mistaken, perhaps delusional.  I see now that <sys/stat.h> contains the gospel:

#define S_IFIFO 0010000         /* named pipe (fifo) - Not used by 2.11BSD */

I'll send a progress report if I decide to continue this project.  Thanks for 
your help, Mr. Schultz.
