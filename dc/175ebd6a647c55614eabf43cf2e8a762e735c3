Thanks for questioning this statement! It seems as if I might have
mixed different memories up. A quick look at GNU ed showed nothing
to support my statement. Sorry for pretending stuff without fact
checking.


My look was at version 1.4, which is the newest one I could look
into. I'm pretty sure I examined GNU ed 1.6 back then, because
that version is in the Pkgfile of my system, but unfortunately I
am unable to find it anywhere. The GNU release mirrors lack all
version 1.5 through 1.10 -- why that? They must have been
released, at least 1.6, because that is used on my system.
Unfortunately I also was unable to access the Changelog of a
newer version to check for changes, because these are lzip
compressed (tar.lz) ... whatever that is, I cannot uncompress it
on my system. Furthermore I neither could find an online
browsable web repo view for checking out version 1.6 or at least
viewing the files within the browser. There's only a cvs repo
access (no cvs on my machine) and it talks about the web page
repo not the ed source repo. Not sure what to think of that.

That's not how things should be. Actually, I'm a bit depressed
now ...

P.S.
Wikipedia writes that `ed' would be pronounced ``ee-dee'' (like
``vee-eye''), is that what you english speakers do? To me (a
native German speaker) it naturally was ``ed'' (like ``sam'').
As reference some Computerphile video is given, which is now
deleted. Is there a better source?

And what about the pronounciations of `ex' and `qed'?

What about `od'? (That I pronouce ``oh-dee''.)
