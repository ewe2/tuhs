If you look at the source, it is in the list that is checked for
printing (or not) the 'unsupported command' error message, but there is
no actual code to handle it (and when called *without* -n, it just falls
through and prints once, just like if you'd had no command at all)

https://git.busybox.net/busybox/plain/editors/sed.c?h=1_3_stable

I think that makes this a legitimate bug in busybox, rather than simply
an artifact of being a minimal tool that doesn't aim for posix (or
historical unix) conformance.
