If you were on some 300 baud dial up modem, ed made tons of sense.  You
had a mental picture of the file in your head, you didn't need to see
all of it in real time, that was wasteful.  ed let you see as much as
you needed and as little as was productive.  And it worked without 
termcap.  ed rocks, it's yet another little program that does what
it needs to do and no more.

ed was like a lot of stuff that Bell Labs did that dated back to the
days when getting a print out took a day or so.  pic(1) is a great
example of that.  I *love* pic because I can look at the input to
pic and I can see what it will look like.  xfig and friends are 
not so much.
