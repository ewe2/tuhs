​I've forgotten that factoid.   I remember running into issues with it
because the CMU 11/40E had special CSV/CRET ​

​microcode which we could not use on the 11/34.  I've forgotten all the
hacks we had associated with the system calls.

I do remember, when we moved the CS systems' to EE 11/34 have to unwind a
whole ton of that.   When tjk brought a UNIX/TS based kernel from MH to us
we had reintegrate.   I've forgotten all the details now, I just remember
many, many hours cleaning things up

When we did Magix for the the Tek Magonlia, we cheated and put zeros
there.  But as got smarter and better (like Masscomp and Stellar), we have
two versions of the C runtime - "production mode" and "development mode."
In one, we made sure there was a RO page of zeros @ location 0, so we
c​ould take the traps and try to clean things up.   If I recall correctly,
Bourne Shell and ADB were two of the worst offenders.  I also seem to
remember the original V7 library code was riddled with those bugs  ( in
particular I seem to remember that malloc/free code), which is why it was
such a problem - you own code could be clean, but you brought in a library
and got in trouble.

The other things for those days, that has not yet been brought up was the
famous "NUXI" problem.   The  PDP-11 byte swapping was idemic in the code.
  When the first ports to system that were not the same "endianess" came
about - you would find strange things in memory.
