I should have been more clear.  I'm not realliy convinced that
building distributed computing into the OS ala Plan 9 is viable from
the perspective of commercial success.  Of course, Plan 9 did it; but
it did it as a research system.

The problem is that if a particular company is convinced that they
want to use Yellow Pages as their directory service --- or maybe X.509
certificates as their authentication system, or maybe Apollo RPC is
the only RPC system for a particularly opinionated site administrator
--- and these prior biases disagree with the choices made by a
particular OS that had distributed computing services built in as a
core part of its functionality, that might be a reason for a
particular customer *not* to deploy a particular distributed OS.

Of course, this doesn't matter if you don't care if anyone uses it
after the paper(s) about said OS has been published.

There's nothing stopping researchers from creating other research OS's
that try to answer that question.  However, creating an entire new
local node OS from scratch is challenging[1], and then if you then
have to recreate new versions of Kerberos, an LDAP directory server,
etc., so they all of these functions can be tightly integrated into a
single distributed OS ala Plan 9, that seems to be a huge amount of
work, requiring a lot of graduate students to pull off.

It's unclear to me that Linux is blamed as the reason why researchers
have stopped asking questions outside of that model.  Why should Linux
have this effect when the presence of Unix didn't?

Or is the argument that it's Linux's fault that Plan 9 has apparently
failed to compete with it in the marketplace of ideas?  And arguably,
Plan 9 failed to make headway against Unix (and OSF/DCE, and Sun NFS,
etc.) in the early to mid 90's, which is well before Linux's became
popular, so that argument doesn't really make sense, either.
