Amen brother.  I refer to this as figuring out and understanding what
matters and what is really just window dressing.=E2=80=8B  That is much eas=
ier to
do after the fact and for those of us that lived UNIX, we spent a lot of
time defending it.  Many of the 'attacks' were from systems like VMS and
RSX that were thought to be more 'complete' or 'professional.'

=E2=80=8BHmmm. I'll accept X.500, but SMTP I always said was hardly 'simple=

although compared to what it replaced (FTPing files and remote execution)
is was.=E2=80=8B

=E2=80=8BI'll always describe it as having 'good taste.'  And part of 'good=
 taste'
is learning what really works and what really does not.=E2=80=8B  BTW: havi=
ng good
taste in one thing does necessarily give you license in another area.  And
I think that is a common issues.   "Hey were were successfully here, we
must be genius..."   Much of DEC's SW as good, but not all of it as an
example.  Or to pick on my own BSD expereince, sendmail is a great example
of something that solved a problem we had, but boy do I wish Eric had not
screwed the SMTP Daemon into it ....

=E2=80=8BExactly...   or as was said before:  *as simple as possible, but n=
ot
simpler.=E2=80=8B*

*=E2=80=8B  *But I like to add that understanding 'possible' is different f=
rom 'it
works.'* =E2=80=8B*
