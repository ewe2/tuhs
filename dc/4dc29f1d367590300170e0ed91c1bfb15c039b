Because of the design bug I mentioned, I searched for UNIX sources from AT&T 
that include streams support, but could never find any.

Sun fixed the bug aprox. one year after introducing SunOS-4.0. I am sure that 
if someone did use a streams based system written from the AT&T specs together 
with a modern shell with an integrated history editor, the character loss would 
have been detected.
