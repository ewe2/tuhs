Okay, while on the subject of SCCS and UNIX:

Is there a UNIX (post SCCS) like System III or System V that still has all =
of the original SCCS entries intact? =20

Would only production ready code be entered as an SCCS delta?=20

Or, would SCCS be used as a checkpoint tool to store unofficial versions (e=
ven broken versions) of the UNIX codebase as development progressed on the =
system as a whole?

I would love to see all of the prs for the kernel and commands. =20

Truly,

Bill Corcoran
