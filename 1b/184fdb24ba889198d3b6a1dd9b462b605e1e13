Actually, I think if you go back far enough (1930's), it was part of UCB,
back when Lawrence first started it.

And of course the DoE didn't exist until 1977, so during the early ARPANET
era if would have been under the AEC, and then I assume the Energy Research
and Development Administration after 1974 (I assume it didn't go with the NRC
when the AEC was split up).
