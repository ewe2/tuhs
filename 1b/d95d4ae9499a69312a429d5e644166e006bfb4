If you can find source for bind 4<=  I'm sure it will compile and give you
a working named. Getting the client side code cleanly would mean a later
release of BSD but there are client side libs in the bind code AFAIK. You
can possibly link against them for rational gethostbyname(). If the link
loader ordering thing works, they might supercede simply by placing
-lresolv before libc.

Bear in mind all the RR type richness postdated this time so you could be
sent UDP > 512, and internal state you can't grok. But for A and PTR lookup
it should be fine. Since it won't do TCP or DNSSEC or large packet EDNS0
signalling, I suspect a bit of dns flow inbound would be perplexing for the
resolver.
