Hello all!

Thanks Warren for accepting / inviting me!

Old timer of computing... Did and contributed the port of PGP 2.6.3i
to MIPS RC/3230 in 1993-1994 (cause I needed that to order a
Munititions T-Shirt from Adam Back).

Yeah... I was running crypto on my corporate server, in France, while
it was illegal. But I wanted the T-Shirt...

In effect, I can say "been there... done that... got the t-shirt" :)

Gilles
