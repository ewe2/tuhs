Subject: [TUHS] Portable Pascal and a 1BSD question
Message-ID: <A731853E-E882-430B-B38C-7F092E135C81@gmail.com>

Hi all,

In v2 no5 AUUGN Jun-Jul 1980, Andy Tanenbaum announced the availability of a Portable Pascal Compiler for the then proposed ISO standard. A tape was made for v6, v7, and non-unix platforms. Does anyone know if there is a tape image around that has the distro?

On a related note, has anyone successfully installed 1BSD on a v6 install running in SImH? 1BSD has the Berkeley Pascal Instructional system on it.

Regards,

Will
