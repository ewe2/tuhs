The people I'm talking about (who might be characterised as 'COBOL shops') are not early adopters: 20 years is about how long it takes for them to decide something is safe.  Yes, of course Linux has been everywhere for a long time, but ten years ago it almost certainly was not involved in running your bank account, while today it almost certainly is.

'Linux' and 'OS standardisation' are funny phrases to see in the same sentence.  (Note: I work in an exclusively Linux HPC environment: I am not some anti-Linux holdout, I just have previously worked in the above-mentioned environments and I appreciate their needs and fears).

I think this is probably off-topic tor TUHS, sorry.
