Yes. I saw Clem's mail just as I was about to recommend
placing a small dish of machine oil beside the simulator. 
Alas, it seems I missed out on the chad experience. Data was 
regularly imported to the PDP-7 by ppt, but rarely exported. 
Night-owl Ken must have taken some ppt backups, evidence of 
which the midnight janitors whisked away.
