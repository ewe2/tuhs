In that case, do you have any objections to me siccing the TUHS(The Unix 
Heritage Soc.)http://www.tuhs.org/ /PUPS(PDP11 Unix Preservation 
Soc.)http://minnie.tuhs.org/PUPS/ people on to it? 
 
It is something that interests us, and there'll be at least one list member 
within driving range of Cambridge, Mass., with plenty of time to examine the 
tape. 
 
I'll cc' this ove to those lists and let anyone who's interested, get in touch 
with you. 
 
Thanks heaps.
