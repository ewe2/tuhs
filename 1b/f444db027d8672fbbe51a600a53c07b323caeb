One of the more obscure books I have is about "the F programming language"
http://www.fortran.com/F/ which is the modern subset of Fortran 95. A
curious thing about F is that it doesn't include DO WHILE; my
understanding is that there was a faction of the Fortran standardization
committee which was firmly against WHILE, and that was the faction that
defined the F subset.

I can't now find any information about this argument / controversy, but my
link archive includes https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=800168.811545
Brenda Baker's paper on converting Fortran IV programs to ratfor.
