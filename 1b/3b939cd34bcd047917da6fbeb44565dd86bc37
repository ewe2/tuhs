I used the files from PDP-11/Distributions/ucb/2.11BSD/ in the collection
and built a tape image using a short perl script which I attached as
"mktap.pl".  I got the file format from the comments in the "mtdump"
program from the "simtools.zip" archive (on simh.trailing-edge.com), and
how to put the files onto the tape from the HOWTO file in the 2.11BSD
directory.  From there I pretty much just followed the HOWTO.

The system is mostly functional.  fsck still complains about a file that
it creates.  I stuck it all in one 128 meg file system, so I'm thinking of
making another disk and file system just to stick the fsck temporary file
on during boot.

I'm running it on a Linux 2.2 box.  My ethernet card is a 3c905B in case
it matters.  I have attached my startup file as "simh".

I am using simhv210-1.zip, which as I write this is still the latest one
on the site.

Any ideas to try?  Hve you had any luck?
