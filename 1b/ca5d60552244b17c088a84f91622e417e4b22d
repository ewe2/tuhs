I loved ^T on Unix! I remember when somebody at UMCP added that feature to our 4.2 BSD Vax mimsy. The early version had the fun side-effect of being unregulated. Who added the one-second delay between responding to ^T so you couldn’t any longer hold down ^T with auto-repeat to drive the CPU load through the ceiling and watch as it got higher and higher trying to respond to all those ^T's? (Does that qualify as a Heizenbug, or is that a denial of self service?)
