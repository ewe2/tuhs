I so agree with this.  Verbose comments suck.  Too many comments suck.
Why?  Because the code evolves and it's work to evolve the comments
as well.  Too many comments means they are not maintained and they 
become incorrect.

I *HATE* comments that are not correct, hate that so much that if you did
that we would talk, if you kept doing that, you are fired.  No comments
are MUCH better than incorrect comments.

Terseness in comments is good.  Comment where it is not obvious what
is going on.  And maintain the comments like you maintain the code.

I agree with Dan (I think) that coding is still a craft and getting the
comments right is one of the hardest things to master (and I agree that
Unix did it pretty darn well).  No comments suck, too much sucks, just
right is so darn pleasant.
