 |

 |>|That's absolutely false.  TeamWare, which is the productized version

 |>|were forced to use NSE.  It was awful.  I got into source management=20
 |>|because I was well known at Sun as the guy that could fix performance
 |>|problems so I was asked to look at NSE.  One look told me that I couldn=
't
 |>|fix NSE but the source management problem space needed some help.
 |
 |[1] The politics had to do with Teamware.  I wrote all the code in
 |NSElite, including smoosh(1) which was what the patent covered (though
 |the patent happened later).  Everyone in the kernel group were using
 |NSElite because NSE sucked so hard.  But it wasn't sanctioned code,
 |it was a Larry project.  Bill Shannon would walk around and tell people
 |that they couldn't use NSElite but they ignored him because it worked
 |and it was light years faster than NSE.
 |
 |They couldn't kill NSElite so they decided to toss it to an 8 person
 |team in the tools group.  They told me if I wanted to work on tools I
 |had to go join the tools group.  Yeah, right, I'm in the kernel group
 |and I'm going to take the 3 step downgrade to tools?  I don't think so.
 |
 |I just kept on supporting and developing NSElite, which was 90% perl4
 |and a xview graphical program to view history and smoosh (both C).
 |Because I was coding most of the stuff in (very stylized perl, I rewrote
 |it 3 times until I had code I could have a hope of maintaining), I was
 |much faster at rolling out new stuff.  In fact, the 8 people choose to
 |rewrite everything in C++ which meant I was coding circles around them.
 |Hence the politics, one guy, in his spare time, while doing a full time
 |job hacking the kernel, was making 8 guys look like idiots.  Evan later
 |wrote a paper about what a bad choice C++ was.
 |
 |Something had to give and Jon Kannegaard, who was the VP of the tools
 |group, walked into my office and said "I've got Scott's (McNealy, CEO)
 |approval on this.  If you make one more release of NSElite you are=20
 |fired."  Nice, eh?  Not everything was perfect at Sun.
 |
 |So I stopped, I left the kernel group and went over and did SPARC Clusters
 |for Ken Okin.  Glenn filed the patent after I left.
 |
 |It was a shame because NSElite didn't have changesets, it wasn't really
 |a distributed system (relied on NFS to get at remote repos), if I had
 |kept going it would have evolved into what BitKeeper bacame.
 |
 |Oh, yeah, the politics were so bad that when Evan took smoosh.c he
 |didn't take any of the SCCS history, he checked it in so it looked like
 |he wrote it.  Even Shannon called that dirty pool.

Thank you for this look into the Sun internals, the above sounds
manlike, and that in High-Tech!

Hm, he started running into this list for sure.  Since you guys
are there for several decades, who can tell in between the line
fluxes, me not.  All i know is that if you interview multiple
people on the same topic, then you will hear multiple stories,
practically always.  Transporting history by hearsay is what made
us great, wa.  I will never forget documentation of some natives
in the Indonesian djungle, the kings envoy only said that he is
exactly that, was scanned by many eyes, .. and accepted.
So even if J=C3=B6rg has a hearsay account on the Sun internals in
question, i cannot blame him for standing upon that ground.
