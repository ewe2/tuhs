One place I worked recently used FreeIPA.  It's a Redhat-sponsored =
attempt to integrate a bunch of other free/open source projects and put =
them under a single web UI.

It=E2=80=99s largely compatible, functionally, with Active Directory, =
and I think can be set up to support cross-realm authentication with an =
AD installation as well.  It *doesn=E2=80=99t* (or at least in the setup =
I used) replace AD, and doesn=E2=80=99t seem to use any Samba =
components.

It does however include the DHCP and (Dynamic)DNS integration that=E2=80=99=
s part of AD.

It seemed pretty fragile in practice, although the overall level of =
systems expertise in this place was fairly low, and a lot of its =
problems could well have been issues with the underlying virtual machine =
or storage infrastructure.

I too still use NIS at home.  It works with my Linux boxes, but also the =
Sun, DEC, SGI and NeXT stuff as well.  I like the idea of a central =
directory, but X.500 always seemed like overkill and the =
=E2=80=9CLightweight=E2=80=9D bit of LDAP doesn=E2=80=99t quite throw =
enough away for me =E2=80=A6
