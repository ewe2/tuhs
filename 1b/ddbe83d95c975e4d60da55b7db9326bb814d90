 |Indeed -- forgive my nostalgia here... We were developing a DOS-based 
 |PC-Card (often incorrectly called a PCMCIA card).  With OS/2, you opened 
 |up a DOS box. If the driver crashed, you just opened up another and went 
 |on.  Under Windoze, the whole box crashed (and sometimes took the 
 |file-system with it).  We used a combination of Eberhard Mattes' emx, 
 |the MKS toolkit, and case-sensitive file-systems to give us a reasonable 
 |approximation.

For a few holiday weeks i once worked in the IBM factory in Mainz
Germany in a hard disk production line clean room.  One of the
gauges were driven by OS/2 which not only catched my attention but
also crashed randomly up to several times per shift, causing
automatic reboots (reliably).  (The factory as such was not worth
it, it has been closed after fifty years, in the new Heiligkreuz
Viertel (holy-cross quarter) there have been build 242 flats and
a supermarket in the meantime.)

I liked 4DOS.
