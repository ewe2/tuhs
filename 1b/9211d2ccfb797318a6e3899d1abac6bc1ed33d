The 380 had a J11, the 350 had an F11.  I *believe* the 280 was
somewhere between an 11/73 and an 11/53, and the 350 was somewhat
like an 11/23.

Correct.

If memory serves me right, you had P/OS (a menu-driven branch of the
RT11 system), and Venix, a somewhat Unix-like system.  Given some
work, one should be able to get standard RT working on it.
