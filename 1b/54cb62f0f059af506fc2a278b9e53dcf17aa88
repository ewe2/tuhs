So I've been lame on this project, I want to be uwvax, need to step up.
I've been distracted because where I live has been hit with a crazy 
amount of rain, I have multiple landsides that have washed out roads
on just my property, the county has over 100 roads that are damaged 
or closed, and I've stepped up to help a bit:

It's gonna start raining again tomorrow which means I won't be patching roads
but I also help the fire department with downed trees (I used to run a tree
service in college) so maybe more distractions.

Anyhoo, is there a cheatsheet for dummies on how to get set up?
