Yup, that's what I get for trying to be clever.  :-)  I built and ran
maketape, and the 11/73 likes the resulting tape (boots).  So I'm remaking
the tape with the tar's on it (per the instructions).

I also happened to look at my work email, and saw the recent thread on this
same subject - doh!

Maybe we should add something to the /2.11BSD distribution README with the
caveats we've learned?  -- Ian
