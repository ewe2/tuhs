Derrick, if it's code from 32V, 7th Edition or earlier, then you are
covered by the new Caldera Ancient UNIX license, and you can release
binaries and/or source. If it's code from any of the BSDs, then you
are covered by a standard BSD license, except for the bits which
Caldera can trace as belonging to them 8-)

Cheers,
