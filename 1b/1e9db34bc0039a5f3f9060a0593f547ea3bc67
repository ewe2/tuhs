Hi Dave,

I don't think the author was an idiot;  things were different back then.
It's similar to Jordan Hubbard's rwall(1) mentioned here at the end of
September;  someone had to be the first to screw up.

He ended up a convicted felon, something I understand is quite serious
that side of the pond, that seems harsh, and it must have been quite
embarrassing for him given his father was Chief Scientist at NSA, having
moved on from Bell Labs:

Without that wake-up call, and the good that came out of it, e.g. CERT
funding, it might have been a more rude awakening with more than time
burnt?
