A working link to the ancient-Unix license exists at

  http://shop.caldera.com/caldera/ancient.html

This is a saved link; I didn't investigate how
to find it currently from a Caldera or SCO site.

In case anyone is interested, I retrieved
some fraction of the court papers from
the early 90s USL suit against BSDI and UCB.
The case seems in some ways similar to this
one.  They are at

In this one, USL pulled back after an injunction
was denied.  By the time the 1993 ruling was issued,
USL was being taken over by Novell.
