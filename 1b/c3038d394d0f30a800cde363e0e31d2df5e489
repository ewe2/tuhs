It depends on what you mean by the first "it" above - if you meant 'V6', then
no. From the Distribution V6's /src/mdec/fsboot.s:
		
  / read in path name
  / breaking on '/' into 14 ch names

The process of breaking the name up into segments, and then later finding
each name in the appropriate directory, can be seen. The code is kind of
obscure, but if you look at the RL bootstap I dis-assembled:

  http://ana-3.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/tech/unix/rlboot.s

it's pretty much the same code, and a little better commented in the 'read
in directories' part.
