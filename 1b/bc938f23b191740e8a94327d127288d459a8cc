Gah, the archive files from before 2002 are a nightmare.

My best guess on the proper message count is 8675. This is the number of
blocks of non-blank lines which either start with "From " (the easy
case) or, for the hard case, meet the following conditions:

In a file dated 2001 or earlier
First line contains a colon
Contains at least one line starting with "Received:"

There might still be a handful of messages this fails to split out. I
would recommend interpreting files dated October 2001 or later as a
strict MBOXO archive, and only doing special processing to files dated
September 2001 or earlier (I haven't factored out my own script to be
able to do anything other than count messages)
