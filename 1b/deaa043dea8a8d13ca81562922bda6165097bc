If the "more" is based on the "more xpg4" variant of the "more" source from 
SVr4, then it is closed source and the OSF, HP or IBM is preventing a 
redistribution.

Sun mentioned in 2005 that IBM was blocking the wish to make it OSS.

What I've heard from IBM at CeBIT is that IBM today would decide different.

But note that AT&T is (like Sun) only allowed to decide on code that only 
contains Copyright messages from AT&T and/or Sun.
