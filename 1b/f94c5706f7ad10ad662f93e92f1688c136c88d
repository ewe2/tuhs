I noticed that the TUHS archive does not include a 4.1BSD distribution.

Also, while poking around the net, I've found a number of purported
tape images of 4.1BSD dated 7/10/1981 that look to me to a little sketchy,
since most contain files dated well into 1982.

So it appears to me that 4.1BSD is semi-lost.

While googling all this, I discovered that the School of Computer Science
and Statistics at Trinity College Dublin has an online archive catalog
which lists a couple of 4.1BSD distribution tapes in the "John Gabriel Byrne
Computer Science Collection".

Perhaps someone from TUHS who lives near Dublin could investigate and
see if images can be made of these tapes?
