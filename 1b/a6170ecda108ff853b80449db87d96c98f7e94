Subject: [TUHS] V7 UNIX on VAX 11/750
Message-ID: <JEEJJGIHMMPINMGMPLGGOECICBAA.jwillis@coherent-logic.com>

Just noticed in the publication data for "The UNIX Programming Environment"
that
it was created on a VAX 11/750 running V7 UNIX. How is this possible? I have
an 11/750 and V7 is my favorite UNIX... if I could do this, it would be
awesome.

Anyone have any insights?
