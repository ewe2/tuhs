its based on TekInfo, whereas 'Tek' allegedly refers to the anachronistic Tape Editor and Corrector, developed by a student (Dan Murphy) in 1964 on a PDP-1 without a operation system. According to the myth TekInfo was build on top of the Tape Editor, and finally made it on *NIX.

'Info' really doesn't fit in well with Unix. Its alien and another failed approach. Almost all 'GNU' man pages state, that the 'full' documentation is only available via 'info'. In real 99% of all 'info' requests  result in 'info' processing a man page. Thus its redundant and should be removed from all *NIX systems. Even in emacs some progressive developers recommend to replace 'info' by html or something else modern.
