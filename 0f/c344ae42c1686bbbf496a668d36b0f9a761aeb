But if you look through at the FS code of everything until after Gobble
worked on 4.1 & did the reordering work,  unless you were careful with the
syncs, it was easy to have a corrupted FS.   Ted's fsck(1) program made
cleaned up of corrupted FS much easier.  But it was really ghg's work that
got the kernel right.   When Kirk's BSD FFS was done (aka UFS) and went
into 4.1A (maybe B) you needed the Purdue mods if you wanted to have a 4.1
or V7 that could reasonable survive a power hit without FS damage.

It funny, I still type: sync<cr>sync<cr>sync<cr> before I type reboot<cr>
 it was burned into the ROMs in the fingers so long ago.   My CS major
daughter once asked me my I type that ;-)
