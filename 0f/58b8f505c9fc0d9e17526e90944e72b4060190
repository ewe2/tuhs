It was a long time ago but it rankled at the time (and even came up in my
Bell Labs interview): that copyright notice replaced whatever was there
before. Code written and copyrighted by other institutions was absorbed
into the Berkeley distribution and reattributed without credit. Joy told me
later that the lawyers made them do it. He was probably telling the truth,
but that didn't make it OK.
