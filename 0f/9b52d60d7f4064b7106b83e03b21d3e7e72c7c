Not sure if any of the other shells have this. We're basically talking 
csh, sh and ksh unless I remember wrong.
But it's a good question. If noone else have tried it by tomorrow, I 
could check.

161324 is way high. This is in kernel mode, and that is in the I/O page. 
Basically no code lives in the I/O page (some boot roms and hardware 
diagnostics excepted). This smells like corrupted memory (pointer or 
stack), or something else very funny.

Like others said - the cpu error register is documented in the processor 
handbook.

020 means Unibus Timeout, which is consistent with trying to access 
something in the I/O page, where there is no device configured to 
respond to that address.

I just tried the same thing on a simh system here, and I do not get a 
crash. This on 2.11BSD at patch level 449, running on an emulated 11/94.

I do however get tcsh to crash.

simh:/home/bqt> su -
Password:
erase, kill ^U, intr ^C
# tcsh
simh:/# cat << EOF
Illegal instruction - core dumped
#
Suspended (tty input)
simh:/home/bqt>
simh:/home/bqt> cat /VERSION
Current Patch Level: 448
Date: January 5, 2010


Yes, it says patch level 448, but it really is 449. This was the system 
where I worked together with Steven when doing the 449 patch set, but I 
never got around to actually updating the VERSION file itself.

Also, this was while running on the console.



Could you (Walter) try the latest version of 2.11BSD and see if you 
still get that crash?
