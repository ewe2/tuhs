The ups debugger by Mark Russell of University of Kent. It used x11 or sunvi=
ew. IIRC it used a separate graphics library built directly on top of x11 (o=
r sunview) that provided variable scrolling etc. scrolling speed and directi=
on depended on the distance you dragged the mouse pointer from its initial p=
osition. You could click on any source like and add a break or custom code i=
n interpreted C. You could click on the data structure window and follow lin=
ked list structures etc. The last version was 3.38 in 2003. I don=E2=80=99t t=
hink it works with anything more modern than gcc3. The nicest debugger I eve=
r used.
