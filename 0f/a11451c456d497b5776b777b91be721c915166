That's awesome.  And finger, back in the days of innocence before scammers
and viruses and black hat hackers, was super useful.  I hacked my finger
server to do all sorts of stuff, it was sort of ftp/ps/who and who knows
what else in one.

I miss the days when finger was a thing.  Perhaps poorly named (perhaps
not), whatever, it was simpler time.
