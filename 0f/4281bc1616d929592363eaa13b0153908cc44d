I attended a lecture by Admiral Hopper ca. 1981 at DEC's software
engineering facility in Nashua NH.  She used the
micorsecond/nanosecond demonstration as part of a prediction of the
end of Moore's Law, and the eventual need for parallel processing to
make further gains in computing speed.  She drew another analogy:  in
the 19th century, if you wanted to haul a larger load, you didn't
breed bigger and bigger horses; you hitched up several horses as a
team.  She was quite the visionary.

She handed out nanoseconds as souvenirs after the talk.  I still treasure mine.
