Subject: [TUHS] Tenth Edition: /usr/include + get it running
Message-ID: <20170331220627.GA6506@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, I've just had an e-mail from someone to say that the two 10th Edition
versions we now have in the Unix Archive are missing /usr/include:

----- Forwarded message from someone -----
/usr/include is missing from both Dan's and Norman's archive. Here it
is (with a README). The timestamp on these files is:
-rw-r--r--   1 root  staff     307 Sep  3  1997 README
-rw-r--r--   1 root  staff  829440 Sep  3  1997 r70include.tar
----- End forwarded message -----

I've put these files into
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Norman_v10/

Now that we have 9th Edition up and running, it would be good to see 10th
Edition also up and running. I know there are people out there who can
help with this, so this is a call out for help and for volunteers.

Cheers, Warren
