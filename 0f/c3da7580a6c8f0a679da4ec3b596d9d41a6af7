If the SQL prompt example did not clarify you are welcome to go one on
one if this is something you think is curious to you, I think I've
explained the point I was making adequately for a general audience.

Reason through what happens in a shell pipeline, the more detail the
better.  A quick nudge is fork/exec, what happens in the kernel, what
happens in page tables, what happens at the buffered output, tty layer
etc.  Very few people actually understand all these steps even at a
general level in modern systems.

If you had a grocery list on a piece of paper would you
a) count the lines or read it directly off the last line number on the
paper if it is numbered

b) copy each character letter by letter to a new piece of equipment
(say, a word processor), until you encounter a special character that
happens to be represented as a space on the screen, increment a
counter, repeat until you reach another special character, output the
result and then destroy and throw away both the list and the word
processor equipment.

This kind of thing doesn't really matter in the small or at all for
performance because computers are fast.  But most programming bugs in
the large eventually boil down to some kind of misunderstanding where
the representation was lost and recast in a way that does not make
sense.

Kevin
