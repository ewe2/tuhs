Partitioning the tree sure seems like it would lead to a bad day, doesn't i=
t?

I expect the undocumented arcana related to linking directories was
always an escape hatch for a skilled administrator to rescue a sick
system. One can imagine any number of ways in which directory files
could be corrupted; sufficient inspection of disk contents might give
someone with the requisite low-level knowledge sufficient information
that they could, say, reattach a pruned subtree with clever uses of
`ln -f` and `unlink`. Did `icheck` and friends have something
analogous to the `lost+found` directory created by `fsck`? I could
imagine (somewhat painfully) executing those commands while in
single-user mode on the console.
