Arnold -- sounds fun.  Thank you!!!  I'll add it to my growing pile of
things I want to play with at some point.   I too had a wonderful childhood
experience with the SW tools.  Somebody had a number of them running on a
VMS box when all we had was the VMS Fortran compiler, no C yet.

I am curious why did you decide to use byacc?   I would have thought in a
desire to modernize and make it more available on a modern system -- was
there something in byacc that could not be done easily in bison?   To be
honest, I had thought Robert Corbett did them both and bison was the
successor to byacc, but I'm not a compiler guy - so I'm suspecting that
there must be a difference/reason.   As I said, this is purely curiosity --
an educational opportunity.

Thanks again,
Clem
