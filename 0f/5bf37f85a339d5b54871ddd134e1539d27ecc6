I occasionally tweet pointers to archived messages when I see a gem in 
our list that merits wider dissemination.  I did so this week: "The 
reasons AT&T's CEO and legal started using Unix are not the ones you'd 
expect. http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2016-December/007519.html"

If you'd prefer to keep this list less public I can avoid such posts.
