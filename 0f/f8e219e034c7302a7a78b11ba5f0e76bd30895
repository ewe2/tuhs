Hmmm, I cannot exactly answer that, but the PDP-7 and PDP-9 were both
18-bit machines, and somewhat compatible, I believe.
The whole line is (I believe):

PDP-4 -> PDP-7 -> PDP-9 -> PDP-15

So I guess that if you had it running on a PDP-7, you could probably
almost take the code unmodified and run it on the PDP-9.
The PDP-15 have a different bus (Unibus?) I believe, and thus,
peripherials are different from the predecessors.
This obviosuly affects the OS. :-)
