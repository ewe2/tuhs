Thanks again!
Do you have a bibliography or list of all the papers and books you have 
in that collection?

I have a very very long list of things I am looking for, such as:

- "The Conversion of U.C. Berkeley Time Sharing Systems to UNIX Version 
Seven" by Bob Kridle 1981;

- various Unix News 1975-1976;

- more 1970's Western Electric licensing examples; Univ. of California / 
Berkeley; Univ. of Toronto, or any other 1970's "Unix" licenses. (An 
example I am looking for is AT&T/USL vs. BSDI/Univ. of California June 
1992 complaint Exhibit F "32V Software Agreement" dated April 1, 1979 
(or Exhibit B to the DeFazio Affidavit)? (See 920724.complaint.txt and 
more details in 930107.amicus.txt and 930108.oppose.txt.)  Or maybe the 
1981 relicense?

- 1970's release announcements of any Unix or any Berkeley Unix related 
software (like Berkeley Pascal)

- "PWB/Unix overview and synopsis of facilities" 1977 by Dolotta and 
Haight;

- M. Nielsen, "SUN Student Workstation System Overview" Computer 
Science Department, Stanford Univ. 1981

- Shannon and Lyon's paper "4.2BSD on the Sun Workstation (or What we 
Did on our Summer Vacation)(or How to Emulate a VAX on a 68000)" from 
Winter 1983 Usenix/Unicom?  (Sure seems like I found this but don't see 
now.)

- BBN QTR "Combined Quarterly Technical Report" 18, 21, 22, 25, 28

Maybe we should make a TUHS wiki page of documents we are looking for? 
(Or maybe there already is?)
