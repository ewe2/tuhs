Thoth Thucks ....


Actually to give Mike Malcom created Thoth ney QNX was very slick.  I agree with Larry. It was very impressive at the time.  So between Thoth (which was Unix-similar) and Minix (which was V7 Unix API clone) I think it is safe to say there are reasonable existance proofs for saying V7 was quite possible on the 8086/8088 family.
