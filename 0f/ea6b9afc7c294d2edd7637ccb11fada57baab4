I've successfully debugged analogous modern code longline with smart
people by judicious use of valgrind. Never underestimate the power of
sending them current source, and running a tool against it with good
diagnostic. Its probable that electric fence would have got there too,
but this method worked for the person in question (event driven code,
C++, linked to the libevent library, lots of malloc/free)

It was quite entertaining for me to do this because back in the 80s
when I worked at Leeds university I had to run student debug clinic,
and the litany was "bring me a fresh listing" which got rid of 3/4 of
the problems up front. So here I am, debugging and the moral
equivalent is "send me a link to the checked in code repository in
github, and valgrind output, and I'll find the problem". I am pretty
sure some of the problems vanished once I got code up to date, before
sending it in.
