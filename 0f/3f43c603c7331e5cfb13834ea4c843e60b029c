There's just no way that there were, as you claimed, programmers who were
willing to quit if it was BSD.  BSD was fine, there are other good choices
but BSD was fine.  What the video showed is there were programmers who were
willing to quit if was the GPL, which is the opposite of what you have so
stridently claimed.

That makes sense to me, the GPL was hated inside of Sun, it was considered 
a virus.  The idea that you used a tiny bit of GPLed code and then everything
else is GPLed was viewed as highway robbery.
