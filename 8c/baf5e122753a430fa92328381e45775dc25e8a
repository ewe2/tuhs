That's easy to answer, recalling some of the burnt and frayed edges of the Good
Old Days ;-)

The question "what *is* UNIX?" was a popular *philosophical* question at the
time, even among people who used UNIX and knew it well, because there were so
many incompatible variants, even on the same hardware, that called themselves
UNIX.

That problem was one of the drivers of the whole Software Tools movement, as I
recall.  ST, including VOS, was viewed as a way of addressing the compatibility
problem, regardless of whether the underlying "real" OS claimed to be UNIX,
UNIX-compatible, UNIX-like, or none-of-the-above.
