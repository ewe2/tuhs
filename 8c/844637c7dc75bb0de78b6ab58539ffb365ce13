Fascinating - thank you.

Have you figured out that path from here to the SVR4 code base that was
used for the x86 [which I think also went through a few more generations
after the SVR4 release]?

I did not have a lot of time to work on documenting the evolution of paging=
 / virtual memory code in 32V, Sys III and early SysV in the past months, b=
ut I did get some more background information that seems worth sharing.<br>
<br>
My understanding of the virtual memory story at USG is now as follows:<br>
<br>
Somewhere in 1981/82 a project plan for Unix 5 / System V was made and evol=
ving John Reiser=E2=80=99s virtual memory code for 32V-r3 was part of that =
plan. =E2=80=9CEvolving=E2=80=9D in this context meant making it more maint=
ainable and more hardware independent. John=E2=80=99s code assumed a memory=
 page, a disk block and a file block all to be the same size, and it needed=
 to be more general. It was also designed around the VAX MMU and this too n=
eeded to be generalised. The person assigned to that job was Bob (Robert) B=
aron, reporting to Tom Raleigh. The project involved quite a bit of re-arch=
itecting and progress was slowish. On top of that Bob left for CMU to work =
on Mach. Tom Raleigh tried to pick up where Bob had left off, but progress =
remained slowish.<br>
<br>
In parallel, Keith Kelleman and Steve Burroff were working on Unix for the =
3B20 Unix. They did paging code from scratch around the 3B20 MMU (which use=
d a more or less =E2=80=98modern=E2=80=99 page table design) and developed =
their idea for the =E2=80=9Cregions=E2=80=9D abstraction to support large, =
non-contiguous address spaces. It seems that they built on the main working=
 set ideas/concepts in the Reiser/Baron/Raleigh code base, combined these w=
ith their =E2=80=9Cregions=E2=80=9D idea, made it multi-processor capable a=
nd made it all work on the 3B20. Around that time Tom Raleigh seems to have=
 transferred to Bellcore, and the VAX code base got orphaned.<br>
<br>
Two young engineers appear to have picked up the work on the VAX code base:=
 Dean Jagels and Jim McCormick. My understanding is that they essentially b=
ack ported the 3B20 work to the VAX, falling back on the Reiser/Baron/Ralei=
gh work where necessary. They got it working, and as far as I can tell, thi=
s is what got released in 1984 as part of SysV R2.4 for the VAX (the oldest=
 surviving source code for this that I could find).<br>
<br>
This somewhat tortuous birth may in part explain why Research chose to use =
the 4BSD virtual memory code for 8th edition.<br>
