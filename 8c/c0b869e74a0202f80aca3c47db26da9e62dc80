Copyright notices don't tell the whole story.  They aren't required
for new code (and Sys V is mostly new enough, unlike Unix V32) after
the Berne enabling legislation.  And when they are transferred, the
old references aren't magically altered.

: groklaw.net has most of the info and analysis.

However, in this case, the bulk of the evidence is that Novell
retained the copyrights.  To transfer a copyright, one must
do so specifically, explicitly and in writing.  At best there's an
implication that Novell is obligated to transfer the copyright, but
even that's a stretch.
