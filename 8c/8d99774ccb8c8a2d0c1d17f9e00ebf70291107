We build source management systems and we still drop into assembler for
some stuff.  For example, we want to give ourselves a stack traceback
when something dies.  Another example is inner loops that are performance
critical, we stare at the assembler.

I don't expect the world to suddenly sit up and decide that it is important
to do what I want and give me my 64 bit PDP-11, but if that happened I'd
cheer :)

I think part of it is a yearning for simpler times.  That architecture 
was just so pleasant, you could move quite easily from C to assembler
and back again.  If I had to teach CS these days I'd prefer that 
assembler (but actually using it would be a disservice to the kids,
you want them to know x86 or ARM at this point).
