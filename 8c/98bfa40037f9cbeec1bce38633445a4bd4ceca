There's no reason any of that has to be implemented with primitives
though. All of that could be implemented on top of normal file APIs
fairly easily.

Also, sockets are not the ideal interface for a window server IMO. The
only reason they are used is because conventional Unix didn't provide
user-mode file server support until fairly recently (and the support
that's been added to more recent conventional Unices is a hack that
has poor performance and isn't used all that much).
