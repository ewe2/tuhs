All,
	I just received this e-mail. I have no idea who Wendy is, but
perhaps the things she has stashed away may be of some interest to you.

In my quest to get the house clean so I can get out, I
decided to inventory the computer stuff.  It's like
inventory by the technologically blind!  I got just so
far before I got frustrated and gave up.  

Pat and Rob took the sillyscope (with the intention of
selling it, I believe) and the RT, I think it was
called (to keep for my ex-).  

Dworkin took the PDP-11/73.  I asked him for $84
because that's what I need to keep Xcel from shutting
off my electricity, but he chose to give me a check
for $500, which I have not cashed and won't until he's
had the stuff long enough to ascertain that it works
and tell me so, or for two weeks, whichever comes
first.

That leaves:
(Note: sizes are eyeballed by someone with a lousy
eye)
IN THE GARAGE:
     various cables, keyboards, mouses, plugs,
cabinets, broken TVs, VCRs, and a Laser disk player,
and miscellaneous hardware
     a box about 1'x1.5'x2' with a 3.5" and a 5.25"
drive, and seven flat buttons with colored lights and
symbols, like turtles, rabbits, and lightning bolts.
     an Alpha Micro 1000E
     Raster Tech monitor
     D-SCAN, an 8"x8"x1" board with 17 female cable
plugs in three rows labeled "In" "Out" and "CH", six
columns labeled "R G B H V C"
     a 3'x3'x2' dec RXO2 and RLO2
     exposure timer & power supply unit
     Sharp electric typewriter, and another electric
typewriter up too high for me to read anything off it.
     a couple of Apple II+s  (Dad wants to keep one as
he has some information on a 5.25" floppy formatted
for that computer)
     SCM152 dry copier
     microfiche reader ?
     Kennedy model 9300 tape drive
     AlphaWrite documentation, and several 3-ring
binders of documentation I just didn't feel like
thumbing through for particulars right now (but can
later, if you like)
     and the infamous 78 2'x2' floor tiles.  (Dworkin
said he's seen them advertised for $9 apiece, new. 
They're not quite in new condition, but that gives a
ballpark for what they ought to be worth)

I didn't check IN THE LOFT, because it's too high for
me to reach or see.

IN THE FURNACE ROOM: I saw
     an Amdex 300A video monitor
     NEC multisync 2A monitor
     Raster Tech monitor
     ADDS (?) monitor
     and at least one other monitor with no words I
could identify
     An okidata printer
     an ALPS ALQ200 printer
     an IBM selectric II typewriter
     a Minolta fax 261
     and a "stack" -- y'know, a computer, with two
3.5" and one 5.25" floppy drives and buttons that said
"turbo" and "reset", but no brand name I could make
out.

IN THE CAVE: there remains
     a Scientific Atlanta receiver
     IBM monitor
     IBM 3.5" floppy drive
     HP LaserJet printer
     Smith-Corona electric typewriter
     Data south DS 150 printer
     Microscience International Corporation thing that
says it has 7 heads and 855 cylinders, but won't tell
me what it uses them for
     digital h3350; I don't know what it is, but it's
the size of a deck of cards
     a couple of EMLock security door thingies
(magnetic)
    various boards (green things with solder and
little batteries and stuff on them)
     a couple of Alpha Micro video cassettes

That's what I had the energy to see.  Can you
enlighten me as to what these things are and what
ought to be done with them?  I can't even get at the
other stuff in the furnace room/garage until some of
it gets moved.
