Maybe 8748.  There was a mask version of this in the PC keyboard
controller (and hence still buried in most if not all southbridges).
That was followed by the 8051 family (8751 would have been the EPROM
version) - which I believe was very popular in car ECUs.  It was also
multi-sourced.  I've used both i8748 and a Philips 8051 clone at $work
many years ago.

For various reasons, I never learnt 6502.  I preferred the Motorola CPUs
(though $work was very Intel based).
