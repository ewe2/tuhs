Just so.

The constraints are pretty tight.  The GBA has 32K of on-chip RAM and 256K
of off-chip RAM.  Cartridges have 32M of ROM, so the system disk is stored
in ROM with a shadow overlay in RAM.  In any case there is no keyboard
or other character input device: all it can do is run a preprogrammed
set of commands in the shell.  So running an ancyent Unixe on SIMH makes
a lot of sense, since the device can never be anything practical.
