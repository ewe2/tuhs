The assembler could handle 8 case independent symbols.   C prepended an underscore to avoid any symbol conflicts.    If I recall the compiler allowed longer symbols but it just lost those letters after 7.

Amusingly an early IBM 370 compiler omitted prepending the underscore which lead to hilarity when you declared variables called things like R15.
