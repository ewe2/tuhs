I=E2=80=99d like to add the constraint of things that would have been =
implementable
on the hardware of the late 1970=E2=80=99s, let=E2=80=99s say a PDP11/70 =
with Datakit or
3Mbps Ethernet or Arpanet; maybe also Apple 2 class bitmap graphics.

And quote some other posts:

I would argue that quite a bit of that was implementable as early as 6th
Edition. I was researching that very topic last Spring [1] and back =
ported
Peter Weinberger=E2=80=99s File System Switch (FSS) from 8th to 6th =
Edition; the
switch itself bloats the kernel by about half a kilobyte. I think it may =
be
one of the few imaginable extensions that do not dilute the incredible
bang/buck ratio of the V6 kernel.

With that change in place a lot of other things become possible:
- a Kilian style procfs
- a Weinberger style network FS
- a text/file based ioctl
- a clean approach to named pipes
- a different starting point to sockets

Each of these would add to kernel size of course, hence I=E2=80=99m =
thinking about
a split I/D kernel.

To some extent it is surprising that the FSS did not happen around 1975, =
as
many ideas around it were 'in the air' at the time (Heinz Lycklama=E2=80=99=
s peripheral
Unix, the Spider network Filestore, Rand ports, Arpanet Unix, etc). With =
the
benefit of hindsight, it isn=E2=80=99t a great code leap from the cdev =
switch to the
FSS - but probably the ex ante conceptual leap was just too big at the =
time.
