The MACRO-10 assembler used a keyword ASCIIZ to store that 
7-bit/1-bit-wasted ASCII format.

MOVEI 0,[ASCIIZ /Hello there
/]

for example. It was the defacto standard for null-terminated ASCII strings.

When I later moved to C on 8/16-bit computers, I remember thinking 
"what's with this signed 8-bit char thing?" ;)

There was also SIXBIT - almost everything ASCII had, but only upper 
case. The filesystem used that for filenames and extensions, and it was 
used in a few other areas. So any library calls like open() would have 
had to convert the ASCII filename to SIXBIT before doing any monitor calls.
