Are you thinking of the cu (call unix) command? But that was included in v7,
and don't think it was part of uucp. The escape was  ~   So a ~. to hangup,
~%put to send a file to the remote and ~%take to get one, and  ~~ to send a ~

later on, there was a ct (call terminal) command, expecting a terminal at the end
of phone line instead of another machine.
