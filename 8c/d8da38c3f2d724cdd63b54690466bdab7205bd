Thank you for reminding me of these.=20

On a substrate with a unified buffer cache and copy-on-write, =
vread/vwrite would have been very close to regular read/write and maybe =
could have been subsumed into them, using flags to open() as the =
differentiator. The user discernible effect would have been the =
alignment requirement on the buffer argument.

John Reiser wrote that he "fretted=E2=80=9D over adding a 6 argument =
system call. Perhaps he was considering something like the above as the =
alternative, I never asked.

I looked at the archives and vread/vwrite were introduced with 3BSD, =
present in 4BSD but marked deprecated, and absent from 4.1BSD. This =
short lifetime suggests that using vread and vwrite wasn=E2=80=99t =
entirely satisfactory in 1980/81 practice. Maybe the issue was that =
there was no good way to deallocate the buffer after use.
