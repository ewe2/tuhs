I should clarify, these are two separate comments. Ctrl-? did *not*
generate DEL on physical terminals (which typically had a dedicated key
for it), from the documentation that I've read it seems those that
allowed the combination at all tended to generate ^_. Which is something
that persists in modern terminal emulators for Ctrl-/, though I think
some do support Ctrl-? as DEL.
