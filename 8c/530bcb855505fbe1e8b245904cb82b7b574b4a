I think it is this one: http://bitsavers.org/pdf/regnecentralen/RC_4000_Refe=
rence_Manual_Jun69.pdf

Along these lines, at least one of Fujitsu=E2=80=99s high end network switch=
es was described using PowerPoint slides. At one point while working for the=
m I felt a software simulator of the switch would really help with testing s=
witch software. So I started developing one on my own. That is when I discov=
ered these slides were not only very detailed but also very accurate and qui=
te clear. They answered every question I had during the development. I have n=
ever seen such /engineering/ use of PowerPoint anywhere else.
