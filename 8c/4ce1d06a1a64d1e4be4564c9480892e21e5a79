This should work.

Well, every time I need to do this, I do some history reenactment, as this is
how Quasijarus Project was originally bootstrapped. I first install Ultrix on
the VAX, then write a Tahoe/Quasijarus disk label to the boot disk (by
compiling disklabel under Ultrix), and then do the normal 4.3-QJ0a install, at
which point the standalone system sees the label and is happy.
