    I was looking through the old archives at the old UNIX Dennis Ritchie
submitted. I would like to know how to boot this. I can't seem to compile
the PDP emulator(s) with djgpp or a non-linux system. I can with my linux.
Dennis said this version of unix was compiled with assembly, then into C if
I'm not mistaken. Now the PDPs they were the machines with no monitors just
printer tty type output correct?
