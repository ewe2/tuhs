Subject: [Unix-jun72] login prompt!
Message-ID: <Pine.BSI.4.64.0805021721570.20114@malasada.lava.net>

The tape I made earlier didnt properly preserve the permissions so
booting failed to exec /etc/init (had no exec bit set).  I fixed
my tape builder to get the permissions from the old Readme file
and regenerated a tape..

The good news:  login prompt!
I just built rf0 in the usual way, then rebuilt a warm kernel and
booted it.
