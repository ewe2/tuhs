Semi-related thought, possibly helpful: Did the manuals (I mean the
printed ones) have indexes that were meaningful for such purposes? I'm
thinking something like the output of apropos / man -k, not just a
listing of command names and page numbers.

Sure knowing that the description for how to use ls was in section 1
page 42 might have been _helpful_, but not really for finding out _how
to list files_ in the first place...
