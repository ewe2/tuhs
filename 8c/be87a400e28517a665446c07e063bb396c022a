Yes, that's in mine too.  I just thought the "slim book" had slightly
more in it, but perhaps that's because it has smaller pages, and
therefore the artice is spread over more of them.  I think our library
has a copy of the BSTJ, so I can check.

Someone emailed me off-list with a URL for an HTML-ised version;
thanks, but I have a real 7th Edition Manual with that paper, as well
as the troff source on my (original) 7th Edition distro.
