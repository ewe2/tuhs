Once upon a time there was a Soviet home computer that was based on the =
PDP-11, the BK0010:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronika_BK

(it is actually mostly a copy of the Terak 8510a -- =
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terak_8510/a )

The guy that found the surviving floppy with LSX source code (Leonid =
Broukhis) for the PDP-11 immediately ported it to the BK0010 and created =
a fair amount of infrastructure around it:

https://github.com/ignusius/bkunix

He used the 2.11BSD toolchain to create a cross-compiler. As that =
compiler had progressed significantly from the 5th Edition era compiler, =
the kernel became smaller and he could squeeze some stripped =
functionality back in. The repo says that the code there still works on =
a normal PDP-11.

I=E2=80=99ve never communicated with Leonid, but maybe Warren has =
contact details for him. Also, the person who created LSX unix (Heinz =
Lycklama) is reading this list -- but of course it has been 40+ years =
since he last touched the code.

Note that LSX only holds one process in core and swaps other processes =
(NPROC =3D 3) out to floppy. It reportedly took several hours for the =
Terak to self-compile LSX from source. At one point I added debugger =
support to my own port of LSX to a TI-990 with just floppies ... let=E2=80=
=99s just say, now I understand deeply why the original Unix debug =
interface was an improvement opportunity :^)
