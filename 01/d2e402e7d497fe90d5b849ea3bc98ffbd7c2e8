Ugh; that "I" ought to be "|" (and I can see other typos), so someone 
really needs to proofread those PDF scans if they're going to be regarded 
as authoritative.  Yes, I can help...

Indeed, when a lot of compilers recognised the Sieve of Eratosthenes being 
used and optimised for it...  Wasn't all that long ago that vehicle 
manufacturers also started doing the same thing :-)

The WICAT 150 was just a terminal with several serial ports, and was 
p*ss-awful (I worked for Lionel Singer, and had to support the poxy 
thing); I'm surprised that it beat another box, though...

Yep; extra work for the CPU.  Not much of a benchmark these days, as CPUs 
are really fast; when I was supporting Unify I used to use its automatic 
tutorial as a benchmark, and I used to joke that I needed a calendar on 
some boxes...

Trivia: Lionel Singer also sold the then-new Sun-3, and we had one set up 
at an AUUG conference, giggling whenever someone tried that benchmark; 
what they didn't know was that the prominent window was actually an 
"rlogin" to the Gould that we also sold...  The looks on their faces were 
priceless :-)
