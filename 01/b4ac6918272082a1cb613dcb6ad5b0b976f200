Dave Horsfall <dave at horsfall.org> posts a note today about the 14th
anniversary of the death of Claude Shannon on 24 February 2001.

Readers can find an extensive bibliography of his works, and
publications by others about him or his works, here:

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/bibnet/authors/s/shannon-claude-elwood.bib
	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/bibnet/authors/s/shannon-claude-elwood.html

They look identical on the screen, but the first is needed for BibTeX use,
and the second has live hyperlinks.

Notices to me of omissions, errata, etc., in the bibliography archives
are always welcome.
