I should mention that "at rl0 ..." also doesn't work:

I'm trying to boot the image v7_rl02_1145 from sim_2.3d, and get:

PDP-11 simulator V2.3d
sim> at rl02 /users/vandys/tmp/v7/v7_rl02_1145
sim> b rl02
@

I can type things to the '@' prompt, but it never does anything unless I
type '/', at which point it bombs back to the emulator.  My scan of the
documentation for bootstraps doesn't point out any state with an '@'
prompt... help?

I can't tell you how many years it's been since I've had access to an '11
running V7.  Looking forward to it!

Thanks,
Andy Valencia

At the bottom of simh_doc.txt in the Supnik emulator sources, it says:

UNIX V7 is contained on a single RL02 disk image.  To boot UNIX:

        sim> set cpu 18b
        sim> set rl0 RL02
        sim> att rl0 unix_v7_rl.dsk
        sim> boot rl0
        @boot
        New Boot, known devices are hp ht rk rl rp tm vt
        : rl(0,0)rl2unix
        # 

A smaller image is contained on a single RK05 disk image.  To boot UNIX:

        sim> set cpu 18b
        sim> att rk0 unix_v7_rk.dsk
        sim> boot rk0
        @boot
        New Boot, known devices are hp ht rk rl rp tm vt
        : rk(0,0)rkunix
        # STTY -LCASE
        #

Hope this helps!

Cheers,
