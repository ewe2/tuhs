And Coherent!

No, SCO has lost it, and lost all chance of ever regaining the trust of anyone 
with the barest skerrick of knowledge of Unix history.

I checked out an interesting web site:
http://www.robotwisdom.com/linux/nonnix.html
I had no idea that cloning Unix had gotten off to such an early start - Idris 
from Plauger et al., Cromix from Cromemco, Yourdon's Omnix, Oasis, etc.

SCO hasn't got a leg to stand on - on the other hand, are those toenails I see 
stuck in its teeth?
