It's downloaded.

I would suggest renaming it to something like 32V-x86, though - makes it 
easier to remember it's not going to be precisely the same as 32V for VAX.

In relation to corporate caveats, the only way you could actually compete with 
HP is if somehow, in a matter of months, you redid the entire development of 
BSD and SVRx, up to the stage HP-UX currently is at.

Oh well, time for me to brush off my Pajari book on Unix device drivers and 
see if I can make the grade! ;)
