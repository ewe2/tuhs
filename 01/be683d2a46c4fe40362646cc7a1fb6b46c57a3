Subject: [TUHS] SVR4 x86 -- Sources
Message-ID: <1310380205.2145.7.camel@localhost.localdomain>

 Hi,

 I'm currently reading J. Lion's commentary of Unix Code Level Six.  It
is the most useful commentary to operating system kernel I have ever
read.

 It would be really useful to also have the source code of SVR4 kernel
for Intel x86.  Does anyone have that?
