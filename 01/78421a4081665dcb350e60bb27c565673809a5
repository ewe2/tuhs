XENIX was a UNIX variant developed by Microsoft along with Logica
and The Santa Cruz Operation.

It was originally based on V7 and subsequently picked up bits of System III
and System V through System V Release 2.

It ran on PDP-11 (earliest verion only), Motorola 68k, Intel 8086 / 
80286 / 80386
and Nat Semi 32000 (not sure if that version was ever released though).

On Intel platforms it appeared as both an OEM offering from companies 
such as
Intel and IBM, and as a shrink wrapped end-user product from SCO.

The Linux kernel, by contrast, was developed from scratch and while it 
implements the
UNIX system calls and interfaces it has no other relation to the 
original AT&T UNIX
line.
