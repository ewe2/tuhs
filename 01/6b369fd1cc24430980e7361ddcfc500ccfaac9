Well, it looks like this was released before I had a chance to finish my 
32v port, not that I was working very hard on it.  I have a boot and 
memory disk driver working, but haven't started the real device drivers 
working yet.

For what it's worth, I started the project with a port of the ACK 
compiler.  It may be useful.  You can find it at 
ftp://opensourcedepot.com/minix/cross/minix-cross-0.1.tar.gz.  There 
also some of my early work at ftp://opensourcedepot.com/32V.

I did get a chance to play with v7/x86 in Bochs.  Looks pretty good.  
Any plans for the future?

Pat
