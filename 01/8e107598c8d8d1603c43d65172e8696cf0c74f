maybe the word browser is not really correct, it's ENQUIRE that I meant, 
which is the great-grandfather of that browser.

that's what I understood, the monitor was not really "part" of the 
computer, more like an external device controlled by it.

And yes, it included the funny desk (altough the wooden "arms" were 
broken off). It seemed complete (SCSI, CPU, 16MB RAM, 3-board Ethernet 
etc. was all there, even a spare powersupply, only the front plate was 
apparently missing), but it was halfways disassembled, and lacking any 
software or other knowledge and time to investigate, I never dared to 
turn it on.

It's a shame to let such a machine rot in storage, the museum is a much 
better place for that machine, and it's not as if it's "gone" now, I can 
visit it even more often than when I had it in storage ;)

yeah, that's it, although my machine looked smaller (half as wide)
