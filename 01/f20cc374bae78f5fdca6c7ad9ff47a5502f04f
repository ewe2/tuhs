My very fuzzy memory would put MERT at v4 or v5.  I think that the department
had an 11/40 running v3 back when it was in building 2.  I recall a much bigger
machine, I think an 11/70, after the move to building 6.  I think that Heinz's
office was across the hall from the room that had the 516 and the SS1, the 11/70
was across the hall and left a couple of doors from Heinz's office.  I'm pretty
sure that I used that machine to do the docs for the IC test system since the
department that I was in then didn't have a UNIX system.  I do have a v6 manual
from back then so that's where things were at the end of my time there.  Anyway,
from a timing thing I'm guessing that MERT was v4 or v5.
