I just discovered that Kirk McKusick has made a new DVD that covers a =
much broader set of software than his earlier 4 CD set:
https://www.mckusick.com/csrg/
(see bottom of the page, one but last paragraph).

This new DVD includes the surviving BBN VAX TCP source code; it is not =
on the earlier 4 CD set.
