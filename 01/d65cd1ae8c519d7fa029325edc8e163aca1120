: I've just tried to list a FreeBSD 7.2 dump on NetBSD 5.0.1:
: 
:   Extract directories from tape
:   Mangled directory: reclen less than DIRSIZ (12 < 16)
:   (many repetitions)
:   Mangled directory: reclen less than DIRSIZ (12 < 16)
:   . is not on the tape
:   Root directory is not on tape
:   abort? [yn] y

Actually, dump *IS* compatible between major releases of FreeBSD.  The
problem is that dump tapes from FreeBSD 1.x and 2.x (and 4.3BSD,
4.4BSD and early SunOS) are no longer restoreable because the code
that restored the old-style ufs1 layout was removed somewhere around
FreeBSD 4.x or 5.x.

It used to be the case that dump was completely interchangeable
between the different BSDs, but software drift has rendered that not
the case anymore.
