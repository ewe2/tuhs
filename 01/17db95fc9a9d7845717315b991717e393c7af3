Makes a lot of sense. I just fired up my Consensys SVR4.2 VirtualBox 
guest, and sure enough, neither the sticky bit, nor setgid work on 
directories.

My first commercial experience with UNIX as a consultant was SunOS. I 
had worked on Version 6 earlier, but that was purely personal and never 
more than messing around with a uVAX a friend had brought home from work.
