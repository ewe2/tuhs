Well, I borrowed the PDP-11 instruction simulaton code from Eric Edwards,
and spent most of my time on emulating the syscalls, so there are still
things I don't know!

I've got the disassembler to a point where it works OK on the instructions,
I haven't worked on the data side yet. I have put it aside for a bit, due
to increasing frustration levels and other things to do. If someone wants
a copy, e-mail me.

Thanks for all your responses, they were very useful.

Cheers,
