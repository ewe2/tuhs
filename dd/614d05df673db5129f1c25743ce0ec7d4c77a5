I remember attending a Unix International meeting where the mood was one 
of fear and despondency.  I thought their attitude insane but the few I 
spoke with thought that NT would take over the world.  (I encountered 
the same at a satnav meeting.  Motorola's satellites were in orbit -- I 
forgot the name of the actual venture -- and MS had just paired with 
somebody to put their own satellites up.  Fear everywhere.)
