 |Sure, but "stdin is a sequence of any type, and the argument is an \

 |that type has" is universal enough.
 |
 |The part that has to operate on a specific structure isn't the command, \
 |it's the arguments.
 |
 |For example, a powershell pipeline to produce a list of files sorted \

 |
 |gci . | sort lastwritetime | select name
 ...
 |*assuming that ls -t didn't exist*, to do this with unix tools that \

 |
 |ls -l | [somehow convert the date to a sortable format, probably in \
 |awk] | sort | [somehow pick the filename alone out of the output - \
 |possibly with cut or sed or awk again]
 |
 |and it's very difficult to get tools like awk, sort, and cut to work \
 |on formats that contain more than one field that may contain embedded \
 |spaces (you can just about get away with it for ls output because the \
 |date is always three "words").

Yes, that is really bad, except only that a lot of output is
pretty portables since a very long time.  FreeBSD started using
libxo in many base utilities, which can output in structured
formats.  This includes CSV and even CBOR :), i do not know how
the latter integrates in Unix text utilities however.  (I think
the format string syntax, that a bit originates in QT ??, could
have been warped to something better, like the Python ones, plus
further extensions, however.  But it is an improvement to what the
standard formats end up with when reordering etc. comes into
place.)
