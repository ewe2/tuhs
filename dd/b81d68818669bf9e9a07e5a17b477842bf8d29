SIMH lets you put the console on a telnet session so a single user can access
any OS that does console I/O over the network.  Not as good as TCP/IP in the
OS.

Harti's p11 PDP-11 emulator is the very best for running 2.11BSD with TCP/IP

When the CPU is running the idle loop p11 suspends so no wasted CPU.
