Same as the PDP-8, in fact.  But all my PDP-8 work was with OS/8,
which runs with interrupts off: you can turn them on in userland if your
program wants to use them, but you have to shut them off before invoking
any system services.  So I know little of these sixties sitcoms of
which you speak.

All exactly like the PDP-8.
