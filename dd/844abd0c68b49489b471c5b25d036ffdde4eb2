Just for fun I took the latest svn, assembled it with the v7 as
and ran it through my "a.out -> simh load file" converter.

It runs until it hits the first instruction which touches a KE11A EAE
register.  That fails and it panics (takes an exception since there's
nothing there on the unibus)

Via email I asked Tim about EAE support in simh, since apout has it and
the code claims he added it to simh, but I can't find it.

I could try e11, but I'd prefer to use simh.
