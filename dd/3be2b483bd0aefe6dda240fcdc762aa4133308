I think you are once again confused.  System Vr3 had something called the
file system switch which is what Berny is talking about.  SunOS had 
virtual file system layer (VFS) and that would be one of things ported
to SVr4.

The history on wikipedia matches my memory and contradicts much of what
you've been claiming.  For what it is worth, I didn't write a word of
that wikipedia page so others remember much as I do.
