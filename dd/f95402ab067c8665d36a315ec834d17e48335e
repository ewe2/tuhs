If you have been forced to connect to a "traditional UUCP" site, this may have 
been a useful concept.

With a packet size of 64 bytes and max. 3 windows, the protocol was OK for 2400 
baud, but not really usable for faster modems.

My enhanced packet handler supported dynamic packet sizes between 32 bytes and 
4096 bytes and 1..7 windows. 

Given that I could update the UUCP implementation of my news-feed in the 
university, this was a better solution than the Telebit protocol spoofing.

BTW: UUCP enhancements have been discussed by many people in comp.mail.uucp
Active people in that group have been e.g.

Ian Lance Taylor	various

Rick Adams		t protocol for TCP/IP

Matthias Urlichs	e protocol. similar to t protocol

Peter Honeyman		g protocol description
