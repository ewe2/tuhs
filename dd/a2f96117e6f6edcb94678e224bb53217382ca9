That's correct.  The feature was added to the 8th Research edition kernel,
but didn't migrate to the System III/V line until SVR4.  Shebangs began
very early in BSD as a csh-only hack, but appeared as a config option
in kernels as early as 2.8BSD, according to Wikipedia; 4.2BSD was the
first release that turned them on by default.

Perl has always (I think) had its own shebang support; you can get Perl
to exec an arbitrary interpreter for a script provided it has a shebang.
Modern shells will use /bin/sh to run scripts that *don't* have shebangs,
except for ksh which considers itself /bin/sh-compatible, and therefore
runs such scripts itself.
