Hello!
Brad, I am interested, although the space in my apartment would be the
big issue. The problem is that I am in an apartment in NYC, Queens to
be exact. Just how hard would it be to send it to me? If its both cost
and space excessive then perhaps others on the list would be
interested.

Oh and which model is this fellow? I am looking for a PDP-11/53, and
have been for many years.
