Thinking about a problem.    Think about simple, ugly CS problems and why
they are hard or ugly.  Your moral equiv of cleaning a few latrines.

I worked as an assembly programmer supporting TSS and York/APL when I first
broke in.
​  I had exactly the same experience.  Were as one of my friends did not.

I'll not name the person here because he's a good friend and many of you
know him.   But a one-time officemate of mine at start up and MIT grad​
were working on a system. And I was b*tching at him about something he had
written.   It was marvelous code, quite ingenious.   His comment was "Well
I only comment stuff I did not understand."


I look at him agast.   I said... "'Fred' you are on the smartest guys I
have ever known.  There is not much you don't understand.   Comment it for
us mortals please."

This was a lesson I was taught very early in my career (there are usually
spelling and grammar errors because of my dyslexia, but my comments are
usually parsable and understandable 40 years later - even by me).

forever indebted. My hope is that I am able to pay them by helping the next
generation a small amount, and trying to keep their ideas and spirits alive
in those new programmers.  I hope the new programmers do continue to write
new things and extend the art, but as I said recognise, they do their work
the shoulders of some wonderful and great people starting with tools and
ideas that hopeful they understand they learned from those masters.

Only time will tell. ​
