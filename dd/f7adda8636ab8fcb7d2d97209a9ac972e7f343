I thought it came from USG, as it was definitely in PWB 3.0 [which was
"rebranded" as System III post break-up], I think it may have been in PWB
2.0.   Mashey might remember.   I'll check any doc I have at home tonight,
but do not think I still have PWB 2.0 bits anywhere.  I think Warren has a
TAR image from Henry of the PWB 1.0 which to check.
