I've done this.  We wrote our own contract with the help a great lawyer
at Fenwick and West.  I showed him how one document was producing around
8 different licenses, from your basic nobody version all the way up to
Intel or HP or whoever master license agreements.  Once he saw how you
could do that, he said "this is so much better than maintaining 8 
different, but mostly the same, documents".  Exactly.

He editted the roff input directly.  I gave him a copy of BitKeeper 
and he used that to check in.  Comments were check in comments.
