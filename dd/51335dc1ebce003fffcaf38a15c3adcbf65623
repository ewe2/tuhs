Subject: [TUHS] cryptic cc error on v7
Message-ID: <8211c52a-5551-512d-d6ab-df601b86f560@gmail.com>

I found head on 3BSD and thought it might be as simple to compile as 
cr3, unfortunately, it isn't. I did:

$ cc head.c
head.o?

$ cc -c head.c
head.o?

$ pcc head.c
head.c
head.o?

I thought the assembler, as, was cryptic, at least there you get a one 
character error response. What is cc trying to say? Obviously head.o 
won't exist unless cc succeeds...

Thanks,

Will
