Yes we do.

The first two are about Rand ports. You=E2=80=99ve found the overview by =
Carl Sunshine, the implementation by Steve Zucker is the next report up =
on DTIC:
https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA044201.pdf

The TCP User guide report you refer to is about a TCP implementation =
done by Jack Haverty, which took an implementation in PDP-11 assembler =
and wrapped it in a NCP Unix shell. Jack has a listing in his attic, but =
it is not scanned.  The problem with this implementation was that it is =
was all very cramped in the kernel, so he had to reduce disk buffers =
substantially. As pipes (and Rand ports) use disk buffers to hold pipe =
data, which get swapped out to disk as needed, he found that his system =
trashed a lot and effective TCP speeds in his first trials were barely =
above few dozen byte per second.

The report is actually on the TUHS tree:
https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3DBBN-V6/doc
(there is also nroff source for Steven Zucker=E2=80=99s report, and =
other interesting material in that directory - such as a report on pipe =
performance).

The actual V6 implementation that is on that THUS page is not Jack =
Haverty=E2=80=99s version, but a version done from scratch by Mike =
Wingfield, using the learning=E2=80=99s of Jack=E2=80=99s work. Mike=E2=80=
=99s implementation worked quite well and won first prize in a March =
1979 tongue-in-cheek TCP4 conformance & interop competition. The BBN =
report for that version is 4295. Craig Partridge was kind enough to dig =
it up from the BBN library - I can send you a copy if you like (it was =
cleared for public release).

Although the implementation was done for research purposes (mainly =
Autodin II security features and simulation), it seems to have had a =
long life as a stop-gap to keep aging PDP-11=E2=80=99s connected after =
the switch from NCP to TCP in 1983.
