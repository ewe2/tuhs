My understanding is that the 3/50 is indeed some sort of VME system, as
is the 4/110, with some address related oddities.  But it has been a
very long time since I booted a 3/50 up...  The 3/50 I have are in their
cases, I just opened them up for the pictures.

What is not a VME system was the 3/80, which I also have.
