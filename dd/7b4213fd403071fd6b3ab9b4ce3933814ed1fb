Hi,

I have noticed, that 2.11BSD is in all cases where I looked set
to "fast boot", which AFAIK means no fsck of at least /. I found
nobody talking about this or providing information about how to
change it to "slow boot" with a proper check, which is now normal.

Is there a reason why it is not possible to deactivate fast boot?
Or is it just that nobody bothered to do it?

Thanks
Matthias
