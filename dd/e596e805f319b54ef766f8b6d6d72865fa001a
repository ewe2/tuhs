Oh I think we know from first-hand accounts that there were _people_
there who cared. When I wrote "they" earlier I was referring to the
corporation (since those are people now, you know!) which clearly
didn't; or at least made a decision that indicated that they thought
the cost was worth it.

I wouldn't kick AT&T's $100 million out of the house for running System V.

That it was, at least initially. It's actually pretty good now, but it
took a _long_ time to get there, and the forced incompatibilities
caused a lot of pain in the process, which was my original thesis.
Even now, though, I find some things gratuitously different than other
versions of Unix (network administration, for example). Managing NFS
is still something of a mystery to me.

Are there _distros_ that don't supply those things? Probably; I really
have no idea. Are there mainstream distros that do not? I doubt it.
However, they have to be installed, which is an additional step that
has to at least be accounted for. At scale, that's a pain: I imagine
that if, say, Google wanted to move to `ip` in lieu of `ifconfig` et
al in prod, it would be a multiyear process, including sunsetting the
older tools. Just identifying every use of `ifconfig` in a shell
script somewhere would be a pretty major undertaking.

By virtue of the existence of that additional step, however, there is
an incompatibility with the "older" way of doing things. By no longer
being the default, it is (in perhaps a minor way) a breaking change.

Surely the programmatic interfaces are separate from their realization
in a tool? I can understand the rigidity of some `ioctl` based
interface that's a pain to work around; I find it harder to believe
that plugging some other interface into `ifconfig` in a relatively
graceful way is untractible. Surely, in the limit, one could extend
ifconfig with a new verb as the first positional argument that expands
to the argument set of `ip`: `ifconfig ip address ...` etc. Maybe that
was considered and rejected by the maintainers.

This is an aside, but I'd suggest taking the opposite approach: rip
AX.25 out. It has serious bugs (including, apparently, leaking kernel
memory into transmitted packets?!) that have gone unfixed for years.
My AX.25 machine panics on reboot if there are active netrom
connections, and netrom packet state isn't cleaned up properly. The
maintainers seem to be out to lunch and are unresponsive on
linux-hams.

Personally, I'd prefer to see a FUSE-like mechanism for implementing
things like AX.25 in user-space: that would make it much easier to fix
things like that. On plan9, I would implement AX.25 as a userspace
program that exported a small filesystem and bind-mount it onto /net.
On Unix, a similar thing could be done with Unix-domain sockets and
daemons muxing the radio, but it wouldn't integrate nicely with the
existing tools. That's a problem with doing everything in a tightly
coupled, monolithic way.

Well, you kind of have. It's a small thing to install another package,
sure, but still something that must be done if you want the old tools.
