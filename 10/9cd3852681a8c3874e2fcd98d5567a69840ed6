When we were working on supporting BitKeeper on Windows, MacOS, all the
various Unix versions, and Linux, we implemented all the needed libc
stuff on Windows (so we could pretend we were not running on Windows).
Everything except fork(), we made a spawnvp() interface.  That's the
one thing that made more sense than the Unix way.  I have called fork()
directly in decades.
