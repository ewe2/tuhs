Deborah, I'll also add my voice in to ask for you to stay on the list.
There were things said that could have been expressed better, but I
don't think that there was malicious intent. You bring a wealth of
knowledge and experience to the TUHS list, and the list would be
poorer in your absence.

Yours sincerely, Warren
