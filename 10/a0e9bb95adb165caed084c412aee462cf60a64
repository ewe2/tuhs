Was TROFF ever in assembler?

I'm pretty sure NROFF was, as of V6; the source is not in the V6 distro, and
the binary is stripped, but looking at the object code, it doesn't look like C
compiler output.

As of the PWB system that MIT had (or maybe it was TS - how can one tell the
difference, does anyone know?), NROFF and TROFF were generated from the same C
source (which I have, if anyone wants to look at it).


    > the compiler needed some rework and thus typesetter C was born.

I heard he needed features (e.g. longs and unsigned), but... looking at the
N/TROFF source, there are _no_ 'unsigned's, and only a handful of 'long'
variables! There also don't seem to be any bit fields, typedefs, etc.

There is _one_ initialized structure (array of structures, to be precise).
(Although there are a lot of places were an int is initialized with a
double-character constant!)

About the only features in "C Changes" that it uses are i) register types on
arguments, and the 'static' storage class.

So now I'm wondering about that meme...
