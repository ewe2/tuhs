Subject: [TUHS] Any unix for MicroPDP-11?
Message-ID: <3F74473B.21D8226@njit.edu>

Greetings all, and forgive me if this was answered prevously, but i
didnt see it when i grepped the archive..


Are there any *nix versions in the archive that will run on a MicroPDP11
model 630QZ-AX?  Currently it is running RSX-11 /w what looks like a
seagate MFM/RLL type HDD.  It has only dual floppy for removeable.  But
i might be able to get my hands on a TK50/70 and qbus adapter for it. 

Thanks.
-Matt
