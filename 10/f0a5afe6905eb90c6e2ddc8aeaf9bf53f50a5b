We must be talking about a different BDS C.

I remember BDS C for all the wrong reasons; I can only repeat a remark 
from Henry Spencer about another alleged C compiler: "To be called a C 
compiler, it ought to at least be able to compile C."  My Z-80 C compiler 
was Hi-Tech C, which was full ANSI.

My favourite test of any language is "can it process itself?".
