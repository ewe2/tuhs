That sounds like the Ritchie V7 compiler or the Typersetter C from featured although since it was for the PE target could, I suspect it have been based on Steve’s by then.   

Any idea where the backend came from?  Was it from BTL or was it a different code generator?   I didn’t think much of the PE work left research but I don’t know for sure.  IIRC Leffler and Shannon had something for a compiler backend at Case when they started their PE port, although they had to do some hacking as the model they had was different from any previous PE (they had to deal with a number of 7 bit and 24 bit issues). I believe one of the attractions to the PE was they model the Research folks had access was 32 bits and the PDP-11 was 16.   I’ll try to ask Sam with what they started.

K&R was written before V7 was released and matched the Typesetter C compiler for V6 more than the later compiler released in V7.  i.e. A slightly more mature version compiler was included in UNIX/TS which was what Bourne used as the V7 ‘project manager’ (Steve had a couple interesting stories about the later process).  By that point in time void had been added as formal type to the language.
