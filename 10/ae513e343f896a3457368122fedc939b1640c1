Hi,
I have a little problem installing 2.11BSD on my PDP11/83. I have a TK50
tape with the distribution and a TK50 drive from a uvaxII. The controller
board is a M7546 that comes from another vax. The original tape drive in
this PDP is an TK25 drive which I have disconnected. How should the
TK50controller be strapped? The TK25 answered at 17772520. Should the TK50
be there as well? (I haven't got a clue howthe QBus works... I know it's
some kind of cascading thing though so I guess it matters in what order
the boards are placed in the machine)

Thanks for any help!

	That is the correct address for the first TS controller in the system.

	Despite the name ("TK25") the TK25 is a TS device and not a TMSCP 
	device.

	No.  The TK50 should be at the first TMSCP address which is 172150.

	You do not have to (indeed, you can not) set the vector on the M7546
	because TMSCP devices are 'programmable' - the kernel will assign
	a unique vector to the controller at boot time.

Hello -

	I looked at the wrong line in the dtab file earlier.  

	The primary TMSCP address (where the TQK50 adaptor should go) is
	174500.  I accidentally gave the address of the first MSCP ('ra')
	earlier.

	So if you have both a TK50 and a TK25 the boards should be set like
	this

		TK25	172520
		TK50	174500

	Sorry for any confusion I caused.

	Steven
