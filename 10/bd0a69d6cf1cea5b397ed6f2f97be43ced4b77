But there's nothing like the rush of warmed, slighly phenolic air from
the cooling fans of an old minicomputer - I've noticed the furnace
doesn't kick on when the 11/34 is running. (Of course, when I flip on
the RM02s, the breaker trips....)

Actually, I like playing with emulators - they use a LOT less power than

real computers :)

HP-UX comes with a REAL K&R c compiler that wont handle ANY ANSI stuff.

It's used to rebuild the kernel, but you can use it to build K&R C 
programs too.  That should be usable for the kernel C routines and 
utilities.  But as you pointed out, the assembly stuff you have to be 
rewritten.  Also, you'd have to deal with disk and tty drivers.
