Wikipedia simply cannot be trusted (as if it ever could).

You will get some imbecile who thinks that they "own" that topic, and when 
you challenge said moron because you happen to have personal information 
i.e. you were *there* at the time then the coward will simply block you.

Wikipedia is only as accurate as the last idiot who updated it.
