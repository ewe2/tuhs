Nice work. Looking forward to patch #250. And to respond to Noels remark 
about this being around for a long time without reports - since this is 
in FPSIM, and I believe the notes for 2.11BSD even says that this is an 
untested piece of code, which are not even know if it works or not, it's 
not something that have been used for ages. I'm in a way surprised it 
even worked at all. I think I've seen somewhere that it was last tested 
around 2.9BSD, and have not been officially tested since.

Well, had I had FPP simulated, I would maybe not have gotten a kernel 
panic anyway. It would all depend on where the address ended up. With my 
current build, the kernel would have been able to read the address, 
since it pointed into the boot diagnostics rom. So it's a dicey error at 
best.

But the tcsh error was very good that you also figured out. And I guess 
it means we now have a known working FPSIM. :-)
