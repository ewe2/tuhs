I've been mulling over something like this for some time.  I haven't
actually gotten very far because:
1) I hadn't found an open-source, 16-bit x86 C compiler that could run
   in 64K+64K.  It looks like there may be some suitable candidates now.
2) My planned target system succumbed to old age.  (The HDD failed and
   the bios only provides a choice of specific 80 or 120MB sizes).
