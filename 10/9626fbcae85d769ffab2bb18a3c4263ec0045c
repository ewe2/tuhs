> Has anyone roughly calculated =E2=80=9Cman years=E2=80=9D spent =

I cannot find the message at the moment (TUHS mail archive search is not =
working anymore?), but I recall that Doug McIlroy mentioned on this list =
that 1973 was a miracle year, where Ken & Dennis wrote and debugged over =
100,000 lines of code between them. In software, =E2=80=9Cman year=E2=80=9D=
 is an elastic yardstick...

There is also this anecdote by Andy Herzfeld:

=3D=3D=3D
Quickdraw, the amazing graphics package written entirely by Bill =
Atkinson, was at the heart of both Lisa and Macintosh. "How many =
man-years did it take to write QuickDraw?", the Byte magazine reporter =
asked Steve [Jobs].

Steve turned to look at Bill. "Bill, how long did you spend writing =
Quickdraw?"

"Well, I worked on it on and off for four years", Bill replied.

Steve paused for a beat and then turned back to the Byte reporter. =
"Twenty-four man-years. We invested twenty-four man-years in QuickDraw."

Obviously, Steve figured that one Atkinson year equaled six man years, =
which may have been a modest estimate.
=3D=3D=3D

There is also another anecdote involving Atkinson. At some point all =
Apple programmers had to file a weekly report with how many lines of =
code they wrote that week. After a productive week of refactoring and =
optimising, he filed a report saying =E2=80=9Cminus 2,000 lines=E2=80=9D.
