Subject: [TUHS] Sys III - Yet Again
Message-ID: <200401262246.20993.wes.parish@paradise.net.nz>

I just thought of a reason _why_ Caldera was unable to clarify the status of 
System III - if you look at the documents on Groklaw.net, 
http://www.groklaw.net/staticpages/index.php?page=legal-docs

one of them's a document between Novell and SCO Original, where the System V 
releases are enumerated.  Another is a similar document which mentions the 
Ancient Unix and their manuals as being part of the deal.

Neither document that I can recall, mentions anything about System III - and 
apparently Warren Toomey had to supply them with that, so it would appear 
that System III is - quite literally - unclaimed by anyone, apart from its 
copyright notices, and thus - since neither The SCO Group nor Novell has laid 
claim to it in their copyright battle - it could well be considered Public 
Domain.

Just a thought, and don't take my word for it.
