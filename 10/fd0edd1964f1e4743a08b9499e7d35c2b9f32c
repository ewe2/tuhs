When I run engineering teams the point I make is if you wrote the code
more than 6 months ago it might as well be someone else's code.  So
write it in a way that someone else can debug / extend it.

I also made the point that "clever" sucks.  At least most of the time.
All "clever" means is "hard to understand".  The brief joy one gets 
from clever code is stomped on by the frustration one gets from having
to fix it.  

When they wouldn't listen to that I'd say "I'm the dumbest guy here, right?
And I'm the boss.  And I debug could.  The path to a big bonus does not 
go through clever code".  That seemed to work.

Personally, I find code that is clean, straightforward, obvious to be
beautiful.  The clever stuff usually strikes an odd note, not a good
one.
