Yes, they look clean but different to each other.

I'm guessing that the reason might be that it is easier to exercise=20
*roff's capabilities than it is to push LaTeX to get good results=20
without spending a huge amount of time.

I wonder if Prentice-Hall and O'Reilly & Associates might be willing to=20

Don't they ever?!  It has gotten to the point that Computer Modern=20
actually makes me feel *fatigued* when I encounter it when reading, say,=20
a mathematics monograph.

On the other hand it's the perfect typeface for r=C3=A9sum=C3=A9s and CV'=
s for=20
computer scientists.  Like a secret handshake.

Perhaps the reason that the CM typeface is so common is that changing=20
typefaces in LaTeX is complicated and difficult so authors leave it=20
alone.  At least this has been my experience.

This is fascinating insider information, and it leads me full circle to=20
several reasons why I want to try to use *roff in the first place:

1.  Do you think there is any chance of obtaining these macro packages?=20
Either from authors who haven't passed away, or from the publishing=20
houses themselves?

2.  I get the impression that writing a macro package or editing an=20
existing is relatively straightforward.  Would you agree?

     Or, at least, that it makes some kind of sense.  I could never make=20
head or tail of LaTeX's macro extensions.  I certainly didn't want to=20
spend my life trying to figure it out.

     I still remember the sinking feeling in my stomach when I realized=20
that the five (or so) books that make up the de facto canon of LaTeX=20
user documentation (published by Addison-Wesley) are thousands of pages=20
in total.  I did not want to engage with that.

I have no particular intention to speak ill of LaTeX.  Rather, it is my=20
only point of reference for publishing-grade typesetting and=20
unfortunately I don't have fond memories of it.

Kind regards,

Andrew
