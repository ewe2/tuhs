Hello (again) from Gregg C Levine
I take it this means that the software written for those things, won't
run on an emulator normally running as a member of the regular PDP
family of machines? Such as the SIMH PDP-11 emulator, or the E11 ones.
Mr. Wilson, (John), mentions the operating system for the PRO, on the
PDF file that describes the E11, both versions as being copyrighted,
and mentions the company name.
