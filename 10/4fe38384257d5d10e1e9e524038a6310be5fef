Subject: [TUHS] Etymology of the open file table?
Message-ID: <CAEoi9W6m-va2u0ZCRdSMrvSS-ELq8GFSWg=QUyWBOsVakqeMFA@mail.gmail.com>

This came up today at work; what's the origin of the open file table? The
suggestion was made that, instead, a ref-counted data structure could be
allocated at open() time to serve the same purpose, and that a table of
open files was superfluous. My guess was that this made it (relatively)
easy to look up what files referred to a particular device?
