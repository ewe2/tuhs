> Yep.  Im pretty sure I remember void being in typesetter C also.   =
IIRC the differences between that version of Dennis=E2=80=99s compiler =
and what was included in 7th Edition was mostly in the libraries ie =
stdio was first released as part of the typesetter compiler but it was =
still a work in progress.  =20

My biggest recollection was the beginning of flipping =3D+ to +=3D (It =
supported both but warned you about the former), and fixing the =
structure elements to not be global.

Lots of odd quirks in the kernel due to early C limitations.    =
PS->integ always has a fond part of my memory.
