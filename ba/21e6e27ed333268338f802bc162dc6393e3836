OK, serious question. Why did Sun "sell out" to AT&T if they could
have raised capital in the market?  Did the executive team just not
care about what moving to System V would mean? Or did they not understand
it?

How desperate were they? And why were they so desparate? Were there
other alternatives they could have pursued?

I too lived through those times, from the outside, and it was indeed
a shocker when they moved from SunOS to Solaris.

Thanks,

Arnold
