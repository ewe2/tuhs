The OSF/DCE's RPC system came from Apollo, as does the predecessor for
the UUID layout still in use today (RFC 4122).  Paul Leach brought
both to the OSF, and as the Kerberos V5 Tech Lead, I worked with Paul,
and used an early Internet-Draft spec of the OSF UUID and implemented
it in e2fsprogs for labelling ext2/3/4 superblocks, and from there the
infection vector spread to the GNOME project.  When Paul brought both
of those technologies to Microsoft when he went there after OSF went
belly up.
