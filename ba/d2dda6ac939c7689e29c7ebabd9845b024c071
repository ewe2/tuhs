 |This is because in git the "id" of a changeset is its sha1

Linus Torvalds wrote an interesting message on that many years
ago, which someone pointed me at ditto.  Do not ask.  git cannot
generate human readable things by design, with branching and
merging, and due to the distributed nature.  I have a little (git
pre-commit) script which keeps my SCCS IDs alive for my web pages,
even after i converted them to git.  But i think for code bases
like NetBSD in particular this is a total show stopper (they
really keep the "original" file preamble alive, do they?), but it
also is for OpenBSD i think, and for FreeBSD i know that having
a human readible sequentially increasing version number was a main
reason to go for subversion.  Even though there seems to be
a growing number of people who want to switch to git, yes i think
Warner Losh just said something like "when we will have switched
to git, that will xy", this week?
