As long as you don't reuse tainted Unix source code in your job, you will
be ok. There are so many books covering the Unix kernel: Lions, Bach,
Goodheart, Vahalia etc., that any concerns other than source code reuse
are negligible.

That's my feelings, anyway.

I think this relates to a spectre raised during the USL/BSDI wars.
Somebody suggested that anybody who had been exposed to AT&T source
code was ``tainted'' and could thus not legally develop competitive
systems.  Somewhere I have a button that somebody brought back to me
from a USENIX, with the text ``mentally contaminated''.

Jesper, I don't think you need to worry about the problem.  That kind
of restriction would be unenforceable.
