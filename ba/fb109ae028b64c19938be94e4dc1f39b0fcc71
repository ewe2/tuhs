Does anyone have documentation or history for European efforts in the =
Unix-like operating systems? For example there was Bull=E2=80=99s Chorus =
which I seem to recall was based on Mach or a competing microkernel (it =
was a very long time ago and I used it for no mare than about two =
hours..).

I am rather saddened by the fact that there is so much about all the =
Unix (and not only Unix) history of computing in the USA and so very =
little in Europe. I wouldn=E2=80=99t even know where to start, to be =
honest, all I have as a history is the Italian side from my father and =
his other mad friends and colleagues in Milan. So little of it is =
recorded, never mind written down.
