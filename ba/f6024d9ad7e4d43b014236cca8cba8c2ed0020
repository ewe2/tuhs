This really is more a C question than a UNIX one.    The problem is that
the preprocessor macros are really kind of a kludge.   Making things
either enums (or in later C/C++ const int definitions) is a lot cleaner. =

 The #define is just probably backwards a compatibility kludge (for peopl=
e
using things like MS_RDONLY or whatever in other macros).
