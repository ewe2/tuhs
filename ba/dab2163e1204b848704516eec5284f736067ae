And the one editor that every sysadmin should know.  I still use "expr" in 
my shell scripts, for example, because I don't know how portable the

Looking through /usr/include/***.h, I see:

FreeBSD 10.4:	#define SYS_MAXSYSCALL  548
MacOS Sierra:	#define SYS_MAXSYSCALL  522
Debian 8.10:	I don't know where the Penguins have hidden it...

That's the second endorsement I've seen for Go; I guess I should learn it.

And yes, I've read the amusing story on Wikipedia :-)  I'm becoming 
annoyed at Perl's bloatedness (I'd hate to see Perl 6), don't like 
Python's silly indentation (although some swear by it), and looking at 
Ruby for stuff where I used to use Perl.
