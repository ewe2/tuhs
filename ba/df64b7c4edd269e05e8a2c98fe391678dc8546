OK, good, I see you've labeled your system disk.

OK, trap 6 code 2 is integer divide by zero on the VAX. My obvious guess is
that the disk has a garbage label on it and when the kernel tries to interpret
it, it divides by zero and blows up. A garbage label is something worse than no
label at all, because the label structure has a magic at the beginning, and
trust me, the kernel does check it and it does not blow up with a divide by
zero when block 0 is all zeros.

Wilko, what exactly do you have in the label block of disk 1? If you've been
following my installation instructions to the letter, that disk would be your
Ultrix disk. My installation instructions call for labeling the BSD disk, but
not the Ultrix disk. In fact, putting a BSD label on an Ultrix bootable disk
would render it unbootable, as Ultrix has boot code where BSD has the label.
This means that normally when someone follows my Ultrix-based installation
procedure, BSD will simply view the Ultrix disk as unlabeled and make it one
big partition a. You obviously have something else in there.

Well, this at least means that this is not yet another one of my own bugs, so
that's the good news. :-) But sure, the kernel could do with a few more label
sanity checks so that it prints a nice error message instead of blowing up.
I'll look into it.

All,
	Dennis Ritchie just emailed me with a URL about Dan Bricklin's
efforts to release his original VisiCalc:

	http://www.bricklin.com/history/vcpostingreactions.htm

The URL contains a link to an email from Dennis about his attempts to
get the older UNIX source code, and the primeval C compilers, released:

	http://www.bricklin.com/history/dmrletter.htm

Cheers,
	Warren

Hi all,
	I also asked Dennis if we could put his two old `primeval' C
compilers into the archive. He said:

	I don't have a problem with copying the compilers, more or
	less as a mirror.   I wonder if anyone will try to revive them?

I've had a go at reviving them today, using V5 cc and tools. It's a
real PITA I can assure you. I've got the last1120c compiler compiled,
but I can't get it to compile itself. As soon as it sees line 16 in c00.c

	 i = namsiz;

it complains that the LHS isn't an Lvalue.

I think I'll stop now, my brain is hurting too much :-)

Ciao,
	Warren

So are they now on minnie or not? If they are, then where? I just looked and
couldn't find them.
