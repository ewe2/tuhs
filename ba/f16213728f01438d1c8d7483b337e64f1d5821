djggp relies on a DOS extender to run its 32-bit programs in a 16-bit 
operating environment on a 32-bit machine.  go32 is Delorie's own DOS extender 
- OpenWatcom offers at least two other DOS extenders to pull the same kind of 
trick. 
 
If the purpose is to run a 32-bit Unix C compiler in a 16-bit Unix operating 
environment on a 16-bit machine, it just won't work.  I've never heard of 
anyone ever running djgpp on a 286, either.
