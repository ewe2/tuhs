But BSD basically stagnated during the suit - which took 2-3 years.
No-one wanted to have anything to do with BSD whilst the suit was
on and it took a while to recover.  Linux was unaffected and basically
gained 3-4 years headstart.

What Greg is suggesting is that if something equivalent comes along
for Linux (and I don't believe the SCO case is it), it will put a
really serious dent in its growth.  Even if Linux won, the after-effect
will last for years.
