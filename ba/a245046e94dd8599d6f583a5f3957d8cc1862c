Not according to this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-3

The 3/50 was indeed a "pizza box" according to this, but Brad Spencer's 
images 7A and 7B he purports these are 3/50 boards: 
http://anduin.eldar.org/~brad/sunstuff/ - and those are definitely VME 
form-factor. Although, it's possible it uses only that "custom/private" 
third connector on the VME backplane?
