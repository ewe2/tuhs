I have a spare copy of the '72 /45 handbook; send me your address, and I'll
send it along. (Every PDP-11 fan should have a copy of every edition of every
model's handbooks... :-)

In the meantime, I'm too lazy to scan the whole thing, but here's the first
page of Chapter 6 from the '72:

There are a few remnant relics of the 'segment' phase, e.g. here:

  http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V6/usr/sys/conf/m45.s

which has this comment:

  / turn on segmentation

Also, if you look at the end, you'll see SSR0, SSR1 etc (as per the '72
handbook), instead of the later SR0, SR1, etc.
