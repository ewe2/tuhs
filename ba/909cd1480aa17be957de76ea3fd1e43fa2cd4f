A small addition..  there was a 4.1.4, a.k.a. Solaris 1.1.2 [I think]
that made it out the door [Google around for references].  I remember
having the cd and installing it.  I also remember 4.1.3_U1, but not U2
or U3, but I wouldn't be suprised that they existed.  I was at AT&T at
the time and the group I was in resisted going to Solaris 2.x for as
long as we could.  We were mostly interested in desktop and small server
stuff, so SMP need not apply and Solaris 2.x where x <= 4 was painful.
I remember the Sparc 5 Model 170 with SunOS 4.x which ran, for us, just
as well as the Ultra 1.  Fun times....
