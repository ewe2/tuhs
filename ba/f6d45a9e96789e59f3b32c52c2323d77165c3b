I have a few. Given we have some 2nd Edition 0407 binaries, and also the first C
compiler source code http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Applications/Early_C_Compilers/
can recompile itself down to a 2nd Edition binary, and we have some C code
fragments for 2nd Edition, I would like to see the 1st Edition kernel modified
just enough to be able to run the 0407 binaries.

That would make most of the "early stuff" executable again.

P.S Using the rf0.dsk image to get my homegrown mkfs working. More later.
