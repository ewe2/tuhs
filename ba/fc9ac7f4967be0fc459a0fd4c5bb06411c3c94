As a user of these systems, the offical 7th Edition kernel most certainly
could not execute a script, only binaries. It happend after the release
1979 and took time to make its way out, which it did via DSB before 8th Ed
was finalized in 1985.

The usenet announcement of this new functionality from Dennis is on
Jan 10, 1980. Is listed here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

Dennis stated the idea was not his, it came up during csonverastions at
a conference.
