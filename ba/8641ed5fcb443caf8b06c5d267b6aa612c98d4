Subject: [TUHS] Ancient UNIX now under a BSD license
Message-ID: <200201240025.g0O0Pb767927@minnie.tuhs.org>

All,
	Amazing news. I have been negotiating with Caldera to release the
Ancient UNIX under a BSD-style license. Well, they got it done faster
than I expected. See attached license.

I'll start removing the username/password stuff on the Unix Archive soon.

	Warren
