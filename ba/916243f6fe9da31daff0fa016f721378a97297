Subject: DEC documentation preservation [RE: VS3100m76 ethernet problem (fwd)]
Message-ID: <Pine.SGI.4.04.10003081539590.22863-100000@world.std.com>

I saw the following on the linux-vax list.  It seems to me it might be
worthwhile for us to get more info on the scope of the project, its terms,
and to see if we can collectively contribute to it.  We'd all benefit from
having better access to old DEC documentation.

The Dallas/Fort Worth DECUS local users group is scanning all Digital
documentation, no matter how old.  You might contact them
(denton at dsserv.com or wisniewski at dwlug.decus.org) to see if they'd like to
copy your manuals.

You get a free copy of everything they've scanned when they finish.
