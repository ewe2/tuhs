In the dark mists of time I did have libpcap going and a 2.11BSD
system networked, but I haven't gotten around to figuring out how to
make that happen again. For my current experiments networking is
overkill, I just want a simple way to copy a file between host and
target. Indeed a lot of simulators provide just such a program,
although I guess that's harder in SIMH because of its large scope.

The block device method might be better though. I was unfamiliar with
how disklabels and how geometry worked in BSD, so I wasn't too sure if
this would work. It would be great if someone could try it. In the
meantime my method is tested and known to work, for bidirectional
transfer. I'm at my PC now so I'm attaching both the blocking script
(file2mt.py) and the deblocking script (mt2file.py). I have some simh
scripts for bringing up a 4.3BSD system but unfortunately they use
mkdisttap.pl (similar to file2mt.py) so I don't have a working example
of file2mt.py that I can just paste in, but I am happy to provide more
specific instructions if what I've posted already hasn't been enough.

cheers, Nick
