Don Knuth talks at length about how TeX & MetaFont came about etc. in =
his Web of Stories interview in parts 50 through 70. In Part 56 he does =
say he looked at "the system developed at Bell Labs", presumably troff. =
In part 68 he talks about the importance of stability fot TeX and later =
talks about LaTeX and ConTeXt.

I must say I am a fan of TeX/LaTeX and not a fan of nroff/troff -- I =
don't like the troff look and I don't like the markup. The nice thing is =
we can choose whatever typesetting tools we want! I played with other =
alternatives such as lout and Sile but didn't like them all that much. I =
immediately liked the TeX's model of boxes and glue. I like the fact =
that I can typeset Indic language text beautifully. But like any complex =
tool, you have to take time to learn it and practice to get proficient =
at it.

At the same time I am not a fan of the way Knuth does literate =
programming. What I'd like is a two view editor where I can jump from =
code to related documentation and vice versa. And when you're working on =
one, the related part in the other view highlighted. In this world I =
don't want to deal with files and directories -- just one virtual =
document, however it is stored put under version control!
