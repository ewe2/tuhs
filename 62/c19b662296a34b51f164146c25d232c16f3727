As was suggested on the list, I=E2=80=99ve reached out to Peter =
Weinberger to better understand the time line of the File System Switch =
and the 8th edition network file system. He has been very helpful, but =
the one line summary is that it is unfortunately too long ago to =
remember specific details with any certainty. In general Peter remembers =
that he was concerned that the project was too big for one person to do, =
and hence always looked for design choices that would leave the work =
scope manageable.

Time line.

Since my last post on this subject I have found that the ACM conference =
talk of March 1985 was also held 9 months earlier at a Usenix conference =
- leaving a time slot between end of 1981 and summer 1984. Peter vaguely =
remembers that the essential ideas were done "before 1983=E2=80=9D. It =
would stand to reason that 1983 was spent on getting corner cases of the =
network file system right, but all this is no more than plausible =
conjecture.

File system switch (FSS).

The guiding thought for the FSS was to extend the philosophy of =
=E2=80=98everything is a file=E2=80=99 to new areas, also other than =
network files. Early implementations already included a simple, =
read-only =E2=80=98/proc=E2=80=99 file system for example. I asked if =
any experiments had been done with virtualising =E2=80=98/dev', but =
Peter could not recall any such work.

I personally find that the FSS has an elegance that fits with other =
parts of Research Unix and asked Peter about its origins. He does not =
recall any special "a-ha=E2=80=9D moments, but does recall that the way =
it was done just felt natural to him. Other options would have included =
to do the switch at the sys call level (which felt too complicated) or =
at the block device level (which felt too limited).

I also asked about how his reworking of =E2=80=99namei=E2=80=99 and =
centralising all namespace operations in that function came about (in my =
view it is key to a concise switch). Here, too, it is too long ago to =
remember any specifics, but Peter comments that he never liked to write =
much code and that spending time on finding ways to make the amount of =
coding as small and straightforward as possible would have been in =
character.

Eighth edition network file system

Once the FSS exists, a simplistic network file system is not hard - just =
do RPC to a remote server. Peter chose to do a user level file server in =
order to keep the work scope and complexity down to manageable levels. =
As highlighted in the ACM paper, the devil is in the detail of =
replicating all the semantics of normal local disk files. Cases like a =
file being kept alive if a process still has it open, the complexities =
of cross-mounted network files (let alone recursively mounted), handling =
failed connections, etc. were hard to sort out and get right.
