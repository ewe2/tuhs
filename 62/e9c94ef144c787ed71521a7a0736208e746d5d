That is not a cp error: it is the kernel reporting that the limited
amount of space in userland reserved for command arguments on an exec()
has been exceeded.  It can still happen in modern systems if directories
are exceedingly large.

"Phase error" means that a file has been modified while "ar" is working
on it.  The most common reason (which doesn't seem to be relevant in
this case) is that "ar" is trying to archive the archive.

> ar u all.a /usr/source/s1/b*

If that worked, then "cp /usr/source/s1/b* ." would work too.
