The controller is an RK11.
The disk drives are RK02, RK03, RK05.

The RK02 is a 1.2MB drive (256B per sector).
The RK03 is a 2.4MB drive (512B per sector).
The RK05 is a 2.4MB drive (512B per sector).

The media for the RK03 and RK05 are compatible (IBM 2315).  The drives
look different from each other, but I don't think the system can tell
the difference.
