I dunno.  I can't look at that and know what it means.  So it means I have
to toss (by the time this came out) a decade or more worth of knowing how
to use sockets and learn this new model that may or may not go anywhere.

That would have made a huge difference.  The problem with Unix is it
is largely good enough.  All sorts of warts appeared over the years
but you can get your job done.  Plan 9 was such a big departure that
it never gained traction.  Having it conform to Posix or pick the
most popular Unix (SunOS?  BSD?) and conform to that.  I'm biased but
even if I wasn't I'd have picked SunOS, virtually all open source back
in the day compiled out of the tarball on SunOS.  Everyone else had 
to tinker or run configure or whatever.
