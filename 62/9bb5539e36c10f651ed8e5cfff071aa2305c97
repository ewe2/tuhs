If you like ZFS you don't understand operating systems design.  I do.
Jeff Bonwick was a stats student at Stanford when he took my OS class,
I convinced him to come to Sun.  Bill Moore worked for me.  That's the two
main ZFS guys and I thought I had taught them well but they let me down.

ZFS doesn't use the page cache, they said it was too hard because ZFS
is compressed.  A typical file system just has block numbers, a compressed
one needs another int per block, it's the int that says these many bytes
are a block uncompressed.  It's not that hard, it is 2 ints instead of 1.

In case I'm not being clear, the page cache is what everyone else uses
but ZFS has its own cache.  So if you want to mmap() a ZFS file, ZFS
has to bcopy() the data into the page cache and then spend a shit ton
of code to make sure that the page cache data is in sync with the ZFS
cache data.

SunOS came from BSD but SunOS added mmap.  Which had the same problem,
the BSD buffer cache was exactly the same as the ZFS cache, Sun spent 
years of effort to get rid of the buffer cache, everything is in the 
page cache.  So ZFS was a HUGE step backwards in systems design.  Might
be the best file system ever (it is not) but it was not a good player
in the OS world.

Those guys said that it was too hard to make a compressed file fit in
the page cache.  BitKeeper has that code and proves that it can be done.
Be happy to walk anyone who cares through that code, I didn't write that,
Wayne Scott did, but it's some of the best written code I've ever seen.
Up there with Mojo's work on the SunOS VM system.  (I'll bet that noone
takes me up on this offer, people love to argue but most don't want to
learn.  Prove me wrong, please).

So good on you that you like ZFS and FreeBSD.  I don't and I don't for
really good reasons.

Let's try it this way.  Get back to me when you can show me 40 people 
who have installed FreeBSD on their own, with no help.  In the same 
time, I can show you 40,000 people who have installed Linux on their
own, with no help.  Probably 400,000.

Technology is great, ease of use is what gets you users.  ZFS is
great but doesn't play nice with the OS.

That's my oh brother.

Now that Linux has ZFS, it doesn???t seem as stuck in the dark ages, but uptime on my fbsd instance is 10x any of my Linux instances. We are soooo off topic, I think :). But, I???m always up for talking up FBSD. I use it in my classes, too and the system is much more coherent for my systems programming classes than linux.
