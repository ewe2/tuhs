And that's exactly what's wrong with C now -- except it's probably even
a bit worse for C as the majority of people who have been sitting on the
C standards committees for the past decades are primarily either those
with deeply funded agendas about how they think they can make more money
with the language if only it behaves a certain way (e.g. more like C++);
and/or a few academic compiler and optimizer experts who have strong
ideas about how they can eek the tiniest gains from their compilers if
only the spec says certain things.  UB (undefined behaviour), for
example, should be stricken from the standard completely and forever.
Every behaviour MUST be defined, either by the implementation (with NO
recourse for or fallback to UB), or, strictly defined, by the standard.
