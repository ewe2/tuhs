Subject: [TUHS] Caldera ancient UNIX license question
Message-ID: <CAPUPbvR4iaAdZnPgY8HEaqX-HSks-PAOScbY6HefCN-FJNspzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all!

Since by the jury of 2010 we now know that Novell, not SCO, owns the UNIX
copyright, is the Caldera ancient UNIX 4-clause BSD-license still valid?

Thanks in advance, God bless!

- Stefan.
