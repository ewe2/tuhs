Hmm, does the PDP-11 item make this on topic for TUHS? :-)

There is actually a lot of PDP-11 software in ITS, because 11s were used
all over the place as dedicated processors to control hardware devices.
There's a cross assembler called PALX, and several debuggers called RUG
and CARPET.

No Unix though.
