Subject: [TUHS] OT: USENET article involving DEC machines and atomic tests
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.11.1611181148020.19595@aneurin.horsfall.org>

Hoping someone can help me here, as I've grepped the 'net to no avail.

Back when USENET was supreme and dinosaurs strode the earth, there was a 
hilarious article involving a DEC box (long forgotten it) that was used to 
instrument underground atomic tests.  In one scene, the box was atop a 
truck which was right over the hole; they both went skywards, but the data 
was recovered by taking out the core memory boards and plugging them into 
another box.

Does anyone remember it?  It does sound rather suss...
