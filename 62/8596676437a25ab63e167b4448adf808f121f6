That is an interesting comment. DMR was on the steering committee for =
what would become 4.2BSD.

I once spoke with Kirk McKusick about the origins of the sockets API and =
I think he told me that there was a lot of debate in the committee =
whether descriptor readiness API should be stateful (like Haverty=E2=80=99=
s await() https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3DBBN-V6/ken/awaitr.c=
 ) or stateless (like select). According to Sam Leffler (who I think =
added select() to 4.1c BSD) the select system call was somewhat modelled =
after the ADA select statement.=20

I am speculating now, but I would not be surprised if dmr favoured the =
stateless design and contributed to its design.
