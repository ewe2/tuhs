Perl was nice in its early years as it was much more capable than awk.
I understood its original intent to be a better glue language.  While
I find the syntax to be ugly, that's not where I hit a Wall.  To me,
the thing that makes Perl a bad language is the magic side effects left
in things like _0 from many operations.  This is stuff that one is not
likely to remember unless it's used every day.  I think that it's why
so many consider Perl to be write-only; too many magic implicit things
instead of being explicit.  I understand that compactness was a big
deal 40 years ago but no longer.
