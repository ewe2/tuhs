There is. :)

IIRC, you want something along the lines of:

ld -i -o irc -Z a.o b.o -Z c.o d.o -Z e.o f.o -Y g.o h.o -lc

where -i says to use split I/D (64KB for each), each -Z introduces a set
of object modules to go into one overlay, and the -Y introduces the
object modules that are not to be overlaid.  You'll want your main() to
be in the -Y group, ideally along with the most used parts of the code.
Each -Z group should ideally contain object modules that are all used at
the same time; the idea is to minimize the number of overlay swaps that
have to be done.

There are binaries in 2.11BSD that are built in this way.  Look for the
-Z flag in the Makefiles.

Use size(1) on the a.out to see the sizes of the various overlays and
the main area: you'll get error messages from ld(1), and size(1) will
help you figure out how you need to move objects around to keep the main
area under 56KB, and each overlay under 8KB.  (Actually, I seem to
recall that those limits can also be 48 and 16, or 40 and 24, and so
on.  'man ld' might be of help.)

You might be able to squeeze it in.  Your data space usage will be less
on a 16-bit system, and you may be able to reduce the sizes of arrays
and allocations here and there by accepting limitations in the resulting
program.
