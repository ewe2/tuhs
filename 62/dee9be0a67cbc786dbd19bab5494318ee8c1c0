Speaking as an ex-Xerox/Alto guy, there was some flow in the other direction as well.  Cedar started with a Tenex CMD JSYS derived command line, like the Alto OS before it, but having received the True Word from V7 at Stanford, I wrote a Cedar shell with standard I/O and redirection and shell scripts.  I don’t think I did pipes.  It did become the standard command line interface.  Then Warren Teitelman added DWIM to it which was highly entertaining at times.
