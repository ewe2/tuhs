Well, don't feel yourself put out by your relative youth. I discovered Unix about the time I (seriously) 
discovered computers in 1990. I'd read up what little info I could get on computers while I was at High 
School in Canberra  - they actually had (general theory) books on computers, but then, Canberra hosts 
an observatory and a couple of high-quality universities, so it stands to reason ...

I read (in Bits and Bytes, an NZ computer mag) about Minix and Coherent, and their multitasking and 
whatnot, and thought, now I've got started in computers, let's get serious.(I'd got started on Macintosh 
then tried my hand at MS DOS)

Unix is to computer geeks as Bach (or Coltrane) is to music geeks. Discussion and arguments aplenty, 
but nobody's denying the importance.

Welcome aboard.
