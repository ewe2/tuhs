Hey, everyone is welcome to their own opinion and it doesn't have to match
mine.  I review a lot of code, a lot of code that I didn't write.  Lots of
times the review is in a web browser that doesn't know how to tag to the
definition.  Sure I can clone the repo and make tags and tag to it but for
small reviews there is no need.

I do a bunch of code reviews every day.  foo.size is a lot less helpful
than foo.vfs_size or whatever.

Your mileage may vary, where I work we optimize for the reader not for
the writer.  That's how it is when you work for me.  When I work for 
you then your rules win :)
