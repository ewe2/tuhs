In the early 90ths I written some larger programs in Turbo Pascal after yea=
rs of intensively working with my favored C&C++ language, and was surprised=
 how well designed the Borland language was. Thus, recently I installed Fre=
e-Pascal with its comfortable IDE and since then I'm wondering why they alw=
ays inventing new languages as these 'old' C&Pascal languages are so well d=
esigned and implemented, that I can't imagine that anything else is really =
needed.
