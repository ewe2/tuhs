Check out VNC - you run a "server" on the remote side, and the VNC 
client on the client side. The advantage is that everything you run 
stays running on the remote side.

I use this setup all the time for a security-conscious Fortune 100 
company I consult for, as well as personally.

Now, of course, it can be argued that VNC has it's security problems, 
some of which stem from X11 itself. For example, I can't tell you how 
many people do an "xhost +" either manually or (to my horror) in 
.vnc/xstartup - But that's X11's problem not VNC.

Add "ssh -X" to all of this.
