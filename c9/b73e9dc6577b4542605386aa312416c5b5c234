According to "The Evolution of the Unix Timesharing System", full path names
arrived later than I/O redirection, so by they time they needed a separator,
'>' and '<' were gone. '/' also has the advantage of being a non-shift
character!

PS: Re-reading that, I see that early Unix did not have an exec() call (as I
was just discussing); it was done in user mode, with normal read and write
calls.
