Time to start a new thread :-)

Back when Unix was really Unix and dinosaurs strode the earth, login names 
were restricted to just 8 characters, so you had to be inventive when 
signing up lots of students every term (ObUS: semester).

A wonderful Japanese girl, Eriko Kinoshita, applied for an account on some 
box somewhere.  Did I mention that login names defaulted to the first 8 
characters of the surname?

Understandably annoyed, Plan B for assigning logins was applied, which was
the first name followed by the first letter of the surname.

Sigh...
