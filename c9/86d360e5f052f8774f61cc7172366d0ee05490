Ah -- if it was adb you redid, no doubt of its power.  I used adb for a
long time -- PDP-11/VAX/68K but as you said, you could learn a lot about
your system.   FWIW:  we embedded adb into RTU, calling it kdb.   We didn't
have no fancy VMs to run the system under, when it halted, it halted.   On
a personal machine that was not a problem and adb/kdb was very cool.
