Subject: [TUHS] Backport cut to V7
Message-ID: <CADxT5N4ggDbxvbeAfwS76p4KA1vZQM3yOoeZaSQBnnqU=jWSJA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm not sure how old cut is, but a quick look at the code gave me the
idea it could be backported to V7, as I'm fairly sure that cut wasn't
in V7.

It doesn't look like it needs a lot of stuff, just fclose, puts, do
and while loops. Even a  v6 or v5 backport doesn't seem too difficult.
