In short: the VT05 was DEC's first video terminal, from the early '70s, and
would have presumably been in use at some installations that used early
Unix.  My guess - and this is entirely a guess - is that it had been
entirely supplanted by the VT52 and friends by the time Unix gained
widespread popularity.

There is a pretty good overview of the VT05 at
https://vt100.net/dec/vt05.html and
http://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/DEC_VT05 has a plethora of
pictures.

I have no idea why there are no termcap/terminfo entries for the VT05.
stty in BSD as early as 2.79 understands "vt05" as a settings argument, but
it's not clear to me what you would use for $TERM.
