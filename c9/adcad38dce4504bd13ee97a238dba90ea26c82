Dr. John Lions?  He was one of my Comp.Sci lecturers, and a brilliant 
bloke.

It was a sad day when we lost him.

I remember a USENET posting from long ago (yeah, I know), when someone 
swore that it was Lyons.  Someone then replied along the lines of "Well, 
I've just walked past his office door; it's Lions, as in the big cat."

Of course, my memory could be a little flakey by now.
