Yeah, you are both right, I was fooled by not seeing telnetd in the ps
output. Turns out telnetd is invoked throught the inetd daemon.

	$ grep telnet /etc/inetd.conf
	# Ftp and telnet are standard Internet services.
	telnet  stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/in.telnetd in.telnetd

And by the way, the two user limit in the "Personal Edition" of UnixWare
2.1 seems to be real:

	$ telnet 172.27.101.128
	Trying 172.27.101.128...
	Connected to 172.27.101.128.
	Escape character is '^]'.


	UnixWare 2.1 (gollum1) (pts/2)

	telnetd: set_id() failed: Too many users
	.
	Connection closed by foreign host.


This thing was released in 1996. Obviously, with this limitation it could
not hold a candle to the emerging Linux tsunammi full of free source code.
