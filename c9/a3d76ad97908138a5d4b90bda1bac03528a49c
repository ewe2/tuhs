I was at the Digital Systems Research Center in Palo Alto between 1984 =
and 1989.  Also located in Palo Alto were the Western Research Lab (run =
by Forest Baskett), Workstation Systems Engineering, and the West Coast =
Systems Lab.  Steve Bourne was at one of these.

All were within a few blocks of each other and easy walking distance to =
=E2=80=9CLouis=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D chinese restaurant, whose official name =
was =E2=80=9CThe Little Restaurant=E2=80=9D.  The rule was that you =
could not go to Louis' for lunch if you had eaten lunch there the day =
before. =20

At the time, SRC was building multiprocessor research workstations with =
VAX chips (the Firefly, I did some of the hardware) and WRL was building =
an ECL RISC machine (the Titan).   WSE was started, I think, to =
commercialize a multiprocessor VAX workstation something like the =
Firefly.  WSL was a software group working on window systems and things =
like multimedia software.

The WSE machines became the VAXStation 3520 and 3540, code named FireFox =
(showing the ancestry I guess!).
The folks at WSE, I think with egging on from WRL, who were in the same =
building, then built the R2000 based =E2=80=9CPMAX=E2=80=9D and then the =
R3000 based =E2=80=9C3MAX=E2=80=9D.  These were rather nice machines for =
1990 and 1991.  They also invented a flat attaching I/O card format =
=E2=80=9CTurboChannel=E2=80=9D.  The impression I has was that the =
RS6000 and the PA-RISC and the various MIPS machines put a large scare =
into Digital.

I don=E2=80=99t know how the politics worked for this.  The west coast =
was a long long way from Maynard.
