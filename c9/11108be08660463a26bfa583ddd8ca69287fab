I find it ironic that BSD people are so quick to bash RMS, yet they
have been using his tools (gcc and various utils) for years...  By
reading this thread it appears there are more people that have
personal issues with RMS than technical ones.  I find usually there
are two sides to each story though.

One side is eloquently presented in 2001 movie "Revolution OS"[1]
starring RMS amongst others.
