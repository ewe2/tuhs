Paul.  alarm was introduced as part of Unix/TS would become most of kernel f=
or the V7 system


As for networking driving it I can not say. But the need for alarm to be bro=
ken from sleep was there for many other types of programs particularly if th=
ere was an interactive component or you needed to deal with hw at the user l=
evel. =20

Look at the =E2=80=98expect=E2=80=99 code in uucico (which would later begat=
 the whole expect tool from NIST).   Alarm was just easier to do that with t=
han sleep.=20
