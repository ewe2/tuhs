Claude Shannon passed away on this day in 2001.

Regarded as the Father of Information Theory, I doubt whether you'll go 
through a day without bumping into him: computers, electronics, file 
compression, audio sampling, you name it and he was probably behind it.

Please take a moment to remember him.
