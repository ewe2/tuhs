Yeah slices? A: b: c: d: e:?  But C: is the whole drive??? I had some really old BSD book that talks about needing 4 people to install a harddisk as they were so heavy, and talking about it’s massive ‘500MB’ capacity (Eagle drive on a VAX?) but it certainly didn’t fit in the DOS / OS/2 / Windows NT world.

And OS/2 was so much like MS-DOS needing to reboot and so clunky, while Windows NT let you partition at will, and even concatenating disks, or setting up software raid with absolute ease it made you wonder why it always was so difficult on anything else.

Now that brings up another reason why I think Linux won. Most of the early Linux developers were 
educated partly in the MS/PC/DR DOS world. They wanted a Unix, but they had bought IBM PC clones 
with MS DOS and were familiar with the DOS way of doing things.

Linux's disk partitioning is very familiar to anyone who's familiar with the DOS way of disk partitioning. 
BSD's disk partitioning is a culture shock. (I know. I'd gotten used to the DOS way of doing things after 
learning about disk partitioning with my 486 and IBM OS/2 - the hard way. I tried Linux and the 
terminology was the same and due to a neat trick with the DOS filesystem I could experiment with it on 
an unchanged DOS system. I then tried FreeBSD and I didn't understand the terminology. So I stuck with 
what I'd learnt.)

FWLIW :)
