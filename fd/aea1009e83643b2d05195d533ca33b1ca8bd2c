I'd like to point out that the more steps that are taken to factor out 
identifier names, whitespace conventions, etc, the closer you approach a 
situation where the tool says "both programs are written in the same 
programming language" or "both programs use binary searching somewhere in 
their code".  Which, while true, isn't terribly useful to know.  A human 
being still needs to wade through the results and inspect them manually.

Cheers,

Rhys Weatherley.
