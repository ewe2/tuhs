	It would be easy enough to do - or perhaps a critical one was
	left out.    Filesystems without device nodes can be moved
	with a 'tar' pipeline but the root filesystem is special.

	Ah ha!

	Look at the /VERSION file.  The first or second line will have
	the patchlevel.   That file's updated by each patch.
