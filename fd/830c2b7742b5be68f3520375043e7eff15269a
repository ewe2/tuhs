the transition from wet to dry was amazing. we had the wet, and it
worked but was fussy. I think it was some odd DPI like 120. Lowish
res. Jaggies on the fonts. I printed a poem Dave Barron wrote about
the birth of the ICL 2900 hundred in old english font, you can see the
jaggies on it. When it first comes out, it is shiny like its just been
given birth to (sorry) and some horrendous solvent I don't want to
think about evaporated, and it was done. Sort-of shiny surface. Not
very nice.

The first decent dry laser we got was a canon unit, which IIRC was in
that olivetti "we know how do do design" space-age orange shade. It
was a giant brick on its end, about the height of a bar-fridge, and it
was 200dpi I think, and we loved it. Insanely good to get things that
clean, and not have to slice a roll of paper. I mean, for the entire
time we've been talking about Xerox machines were coming down in size
although a campus printer at the bindery for PhDs is an assembly line
of giant car sized units, but even the small ones the engineers have a
black diver case of wierd tools, gizmos to reach behind the
thingamajig and tickle the whatsit with a hairy brush.. they are
seriously complex machines (or were). Getting one of these
russian-tanks in a jet-age orange italian designer bar-fridge was ..
cool.

But then.. we realised all the s/w tools we were using were designed
for US letter. Inches. Not A4 friendly. I mean, the BSD licence I've
referred to several times, It was printed on legal, it even had the
honest-to-god crimped red seal of the regents of the university of
california on it, we didn't have envelopes which fitted this stuff. We
didn't have ring binders with holes in the right places for the
printed manuals, and when we printed our own, if we didn't check and
check and check, the US-Legal / A4 thing went bananas. People hoarded
magic init sequences to make things have margins and page sizes which
worked for them. I still remember trying to co-erce 2up printing to
work nicely.

We were so desperate for decent output there was a market for a sort
of 'player piano' box which sat on an IBM golfball printer, and
hammered the keys for you. Daisy wheel was good, but you can't beat an
IBM selectric if you want to cut a roneostat for some agitprop (they
were the invention of the devil too. the ink goes everywhere)

Nowadays, a good photocopier from fuji has a 48MP camera with a giant
lens, there is none of this scanning nonsense, its one photo and done.
The smarts are in MIPS chips and do things like hide 'you leaked it'
codes in the printed output. I used one to copy my passport for a
re-issuance recently, I swear you could pass money from them (I am
told they have image recognition for money and won't print it. Damn
skynet. they're taking over already)
