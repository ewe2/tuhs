The problem isn't so much the hardware, it's the software.  A USB stack
(OHCI/UHCI) isn't exactly small and I doubt you could create a driver
stack that would fit in a PDP-11's 16 bit address space (ie TCP/IP is a
stretch in that it only works on systems with 22-bit addressing and I'd
say that a USB stack is *at least* as complicated as a TCP/IP stack).
