​Not sure how to answer this.​  It was an IBM product and could be used
with a lot of other IBM's products.  Generally speaking it was aimed at the
Educational market, although there were some commercial customers, for
instance Intel was reputed to do a lot of the 486 simulation on a TCF
cluster (I don't know that for sure, that was before I worked for Intel).

​Clearly, if you had a PS/2 in the cluster, that was your access point.   I
think it was all mixed up in the politics of the day at IBM between
Enterprise, Workstations, and Entry systems.  TCP/IP and Ethernets were not
something IBM wanted to use naturally.    But the Educational market did
use it and certainly some folks at IBM saw the value.

UNIX was needed for the Education market as was TCP/IP so that going to be
the pointed head of the stick.
