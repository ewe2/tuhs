You bring up a valid point.  Something I've not specifically thought 
about before, mainly because I've not wanted to maintain a MLM.

I see no reason that the hypothetical MLM that I'm alluding to couldn't 
re-use the message ID or at least cite it in the References: header 
rather than making something arbitrary up.

I think that would help with the problem that you're describing.

I'm sorry.  That makes me believe that the list has failed in it's 
purpose of enabling communications.  :-(
