Subject: 2.9BSD/DZ-11 clone screw
Message-ID: <13407312462.14.DSEAGRAV@toad.xkl.com>

I got my hands on a Aviv DZ-11 clone.  16-line MUX.  So, I go about
shoving it in the 83.  It boots 2.9BSD off a RL02.  Shove device in,
set CSR and interrupt vector, and fire up BSD.
I screwed with the dtab line - With it using dzdma in place of dzou, I can't
make the MUX go.  The kernel attaches it, but I can't seem to be able to talk
to it.  So, I switched to dzou.  Now, upon boot, I get the message:

dz 0 csr 160100 vector 320 no address found for dzou
SERIOUS CONFIGURATION ERROR^G^G^G

I've tried other vectors and other bus slots, and get no improvements
with either method (dzdma or dzou).  Any ideas?

(Oh, and if you've got another SDZV11, the DIP switches are BACKWARDS of their
labels!  1=0 and 0=1.  Cute, eh?)

I also have a DHV11, but no idea how to tell BSD it's there.
All I ever get from it is

dh ? csr 160020 vector 370 didn't interrupt

I think I need to set the DM address, but have no idea what to set it to.

	How are you trying to talk to it?  If the line is marked as "modem
	controlled" you will see/hear nothing until there is 'CD' (carrier
	detect) present. 

	Typically the /dev nodes are "modem controlled" unless you add 0200
	(128 dec) to the minor device number.

	For 2.9 the major device number of the DZ is 21 so /dev/tty00 would
	be "mknod /dev/tty00 c 21 0" and expect modemcontrol while
	"mknod /dev/tty00 c 21 128" would be a "hardwired" line w/o modem
	control.

	That's not surprising since there is no such symbol in the DZ driver ;)

	'dzdma' is a replacement for the transmit interrupt routine - the
	xmit interrupt goes to 'dzdma' (IF 'DZ_DMA' is enabled in the kernel
	config file).  'dzdma' calls 'dzxint' at the end of dzdma's processing.

	Thus if you change 'dzdma' to anything it should be to 1) a symbol
	which exists <grin> and 2) 'dzxint'.

	I think something bad happens if DZ_DMA is enabled but dzxint is
	called directly - it probably won't work since there are two different
	'dzxint' routines (one for use with dzdma and one without and the
	args are different).  So if the symbol 'dzdma' is present in the
	kernel you probably want to least the "xmit field" in /etc/dtab
	as 'dzdma'.  If 'dzdma' is not present in the kernel then use 'dzxint'.

	Try remaking the device nodes to indicate no modem control. Or perhaps
	create a cable that asserts the necessary signals.

	Quite so.  The original 2.9BSD didn't support the DHV or DHU devices.
	Later on there were drivers created but the original distributions
	lack (according to the CSRG archive CDs) 'dhv' and 'dhu' support.  The
	closest 2.9 came was the venerable DH/DM.

	2.11BSD does have DHV support but the silo handling of those devices
	is *terrible*.  If you have any choice in the matter at all get a
	DHQ-11 and set it for 'DHU' mode.  The DHQ can run in DHV  or
	DHU modes with the latter being far preferable (its behaviour is that
	of the older DH-11 with regard to silo alarm level selectability).

> I think I need to set the DM address, but have no idea what to set it to.

	Not for a DHV.  An older DH/DM you would have needed to but that is
	one of the differences (and why the DHV isn't compatible with the DH
	driver) is how modem signals are handled.  On a 2.11BSD system there
	is a single line:

	dhv     ? 160440 310    5       dhvrint dhvxint # dhv terminal mux

	for the DHV-11.  Where the CSR/Vector were set to whatever didn't
	conflict with something else.

	Good Luck.
