I=E2=80=99m not sure I buy his arguments.    First off, he argues that a =
true low level language requires knowledge of the =E2=80=9Cirrelevant=E2=80=
=9D and then he goes and argues that with C you need such knowledge on =
other than a PDP-11.
His arguemnt that whowever he surveyed is ignorant of how C handles =
padding is equally pointless.     Further, his architecture world seems =
to be roughly limited to PDP-11=E2=80=99s and Intel x86 chips.

I=E2=80=99ve ported UNIX to a number of machines from the Denelcor HEP =
MIMD supercomputer to various micros from x86 to i860 etc=E2=80=A6  In =
addition, I=E2=80=99ve ported high performance computer graphics =
applications to just about every UNIX platform aailable (my app is =
pretty much an OS into itself) including the x86 of various flavors, =
MIPS, 68000, Sparc, Stellar, Ardent, Apollo DN1000, HP9000, iTanium, =
Alpha, PA RISC, i860 (of various configurations), etc=E2=80=A6   All =
done in C.   All done with exacting detail.   Yes, you do have to =
understand the underlying code being generated, and such is not as bad =
as he thinks.    In fact, all his arguments argue that C does fit his =
definition of the low level language.
