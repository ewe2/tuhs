I'd recommend you look into the Quasijarus project at
http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/Quasijarus/

and join their mailing list by sending a request to Michael Sokolov:

Cheers,

Two RD54s? At least one of them must be external then, as there's only room for
one full-height device in the VS2K box itself. I'm going to assume that you
have the standard DEC configuration with one RD54 internal and an expansion
adapter (pizza box) at the bottom with the 2nd external RD54 connected to it.
Hey, except for the lack of TK50Z, you've got pretty much the maximum
configuration from DEC for VS2K: maximum memory, maximum number of disks of
top-of-the-line type, expansion adapter, and top-of-the-line graphics card!

On your expansion adapter, right next to the connector for the external RD54,
you should see a 50-lead Amphenol (aka Centronics) SCSI connector. It is indeed
real SCSI, but the boot ROM, VMS, and Ultrix only support one SCSI device on
it, the TK50Z.

> I also don't have a TK50 or any external storage,

Note that if you can get hold of a TK50Z (a box just like your external RD54,
but with a TK50 drive and a TK50-to-SCSI adapter inside), you can readily plug
it into the connector I just described. I don't think a TK50Z would be that
expensive. Here in Dallas, TX, USA I get bare TK50 drives for $75 apiece and
TK50 drive + TQK50 controller (for Q-bus) pairs for $100 apiece, and I don't
think a TK50Z would be much more expensive.

> so it looks like I'll be netbooting.

Sorry, can't help you with that, I and netbooting have never been able to
successfully coexist in the same machine room at the same time.

If you have VMS running on one disk, you can use it to install Ultrix on the
other. Talk to me directly for the instructions.

Thanks, Warren, for helping me out with awareness-raising! I have to disappoint
Jeff a little bit, though, that 4.3BSD-Quasijarus support for BabyVAXen is
still a while away, but trust me, we will get there some day! But my project
pages and mailing list are definitely a tremendous resource.

NetBSD runs on the VS2000. A friend is running a Web-server on a VS2000
(http://wmad93.mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de/). But the MFM disk support
is broken since 1.4 due to a DMA code cleanup. Netbooting works and you
can connect any generic SCSI disk to the tape port. This works but is
very slow because there is only PIO SCSI on the VS2000...

Don't remember seeing any. What do you want to know?
