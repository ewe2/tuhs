I think the problem is before then.  You need to have the baud rate set before the shell is forked.  For serial ports like DZ and DH that is done in by the values of /etc/ttys   

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.

I looked at the source code for stty.c (briefly) and it looks like it oughta work, if ioctl works... other things work ok nl, cr, etc., just speed doesn't have an effect... When I get home later, I'll prolly try putting some print statments in stty.c to see what it thinks it's doing. Here's what I see on the command line in the console:

Using the j and k keys work better and when I scroll down enough lines, the lines move                     up to fill the whole terminal window and the file can be edited in the full window. Is there a better                     TERM setting that will get 24 lines to show up on file open?
