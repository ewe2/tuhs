My BASIC experience came from the HP/2000 (and the HP/3000) systems the=20
Prince George's County (MD) schools had at the time.     When I moved on=20
to Johns Hopkins, I was sent a letter in advance of my freshman year=20
from professor Bill Huggins who taught one of the freshman EE classes.  =20
The class was to use Basic  Plus on a PDP-11/45s using the UNIX=20
operating system.    Now at this point, I had a friend whose mother=20
worked in the local DEC (Lanham, MD) office and would let us raid the=20
stock room for things like processor handbooks and the like.    I was=20
able to find out about Basic Plus and PDP-11/45 but I was unable to find=20
anything about this UNIX thing.

Of course, once I got there I found that the EE computer center was=20
largely run by students under the name of the Undergraduate Computer=20
Society.   Mike Muuss was in charge and they had made a deal that if=20
they could get BasicPlus migrated over from RSTS, they could run UNIX on=20
the machine.    It turned out not to be that difficult.   RSTS, like=20
most DEC OSes, for some reason used EMT for the system calls (contrary=20
to what the processor handbook would recommend).   UNIX used TRAP.  =20
This means all they had to do is emulate a few RSTS calls.    In=20
addition, the only change I believe was to add a system call that=20
disabled the UNIX idea of stack management (Basic Plus like many DEC=20
programs of the day used a relatively small stack in low memory because=20
the actual register saves, etc... were stored elsewhere, it was just=20
function call linkage).   The system call was obviously called=20
"nostack."

This hadn't been Mike's only foray into Basic.    He had his own IBM=20
1130 and had written a Basic interpretter under contract for the=20
Baltimore County Public Schools.   I remember sitting in the "KSR room"=20
at Hopkins and watching him preparing the invoice for payment.
Please remit $3000, no stamps please.    That last part caused a bit of=20
consternation at the school district.

Amusingly, I have my little Raspberry Pi scale model 11/70 front panel=20
churning away on my desk.    I can switch it from booting up various=20
UNIXes (mostly I run 2.9 BSD hacked to somewhat look like JHU UNIX) and=20
RSTS which reinforces why we used to refer to it as the Really Sh-tty=20
Timesharing System.
