BitSavers seems to be the canonical location for old computer documentation.

The CHWiki (gunkies.org) isn't really the best place to put original documentation,
but that's where I'd recommend putting meta-data. As for searching meta-data, are
you speaking of something more powerful than Google?

PS: Speaking of old Unix documentation, I recently acquired a paper copy of the
PDP-11 V6 Unix manual. Is that something I should scan? I don't know if you
already have it (I know where to find sources in the archives, but I don't
know where documentation scans live.)
