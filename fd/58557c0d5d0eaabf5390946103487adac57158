I think you're probably right, but with an important caveat:

It's important to remember that 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... represent editions of
the *manual*, and that there is no guarantee that any particular
snapshot of the system corresponds exactly to what was in any particular
manual edition.  Research Unix (as it was later called retrospectively)
was right up to the end a continuously evolving system, and the whole
concept of releases simply did not exist for it.

So when the CACM article was written, it probably specified what the
kernel was doing that particular day, without reference to any edition.
