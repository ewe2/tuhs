I love to tell a story about the Sex, Drugs and UNIX button.   I'm in my
disheveled tee-shirt/jeans and wearing one of those button in the elevator
in hotel in Toronto talking with a couple of my co-workers: Al Nugent and
Mike Krueger; when your basic American midwestern family gets on.
Remember this is right when AIDS epidemic is just making into in the press.
  The mother sees the button and asks, "What a UNIX?"  Krueger brightly
replies:  "It like AIDS, only worse."   She immediately grabs her kids and
cowers in the corner of the elevator.

I'm shaking my head in disgust and turned  to Krueger and called him the
"#$%^& Prince of Darkness."  By this point, Nugent is laughing riotously.
 FYI the name stuck.   Even today when I see folks from Masscomp and folks
ask what happened to person X or Y,  - "The #$%^& Prince of Darkness" is
still referred too by that term of endearment.

Clem
