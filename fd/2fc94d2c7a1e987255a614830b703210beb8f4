Memories of running Mistress/Empress under CTIX come flooding back ...

Back in the day (circa 1987) I recall Henry Spencer was going out with a 
woman who worked at Rhodnius (what that the name? it's been a while) on 
the commercial product.  While Henry has vanished from the face of the 
Earth (it seems), Geoff Collyer might recall who she was, or maybe have 
pointers/links to others who worked on the code.
