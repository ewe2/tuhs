Well, definitely not BSDI, who closed down about 5 years ago.  But you
could try Wind River Systems, who bought them out before closing them
down.

It's not impossible; I have a complete BSD/OS 5.x tree somewhere which
was given to me during my work on the FreeBSD SMPng project, which
based on code from BSD/OS.  I'm not at liberty to distribute it,
unfortunately, but the impression I got at the time (2000) was that it
wouldn't be too difficult to get code if you had a reason.
