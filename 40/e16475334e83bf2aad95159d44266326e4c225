boot dl0
@boot       <- you type "boot" and press "enter" or "return" in reply
New Boot, known device are hp ht rk rl rp tm vt
: rl(0,0)rl2unix    <- you type "rl(0,0)rl2unix" and press return
mem = 177856
#           <- you are now in "single user" mode
            <- press "control-d" to go to multiuser mode

login: root     <- login as "root"
#           <- Have fun ...

            <-  right?  ;-)

If you want to make things easier,  your first command should be:

# cp /rl2unix /unix

Now you will be able to type "rl(0,0)unix" instead of "rl(0,0)rl2unix".  Ps
and other commands that need to read the system namelist also expect the
kernel image to be named /unix.

Enjoy!
