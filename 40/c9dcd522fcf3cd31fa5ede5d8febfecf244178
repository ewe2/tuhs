Does anyone here remember the Adventure Shell?

Doug wrote it back in 83, and I just stumbled across a copy in an RCS directory.

Invoked as ‘ash’ it was pretty clever.  I’ve lost the instructions and help files, however I’ve got the main script.

Back when people did weird things because it was fun.
