Speaking of X on Heritage Unix I have a Sun 3/60M with the 1280x1024 monochrome
display.  The only display server I have ever gotten to work on it is on NetBSD
1.3 running the pre-XFree86 X11R6.

I'm wondering if there are any older UNIXes I could use.  Does Sun still keep
SunOS 4 under wraps or can it be used for non-commerical purposes at no cost?
