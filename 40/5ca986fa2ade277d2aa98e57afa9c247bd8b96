I just happened to open a binder today of old papers about UNIX(tm),
including Ken Thompson's "Unix Implementation" paper, which says at the
bottom of the introduction:

  "What is or is not implemented in the kernel represents both a great
  responsibiity and a great power.  It is a soap-box platform on "the
  way things should be done."  Even so, if "the way" is too radical, no
  one will follow it.  Every important decision was weighted carefully.
  Throughout, simplicity has been substituted for efficiency.  Complex
  algorithms are used only if their complexity can be localized."
