It seems like "http://www.cs.bell-labs.com" is down.  Doesn't seem to be
DMR specific.

But it is cause to reflect on all that bell labs brought us.  What a great
place!  When I was going through grad school, bell labs was _the_ place to
be.  I read their papers, watched what they did, and I knew I didn't have
a chance in hell of getting in there (my Dad did physics and a lot of those
guys did physics and while newtonian mechanics and I got along just fine,
it all went south after that.)

I can tell you that I really wanted to be there.  I suspect there are many
here who feel the same way.
