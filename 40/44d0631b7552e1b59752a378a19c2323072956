If you grab the latest svn sources the process is a lot simpler.
You just have to

        cd build
        make
        <cp extra files into root or usr>
        rm protofs
        make install

but the extra commands aren't necessary because in the latest Makefile
we're installing /usr/src with the commands sources and /usr/sys with
the kernel sources.
