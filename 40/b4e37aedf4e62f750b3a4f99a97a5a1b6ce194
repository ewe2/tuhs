More information about the /usr migration, can be found at:

* https://wiki.debian.org/UsrMerge
* https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/TheCaseForTheUsrMerge/

One of the interesting points made in the above is that merging /bin
and /usr/bin, et. al., was first done by Solaris 11 (ten years ago)
and so one of the arguments for Linux distributions for proceeding
with the /usr merge was to improve cross compatibility with legacy
commercial Unix systems.

So obviously, like so many other things, it's all Oracle's fault.  :-)
