Spurred on by Bryan, I thought I should properly introduce myself:

I am a fairly young Unix devotee, having gotten my start with System V =
on a Wang word processing system (believe it or not, they made one!), at =
my mother=E2=80=99s office, in the late 1980s. My first personal system, =
which ran SLS Linux, came about in 1992.

I am a member of the Vintage Computing Federation, and have given talks =
and made exhibits on Unix history at VCF=E2=80=99s museum, in Wall, New =
Jersey. I have also had the pleasure to show Brian Kernighan and Ken =
Thompson, who are two of my computing heroes, my exhibit on the origins =
of BSD Unix on the Intel 386. I learned C from Brian=E2=80=99s book, as =
probably did many others here.

I have spent my entire professional career supporting Unix, in some form =
or another. I started with SunOS at the National Institutes of Health, =
in Bethesda, Maryland, and moved on to Solaris, HP-UX, SCO, and finally =
Linux. I worked for AT&T, in Virginia, in the early 2000s, but there =
were few vestiges of Unix present, other than some 3b1 and 3b2 monitors =
and keyboards.=20

I current work for Red Hat, in Tyson=E2=80=99s Corner, Virginia, as a =
principal sales engineer, where I spend most of my time teaching and =
presenting at conferences, both in person and virtual.

Thank you to everyone here who created the tools that have enabled my =
career and love of computing!
