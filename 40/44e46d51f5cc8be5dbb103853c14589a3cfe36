No offense taken.  It's not so much that it's "likeable", at least, any
more than playing with any old software is "likeable".  It only crossed
my radar because someone mentioned that it was available for Atari UNIX
(ASV), would those bits be able to be used on Amiga UNIX (AMIX)?  I was
able to pull the bits off the ASV images and get them running on AMIX,
but it requires setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to load the ASV X11 libs, so, I
thought, if I could get my hands on the source, I could compile it 
against
the AMIX supplied libs, then maybe try and get Mosaic compiled as well.
