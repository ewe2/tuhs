Subject: [TUHS] Status of, and licensing of the so called "Ancient UNIX" products
Message-ID: <002401c2ddd8$af4e1680$38c5580c@who5>

Hello again from Gregg C Levine
I know I asked this question early on, and I remember, and have the
original answer filed someplace.... But that was about a year ago.
Since then I had heard a rumor that the current Copyright Owner of the
"Ancient UNIX" products had in fact re-released the products under the
exact same license that both Minix, and BSD use.

 In fact they could called a freely releasable product. Can someone on
this list confirm this? On a different list, for a different emulator,
to which that I belong, we there, are having a discussion regarding
the status of these products. I agreed with a correspondent that the
BSD ones, such as 2.11, and 2.9 were in fact freely available, pending
a response that is. 

I am suggesting there, that someone should investigate porting either
V5, or V6, or even V7 to that platform. And someone naturally is
making that complaint. Someone else is also claiming that Amdahl did
just that, and sold it under the name UTS. But as you might guess, it
is not freely available.
