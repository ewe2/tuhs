I know him as well, he send various personal attacks against me....when I tried 
to discuss Linux kernel bugs on LKML or made proposals on how problems could 
be fixed - e.g. the Linux kernel include files that are needed for various user 
space programs but these include files did not compile with user space 
programs. 

He told me that what I proposed was nonsense, but 5 years later, they 
implemented my proposal.

As Linux personally and incorrectly claimed that I was talking about kernel 
internal interfaces even though I was definitely talking about 
kernel/userspace interfaces, I assume that he has a problem with understanding
what an external interface is.

You may have had luck.

You also may have used only those interfaces that are not Linux specific but 
rather UNIX interfaces that cannot be changed without protest from thousands of 
people. Let me assume that you are talking about BitKeeper SCCS, then it is 
obvious that you do not need to use Linux specific interfaces in your software.

You may have started with Linux later than I did - I started in 1996.

My software implements support for many Linux specific interfaces (*) and I 
have been a victim of incompatible interface changes many times.

Fortunately, I have no longer been hit since 5 years.


*) star e.g. implements support for Linux specific file meta data and 
   cdrtools e.g need to implement pass through SCSI.
