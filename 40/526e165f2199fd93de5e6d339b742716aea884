Please don't do that.  There is no value in being Sys V ABI compliant and
the original a.out work very well.  I've used it for two and a half
decades now, and still use it on Plan 9.  There just needs to be magic
numbers for the various formats.  I would suggest looking at the
10Edition information for things that arn't as they currently are.

There are a couple of options here.  One is to use one of the compilers
from MIT that will match the code in 32V very closely.  You can google for
these if they aren't already on Warren's site.  The other option
is to use LCC.  I wouldn't use GCC if I were doing it.  (Of course I'm not
so these are just suggestions.)

I'm not sure if the current trademark owners can retro actively
disassociate a mark after the fact.  If it WAS Unix 32V it still IS Unix 
32v.
I suppose if you do much more than port it to Intel one could argue
that it's not Unix 32V anymore.
