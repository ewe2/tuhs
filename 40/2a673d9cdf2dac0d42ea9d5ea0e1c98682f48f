I must admit that this is an interesting thread, just as long as it wasn't 
called XXoptimize() unless you wanted a backlash from British English 
speakers :-)

In hindsight I suppose that XXstrategy() is obvious, but back then, as you 
ask?  Dunno, but Ken might (if he's reading this thread).

One of my favo[u]rites is sched(); some pronounce it as "shed" and others 
as "sked".  Another American/British thing, I think...

Wasn't it Mark Twain who said "Two nations divided by a common language"?

I no longer have my Lions books on me, sadly enough (lost in a house move) 
but there certainly were some peculiar names in the kernel...

ObGripe: Could anyone replying to the digest version please take the 
trouble to update the Subject: line accordingly?  I've now put the 
original back as a courtesy to others, but I shouldn't have to; it's as 
bad as top-posting.
