And there you missed your cue :-) From swtch() in sys/ken/slp.c:

	/*
	 * If the new process paused because it was
	 * swapped out, set the stack level to the last call
	 * to savu(u_ssav).  This means that the return
	 * which is executed immediately after the call to aretu
	 * actually returns from the last routine which did
	 * the savu.
	 *
	 * You are not expected to understand this.
