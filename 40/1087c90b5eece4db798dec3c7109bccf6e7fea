That was my first machine too (well, a PDP-12, which was really a
hybrid PDP-8/LINC-8, but I only used the PDP-8 instructions).  That
was a nice, compact instruction set.  It has the great advantage that
I can still remember just about every instruction today.  Remember the
autoincrement registers?  Even in those days they looked like a
kludge, but they helped a lot.

It's funny how long octal clung on.  It should have gone away with 8
bit bytes.  But somehow I still have a soft spot for octal, and
numbers like 7778 still look wrong.

Hmm.  Am I expected to understand this?  Seriously, I don't know how
many people really wrote anything like swtch ().
