	I just heard that, after a long illness, Dennis Ritchie (dmr)
	died at home this weekend. I have no more information. I trust
	there are people here who will appreciate the reach of his
	contributions and mourn his passing appropriately. He was a quiet
	and mostly private man, but he was also my friend, colleague,
	and collaborator, and the world has lost a truly great mind.

With great thanks and appreciation to him,
