Angelo Papenhoff <aap@papnet.eu> writes about the conversion of

The most important other one is that used by the TeX typesetting
system: 72.27pt is one inch.  TeX calls the Adobe PostScript one a big
point: 72bp == 1in.  Here is what Don Knuth, TeX's author, wrote on
page 58 of The TeXbook (Addison-Wesley, 1986, ISBN 0-201-13447-0):

Here sp is a scaled point: 65536sp = 1pt.  The distance 1sp is smaller
than the wavelength of visible light, and is thus not visible to
humans.

TeX represents physical dimensions as integer numbers of scaled
points, or equivalently, fixed-point numbers in points, with a 16-bit
fraction.  With a 32-bit word size, that leaves 16 bits for the
integer part, of which the high-order bit is a sign, and the adjacent
bit is an overflow indicator.  That makes TeX's maximum dimension on
such machines 1sp below 2^14 (= 16,384) points, or about 5.75 meters
or 18.89 feet.
