Ah, so the Pierce loop was operational several years before the papers =

The Spider report has a section on the protocol for making/breaking =
connections dynamically, but this is not used in the surviving programs =
which hard code a destination (channel). I wondered about that when Noel =
first found the sources for =E2=80=99nfs=E2=80=99. Maybe this connection =

The video that Sandy Fraser recorded has a segment about that at 25:30. =
Apparently, just before Christmas Ed David gave him $60K budget to buy a =
computer to build the Spider switch. The catch was that it had to be =

could be shipped in that time frame.
