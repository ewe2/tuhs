Sure thing.

By the way: the thing I was thinking about earlier that was so biting
towards OOP was an earlier version of Harper's post, in which he writes,
"Object-oriented programming is eliminated entirely from the introductory
curriculum, because it is both anti-modular and anti-parallel by its very
nature, and hence unsuitable for a modern CS curriculum."
https://web.archive.org/web/20110321004746/https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/teaching-fp-to-freshmen/
(How's _that_ for an academic glove-slap?)

It would appear that language was softened to read "unsuitable for our
purposes" sometime in 2013, and then that rather inflammatory clause was
removed entirely by early March, 2015. I had read the original and felt
some schadenfreude.
