Subject: [TUHS] NeWS, anybody?
Message-ID: <200710132323.58827.wes.parish@paradise.net.nz>

groklaw has some details about Yet Another SCO-Group-ism:
http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071011205044141
that appears to be about windowing systems.

I'm wondering, would Sun's NeWS be of any value or interest in this situation?  
And if so, does anyone have suitably detailed SDKs, DDKs, whathaveyou, of 
NeWS?  (It would be nice if Sun would release it plus source code to TuHS 
under a suitable license ... but though dreams are free, they don't fill the 
belly ;)
