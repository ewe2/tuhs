nroff was in v2; troff appeared in v4, which incidentally was
typeset in troff.

Because of Joe Ossanna's role in designing the model 37, we
had 37's in the Labs and even in our homes right from the
start of production. But when they went obsolete, they were
a chore to get rid of. As Labs property, they had to be
returned; and picking them up was nobody's priority.
Andy Hall had one on his back porch for a year.
