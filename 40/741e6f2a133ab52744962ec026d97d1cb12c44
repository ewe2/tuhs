I think it might have been in the original COFF which came from those days, but its possible its from one of the many bastardization of COFF that occurred after its birth.    I don't remember it being in any of the a.out flavors and I don't think macho has it.

I’m not sure if Clem meant to type “Sun or IBM where Larry or Charlie” … 

I don’t readily find any documentation or history older than AIX 4.2, well beyond my tenure, but I believe we had shared libraries from the very beginning with AIX on the RT, presumably based on a.out. My recollection is that this was driven by (late) Larry Loucks, with assistance from Jack O’Quin and several of the ISC folks.
