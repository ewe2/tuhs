Not that I know of. But Charlie Brown's office did use it.
Brown, the CEO of AT&T, did not like wearing reading glasses
when he made a speech, so his speechwriters produced the
text in large type. Once they were into document preparation
they began to use our machine for other things. When I
discovered that confidential minutes of AT&T board meetings
were in our file system, I told them the facts of life
about computer security, especially at the center of the
UUCP universe, and persuaded the executive suite to get
its own machine.
