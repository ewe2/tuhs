Nobody claimed that.  I claimed, based on what I've been told by people
who programmed in lisp and some small personal experience, that lisp 
was and is perceived as a slow language, certainly slower than C.

Lisp fans hate that claim because they want everyone to program in Lisp,
or at least let them program in lisp.

I tipped my hat to the belief, I've never experience it myself but I've
heard it claimed, that a skilled lisp coder solves problems, especially
compiler like problems, in lisp faster than a skilled C programmer would.

I think that reality is that lispers like lisp because they can claim
they are "done" faster than they would if they had to do the same thing
in C (or other procedural) languages.

That is a HORRIBLE reason to like a language.  In my not at all
humble opinion.  If lisp were a language that was easy to read, for all
programmers not just people who love lisp, OK, maybe.  But it is not,
it's a miserable language to scan and understand.  Contrast it with C or
go or any of other procedural languages.  Any programmer can read C
and quickly understand what it is doing.  The same is not true of 
lisp.

I strongly suspect that lisp people optimize for speed of writing 
whereas most experienced people optimize for the speed of reading.
It's write one, read many.

But not lisp.  Or at least, nobody wants to take up my grep challenge.

P.S.  For the record, I tried to like lisp.  I wrote lisp programs,
I tried.  Just like I tried to like emacs.  I'm apparently not smart
enough to join the hallowed grounds where the lispers live.  C/vi for
stupid me.
