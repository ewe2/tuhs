We were big into =E2=80=9CAdventure=E2=80=9D when I first started on =
UNIX.    It wasn=E2=80=99t until someone handed me the Fortran source =
code did I find we had missed a few things in it (like the rusty rods =
with black stars).

=20

Rogue was a popular one later.  =20

=20

Later at BRL we got a copy of =E2=80=9CEmpire=E2=80=9D from PSL.   The =
good thing about that game was that your amount of activity was limited =
to one hour a day and however many BTUs (Bureaucratic Time Units) your =
capital generated.    However, people would print maps near the end of =
their session and then spend hours planning the next day=E2=80=99s =
activity.   Finally, the lab management had us shutdown.

=20

There was another multiplayer game called =E2=80=9CSearch=E2=80=9D that =
would result around 4:30 in the afternoon someone yelling =
=E2=80=9CSearch Up=E2=80=9D which was everybody=E2=80=99s cue to join in =
the game.

=20

Then we got SGI workstations.   The flight simulator had a dogfight =
feature but it used some networking that didn=E2=80=99t work on our =
network (I think it was XNS broadcasts).   Fortunately, the source code =
was available so I hacked it to communicate via TCP/IP to a central =
server (which had its own =E2=80=9Cair traffic control=E2=80=9D display =
for my own benefit).    At 4:30 everybody would head off to an SGI =
workstation and we=E2=80=99d have many people flying.

We had the problem of people hanging out around the runway (where new =
players appeared) and nailing people as soon as they showed up.   I =
wrote an automated =E2=80=9Canti-aircraft gun=E2=80=9D that shot at =
people who hung out around the airfield.

=20

I was at a meeting (probably IETF) and the NASA AMES guys (who had tons =
of these workstations as well) found out about my work and made me FTP =
it to them right then and there.    There went NASA productivity.

=20

BRL had a vector graphics system in the early days called a Vector =
General.   They were left over from a project with the Cyber mainframe =
that never worked.   The labs had three or four of these things, each a =
PDP-11/34 with the Vector General, a card reader, a printer, a DQ-11, =
and a 50K modem.   At a loss for what to do with them, we put UNIX on =
them.   Mike used the system to develop the BRL CAD package.    The =
printers got used for other purposes.   The card readers pretty much =
were trashed but we kept one to convert old COMGEOM decks.   We actually =
used the DQ-11/50K modem things to extend the BRLNet (and ultimately the =
BRL gateways).

One evening, Mike and I decided to write a game for the thing.    We =
decided to simulate the =E2=80=9CAsterioids=E2=80=9D arcade game.   Mike =
did the graphics work and I wrote the game logic.    We spent all night =
writing it and then went home in the morning leaving it running.     By =
the time we came in later in the day, several of the BRL researchers =
(physicists and aerodynamics guys) had hacked on the game logic to make =
it more realistic (conservation of momentum and all that).
