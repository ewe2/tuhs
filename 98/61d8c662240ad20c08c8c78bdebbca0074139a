   dump is non-portable.  In general, you can only restore to the same
   kind of system as you write to.

Not entirely true...  dump and restore in NetBSD seems to be portable
among NetBSD systems at least.  I have personally restored to NetBSD/sparc
from NetBSD/alpha, a 64 bit to 32 bit conversion.  I have also restored to
NetBSD/amd64 a NetBSD/i386 dump, which is basically the other way around.
I have also read NetBSD/sparc dumps on NetBSD/i386, and it worked fine,
that would have been a byte order conversion.

I don't know how far this goes, if it is just NetBSD, or something
inherent to all 4.4BSD derived systems.
