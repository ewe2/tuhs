​Cute story but not true [and I was @ DEC working Alpha at that time].
Some facts:

A.) The SRM firmware was in C primary and Assembler and used >>UNIX<< tools
not VMS tools for development
B.) The GEM compiler (which still exists and still being developed by VMSI)
had front ends for at least (which I remember):   BLISS, C, PL/1, Pascal,
ADA, FORTRAN​, Cobol, RPG and a few others (I'll try to ask if I see any of
the old GEM guys in the Cafe' in the next few hours - they are dying off
BTW - but that's a different story).
C.) The GEM compiler has backends for,  Vax, Galaxy, MIPS, Alpha, x86
(32bit), ia64, INTEL*64 (post DEC/Compaq/HP) and I believe also ARM (I'll
need to ask if the VMSI folks come to lunch on Friday).
D.) Alpha's ran UNIX before they ran VMS BTW.  The HW debug was all UNIX.
