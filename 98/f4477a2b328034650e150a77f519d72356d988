Much of the problem, I think, is that:

1) an idealized PDP-11  (I absolutely take Warner's point that that
idealization never really existed) is a sufficiently simple model that a
Bear Of Little Brain, such as myself, can reason about what's going to
happen in response to a particular sequence of instructions, and get fairly
proficient in instructing the machine to do so in a non-geological
timeframe.

2) a modern CPU?  Let alone SoC?  Fuggedaboutit unless you're way, way
smarter than I am.  (I mean, I do realize that this particular venue has a
lot of those people in it...but, really, those are people with
extraordinary minds.)

There are enough people in the world capable of doing 1 and not 2 that we
can write software that usually mostly kinda works and often gets stuff
done before collapsing in a puddle of nasty-smelling goo.  There aren't
many people at all capable of 2, and as the complexity of systems
increases, that number shrinks.

In short, this ends up being the same argument that comes around every so
often, "why are you people still pretending that the computer is a PDP-11
when it clearly isn't?"  Because, as with the keys and the streetlight,
that's what we have available to us.  Only a grossly oversimplified model
fits into our heads.
