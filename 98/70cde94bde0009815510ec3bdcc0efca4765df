AFAIK the only "old" unix that runs on a VAXstation is Ultrix. 
None of the CSRG BSD releases runs on (non-QBus) VAXstations.
If you want a "new" Unix on your VAXstation, go with NetBSD:
http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/vax/
(I think Linux will never run well on VAXen. OpenBSD/vax works, 
but still needs some improvement.) 

And don't forget: There is always the dark side of the force: VMS. ;-)
