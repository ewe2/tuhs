Thanks to everyone who came to the celebration in Seattle!

If you missed it and want your own copy of historical (old) Usenet maps, 
you can download it now.

I have updated the PDF online to include everything that was in the 
display copy. The full copy is at http://www.stargatemuseum.org/maps/ .  
ThisPDF  is intended to be printed, because most of the pages are in 
landscape.
