If it'd be possible to run SVr4 on the 3B2 emulator, that'd be really
cool, particularly if there's a C compiler available. That would give
us long filenames and the possible ability to bootstrap some version
of GCC for C89 compatibility, and from there, maybe, to more modern
tools.

Otherwise, I can't imagine (anymore) trying to do anything on a system with
only 14 character filenames.
