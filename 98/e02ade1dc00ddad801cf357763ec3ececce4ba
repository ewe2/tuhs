That brought back memories, and to verify them, I checked the tac.c
source code in the latest GNU coreutils test release.  It says

/* Written by Jay Lepreau (lepreau@cs.utah.edu).
   GNU enhancements by David MacKenzie (djm@gnu.ai.mit.edu). */

So my memory was right that my old friend Jay was the author.  Sadly, 
we lost him in September 2008: see

Jay founded the influential Flux group in advanced networking research:
