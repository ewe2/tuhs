We used interleaving on the hard disk because a 5Mbps ST412
drive could stream data faster than typical user program could
handle (on a 5.6Mhz bus machine). We used h/w support as the
machine was already too slow to do any s/w interleaving!

Example: for an interleave of 1, at the time formatting the
disk, sector ids would be written in this sequence:
 1 8 2 9 3 A 4 B 5 C 6 D 7 E
We picked the interleave number based on some typical use
cases at the time.

The floppy driver was was a completely separate driver for
various reasons.
