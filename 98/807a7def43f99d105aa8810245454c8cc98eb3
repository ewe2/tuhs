In context, I don't think Corby's statement was meant to be taken
literally, but rather he used it as more of a colloquialism. His point was
that (at least in his perception) the bulk of the work had been done when
BTL dropped out of the project.

Fano's statements are a bit overshadowed by Corby's here, but when he
talked about each of the three participants in the Multics project at its
outset working on one project but with different goals, he stated that his
impression was that Bell Labs was interested in both the research products
as well as a production system that they actually could use. In particular,
they expected that the latter would be delivered on a specific timetable:
when the research part basically wrapped and the system still wasn't
production ready, they dropped out.

MIT started offering timesharing access on Multics in 1969. A second site
at Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, NY was operational by 1970. Honeywell
announced the 6180 running Multics as a product in 1973; throughout the 70s
things were tuned, cleaned up, and new subsystems introduced. The "New
Storage System", which started in 1973 and was delivered to customers in
1976. I think it's fair to say that, by the mid-70s, Multics had fully
transitioned from "research project" to "commercial system."

Bell Labs dropping out of Multics in 1969 was, of course, before Unix. This
raises the question, what did Bell Labs use instead? I imagine 360s and
either traditional batch processing or TSS or something?

Of course, by 1976, Unix was at 6th Edition and I can see why no one would
want to go back to Multics (or being tied to a machine costing an order of
magnitude more than a PDP-11). But one wonders what would have happened had
Multics started accepting timesharing, say, 9 months earlier than it did.

It would be interesting to hear what it was like when Bell Labs withdrew
from the Multics project. Does anyone have any stories? Perhaps Ken or
Doug? Also, what was the relationship like with the MIT people after that?
Corby et al seemed somewhat animated in insisting that Multics had been
essential to the creation of Unix, almost as if that had not been
sufficiently acknowledged; I imagine by the time this video was shot, they
must have been feeling somewhat overshadowed by the success of Unix.
