If it wasn't for Unix, it possibly would have been VMS on Alpha... Or OS/2.  Early Windows 3.x wouldn't have cut it.

Perhaps without the Unix workstations DEC might have survived.

Interesting alternate history...

Sadly no longer with us (he exited in 2011), he was forked in 1941.  Just 
think, if it wasn't for him and Ken, we'd all be running Windoze, and 
thinking it's wonderful.

A Unix bigot through and through, I remain,
