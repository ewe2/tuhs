happy new year to everyone.

that rememer the day where I was looking on IRIX killall manual in a
window which say you could "killall some_process_by_name" and try it
on a... solaris server in another window. the answer was fast :
well, humm, where is my second window ?

PS : solaris killall doesn't take args %-/
