Subject: [TUHS] why the leading under score added to function names?
Message-ID: <201202221917.q1MJHSGw013561@freefriends.org>

Hi All.

This is interesting. It shows that (apparently) early on, assembler was
viewed as the primary programming language.

It also shows the consequences a small, apparently local decision can have:
here we are 40+ years later and GCC on Windows is still preprending
underscores to function names!

In 15 minutes I helped the guy at work solve a problem he'd been working
on for two days!

Thanks everyone,

Arnold
