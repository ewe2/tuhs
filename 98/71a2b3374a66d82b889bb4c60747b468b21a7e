Just in these days we restored a PDP-11/23PLUS here at our
Museum! :) 

we had to create the power supply with a normal PC PSU and also
we made the 50Hz signal clock using a PIC. CPU is working and
we're trying to boot from a RL02 unit :) 

we're experiencing problems at our website so we have pictures
and info only on our facebook group, sorry for that.
