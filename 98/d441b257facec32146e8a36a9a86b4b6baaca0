Yeah, during my 486 days it was indeed doing stuff with disk. But I
was too happy to have this "workstation lookalike" running "Unix
lookalike" installed from dozens of floppies so I did not complained
about some minor problems.

Emacs ver.23, firefox ver. "very old". I do not trust my browsers too
much, so when I go to sleep they go to STOP freeze. The second emacs
is editing my pathetic########glorious######## wiki with org-mode,
file length about 55 megabytes, with unicodes, so the rss is multiple
of file size. I have long ago replaced konsole with roxterm. As you
can see, it eats nowhere near a gigabyte. And it does not read a whole
disk when starting. It usually goes with three tabs opened, so maybe
in your case memsize would have been bigger. I make a lot of use with
virtual desktops offered by fvwm, and when I need terminal on one of
those desktops (I usually do), I open some rxvt variation; position,
resize and keep it there for further use.

As I have only 12gigs of ram and more than half goes to ramdisk
(always doing something there, including compiling huge piles of code
from the net), so I have to keep an eye on firefox. When it goes above
2.9g of rss I usually start to fret and kill unneeded tabs. I set it
up to use only two or three fonts and completely disregard
author-provided fonts. So far, so good. Ah, and I use noscript,
too. Yet despite of all those precautions, I have to kill -STOP it,
because the mere thought that it will keep eating 50-90% of cpu while
doing nothing, well, this drives me up the wall. Likewise, back in the
past, when I saw how *idle* program (firefox) constantly wrote *gigs*
of bytes to my disk, I simply went mad. Long story short, now it only
can write to temporary place in ramdisk. It still does not stop it
from opening multiple files on disk in /tmp, deleting them and keeping
opened/deleted forever, using up my precious ram. It sometimes closes
those files, but not very often.

I usually open new pages in dillo, w3m or lynx (or curl) and use
firefox when nothing else would do. Not perfect solution - dillo has
some memory problem, so I usually have many of them opened and slash
those who grow too much. Like, 300megs for dillo is enough. Read up
all the tabs in it and kill. And it seems I have (pidof lynx|wc -w)
170 lynx processes, all kill-stopped and awaiting my
attention. Craps. Chances are I did not stopped being mad. At least
Unix command line tools allow me to measure it.

Now I am happy that I do not use systemd. Now I want to find more time
and migrate to OpenBSD. I really do (I know there are some Linux
distros which evaded systemd - for a while, but I consider a whole
Linux land to be lost already, just a matter of time, and I foresee
that OpenBSD will fall as the very last, if ever). I will sleep less
and program more. I will rewrite all my old python2x scripts in r7rs
scheme. Not really so many. Fruits of hard work shall be sweet and
plentiful.

12g for a browser. I am not criticising you, but I could say a bit
about people who made programs and websites contributing to such
sizes.
