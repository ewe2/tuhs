The OS Book I used in college in the late 80's said 'segments' to describe
the PDP-11 MMU. At least that's my memory, I can't even recall the name of
the OS book, and my cache of college textbooks has gone to good will years
ago. IIRC, it was because they were so large relative to the VAX and made
'page demand' difficult to implement.
