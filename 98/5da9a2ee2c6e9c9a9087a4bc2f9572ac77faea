some time ago I did exactly what you plan to do.
I used the original V7 tape files from Keith Bostic,
which are hosted by PUPS. I wrote a small program
that converted the distinct files into a single 'tape'
with a format that simh understands. I could then
proceed with the installation of V7 exactly as the
manual says.

The whole package with instructions is available here:
