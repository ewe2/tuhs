 |I can only speak from my experience, but I think there was a more or less

 |I also believe that the CD contained some music in RedBook form

 |If I am right, then this has been reissued.

You are better off buying the "1979-1983" collection, "Volume One"
and "Volume Two", White and Black they are.

 |Everyone sing along now, Undead undead, undead...

"Paranoia, Paranoia".  But for Plan9 "Stigmata Martyr" would
possibly fit better.  Or "All we ever wanted".  Then again:
"Who killed Mr. Moonlight?"

The German news magazine "DER SPIEGEL" celebrated when they
released a new album after about twenty years, that must have been
13 or so years go, now.

"The Passion of Lovers" is forget says
"God In An Alcove".

Puuuhh....
