Thanks. I saw that already, but the messages are infected with new headers:

   X-Google-Language: ENGLISH,ASCII
   X-Google-Thread: f569d,66bffadc87a4bfc8
   X-Google-Attributes: gidf569d,public
   X-Google-Thread: 11261f,66bffadc87a4bfc8
   X-Deja-AN: 249307211

so I'll work on the UTZoo stuff for now.

Does anybody know if Henry Spencer is still around? Does he know about
this mailing list? It would be nice to have him here.

Cheers, Warren
