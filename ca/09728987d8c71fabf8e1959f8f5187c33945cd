All those terminal quirks made writing termcap entries challenging
(I wrote a few), and made the comments in the termcap file interesting
reading for the frustration and cursing of terminal firmware authors.
All kinds of history of the evolution of terminals is captured therein.

The removal of the ability to read the source is - IMHO - what
greatly impeded adoption of the AT&T "termlib" replacement for
termcap: they stopped distributing the terminal database source
(they distributed just the binary "compiled" versions), and made it
harder to write new entries.
