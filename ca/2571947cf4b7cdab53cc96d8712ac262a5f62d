Minix is probably next on their list for, oh... I dont know... having
concepts remotely in common with 7th edition?

Maybe SCO should do over the Xinu guys too -- just for a laugh.
Oh, and maybe MWC too, just because McBride has obviously had too much
Jolt Cola, or Southern Comfort, or maybe both... mixed in with a lot of
prozac.

But, in answer to their question about "who would you say Unix belongs
to"... I'd have said The Open Group... but it seems that owning the
source code is more important.

Hmm, radical idea here SCO... but, instead of trying to sue everyone
and his goat, why not make UnixWare better than the festering lump it
is now... then you could compete with IBM and Sun etc - oh, and maybe
even fire the troll who thinks that sed is an interactive editor and
wrote so in the UnixWare manual.

P.S. If SCO are of the opinion that IBM have made AIX available under
open source... where can I get the kernel source? ;)
