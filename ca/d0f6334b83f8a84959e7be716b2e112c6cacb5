Here's yet another version of the malloc routines: k_malloc/k_mfree in
http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/informatik/osg/lehre/vorl_BS.SRC/malloc.c
I wonder where these routines were 'borrowed' from? The code appears to be
intermediate between 32V and SVR4, containing assertions and using
mapstart/mapsize, but without spl calls.
