                                 VIRUWORMY
                    (with apologies to Charles Dodgson)

                                  For RTM
                         who made it all possible.


               'Twas eunicks* and the asky chars
                Did grepp and skanneff at the nik:
                All mimdy were the hyperstars,
                And the rad ravs outsmick.

               "Beware the Viruworm, my sun!
                Let not its bits, in temp space get!
                Guard well the Passpass word, and shun
                The durbious Internet!"

                He put his darpal code in ram:
                Long time the decson foe he sought --
                So waited he, in the Dirdir tree
                And slept awhile, swapped out.

                And as with hashish dreams he slept
                The Viruworm -- that spawn from shell --
                Fast fingring through the mayle, it crept
                And gettessed from Koornell!

                Ping, pong! Ping, pong! And long by long
                The darpal code went hicker-hack!
                It ran no more, and with its core
                He went dispiling back.

               "And hast thou killed the Viruworm?
                Nok bless your promms, my sparkish toy!
                O megga win! Ess are eye! Bee bee enn!"
                He broadcast in his joy.

               'Twas eunicks and the asky chars
                Did grepp and skanneff at the nik:
                All mimdy were the hyperstars,
                And the rad ravs outsmick.
