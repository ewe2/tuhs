You can use make as much as you like; Go just doesn't need it. You can use
Go to fetch code from internet if you like, or you can do it yourself if
you prefer.

Regarding the "hardwired" directories, you can change it through an
environment variable.

In the scheme of "current" languages, Go is pretty good.  With two major
caveats, IMO:

1) The build system.  It doesn't work with make(1).  That makes it a
non-starter for anything other than trivial projects at $WORK.  While I
appreciate the arguments for the apparent simplicity of the "go" command,
that doesn't work for us.  Which would have been fine, but for the entirely
antagonistic bent they have taken against being able to build Go programs
with make(1).  Our build environment entirely precludes Go's promiscuous
insistence on unfettered internet access, and hardwired directory paths.

2) Hardwired directory paths for the development/build environment (see
above).

It seems they have unlearned all the UNIX lessons.  Sad, really.  I would
love to toss out Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, et al.  And could make the
argument for it, I think.  But the build environment will never work in our
shop, therefore Go won't either.

And that ... sucks.
