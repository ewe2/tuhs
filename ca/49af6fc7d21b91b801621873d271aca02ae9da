But this isn't *silent* correction.  The shell tells you where
it's putting you when it does this, same as in a 'cd' that
happens via $CDPATH.

Admittedly, you have to be paying attention, but Unix has always
demanded that of its users.

Note that I am not arguing with the idea that silent correction
is bad; I'm merely pointing out that this is not an instance of that.

Thanks,

Arnold
