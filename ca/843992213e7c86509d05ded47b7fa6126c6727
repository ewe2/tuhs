Interesting, in my 4.3BSD experiments recently I have missed
readline.so a lot, but in my implementation I was thinking of building
it into the kernel or the TTY driver (well actually I was thinking of
making it a filter driver, but that's another story). I thought I was
possibly being a bit of a crank (deliberately swimming against the
current to "prove" the current way of doing things is wrong) but this
paper basically suggests the same thing. That's really encouraging.
And, I often find it really annoying that programs like gdb don't have
readline ability.
cheers, Nick
