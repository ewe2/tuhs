Subject: [pups] Strange problems on an uPDP 11/53+
Message-ID: <20010205222446.A3608@mud.stack.nl>

After 52 days, my uPDP 11/53+ has suddenly been acting rather strange.
/usr/include got 'replaced' by /usr/new, to be precise. At the time,
I was the only user. Seeing this, I immediately halted the system,
expecting a load of file system errors upon boot. None showed up, and
/usr/include is back to itself again. However, programs which *used*
to be running perfectly (like my work-in-progress ps) suddenly fail,
with a "not enough memory for saving info".

Any hints?

	How much memory is on the system now after the reboot.   The only
	thing that pops into mind is that the system is running without
	enough memory.    If part of the memory on the system dropped out
	earlier that would (possibly) explain the strange behaviour was
	seen.   Rebooting/reseting the system would cause the system to
	recount memory.

	A program can get 'ENOMEM' as an error two ways: 1) exceeding the
	maximum 64KB dataspace (stack + data) or 2) the system has run out
	of swap or the maps ('coremap' and/or 'swapmap') have become too
	fragmented.

	Two commands that can be useful in obtaining more information are

		sysctl hw

	and 

		pstat -s

	"sysctl hw" will give several lines of output - the two you'd be
	interested in are 

	hw.physmem = 2097152
	hw.usermem = 415744

	'physmem' is the amount of memory physically present and 'usermem' is
	the amount current free and available for user programs.

	"pstat -s" will give a swap space usage summary.

Well, strange things are afoot indeed. About the same time, 1 machine
crashed (A DEC Alpha running OpenBSD), 2 started acting very strangely,
and had to be rebooted (My PDP, and a Wintel box running Windows 2000),
and a 4th machine (A Wintel box running Minix-VMD) suddenly had some
problems reading his harddisk and using its network (but recovered). The
strange thing is that these machines aren't related in any way but one:
they're standing quite near to eachother. Do I hear EMC somewhere?

1.5 MB. 798 Kilowords.

Well, the machine had 1.5 MB before it crashed.. It's doubtlessly some
memory fault, but it *seems* to be a temporal one.

hw.physmem = 1572864

hw.usermem = 313472

Should be enough. 'cc' works without problems - only my ps with debug
info seems to be affected; it might not be a memory issue, but a "ps can't
determine the right amount of processes"-issue.. 

I've checked it, and this seems to be the case. Ps thinks that there are
0 processes running, and does a 
 outargs = (struct psout *)calloc(nproc, sizeof(struct psout));
on that. With 'nproc' being 0, this returns a NULL pointer, but doesn't
mean that the process is out of memory.

Having no ps is very annoying; finding back those 4 children spawned
by a httpd can be a nuisance then. pstat -p works, but it isn't comfortable:)

15/59 swapmap entries
910 kbytes swap used, 6263 kbytes free

	Time to increase the shielding around the computer room, eh? ;-)

	I do not think it is a memory/hardware problem - that was just a
	guess (not a very good one at that ;)).

> hw.usermem = 313472

	That's fine.

> Should be enough. 'cc' works without problems - only my ps with debug

	What about the standard 'ps' that came with the system?

	Ah, ok - malloc() used to actually return a non-NULL pointer when
	presented with a size request of 0.  That was an error and was changed
	(I forget the exact update/patch number).  There were a couple programs
	in the system that relied on the old behaviour and those had to be
	fixed.

	Right, the ENOMEM error was overloaded by malloc().  An argument
	can be made that EINVAL should have been returned instead by malloc()
	if 0 was passed in.

	Are you are using the traditional 'nlist()' method of reading
	the kernel symbol table to look for 'nproc' and '_proc'?  If so
	is there a permissions problem?  /dev/*mem needs to be group=kmem, mode
	640, the /unix image should be mode 644 and the 'ps' program setgid
	to kmem.   If there is a problem reading the kernel symbol table
	then 'nproc' will remain 0 which is what you're seeing.

	Another way of examining some kernel variables (proc table, file table,
	etc) is with the "sysctl" call.  It's much faster since it doesn't
	have to do a sequential scan of the /unix symbol table.   You can
	look in /usr/src/ucb/w.c at the function 'readpr()' to see how to
	examine the proc table using sysctl.
