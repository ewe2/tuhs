Also, be aware that many shippers will not insure international shipments.
If a UPS worker knows that the contents of a particular truck are not
insured, how do you think he/she would treat them?

Someone in the USA surely has an appropriate tape drive.  With the list's
permission, I'd like to ask the members of the classiccmp and SunRescue
lists for help.  To whom should I direct them?
