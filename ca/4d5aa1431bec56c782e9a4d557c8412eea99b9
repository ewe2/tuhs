Subject: [PUPS] Change of PUPS Mail-list software
Message-ID: <200110010616.f916GI591755@minnie.tuhs.org>

All,
	I'm thinking of switching from Majordomo to Mailman for the mailing
lists run on minnie.tuhs.org. I thought I'd try it out on the PUPS mailing
list to start with, because it is so quiet, and also to maybe get some
postings going again.

Mailman has several advantages:
	- list archives are created and have a web interface
	- subscribers can easily change their details
	- list management can also be done via the web.

You can go to http://minnie.tuhs.org/mailman/listinfo/pups
to use the web interface to change your subscription.

If things don't seem to be working, please let me know at my
e-mail address of wkt at tuhs.org

Cheers,
	Warren
