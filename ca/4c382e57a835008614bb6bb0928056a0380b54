Hello from Gregg C Levine
I've been trying to get that notion to work, since it was announced.
Can you post an explanation, regarding how you constructed your 2.11
setup? Was it built from disk dumps, or from one of the previously
built, and stored collections, on the Minnie, file server? Also, a
posting of the startup script would be nice, along with what you are
running this on. That way, we can possibly reproduce your problems for
ourselves. Especially since this is one of my personal projects. And
most importantly of all, what was the date on your simh download?
