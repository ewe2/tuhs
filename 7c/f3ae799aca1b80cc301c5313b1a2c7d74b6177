Again, FWIW, I've successfully - with the expenditure of a good long period of 
time - transferred an 80GB file system from one hard drive to another using 
the GNU cp - I didn't read enough of the man page though, and missed out on 
the -p switch to preserve my ownership on the files - I had to return the 
entire 80 GB to my ownership manually ... ;)  God, I felt like the Prize 
Dork!

But it did the massive job without blinking an eyelid, over the three or so 
hours it took to do it.  It's good stuff.  Just massive itself.
