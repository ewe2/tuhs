​Maybe -- HPC folks use UNIX/Linux but really don't want an OS between the
HW and their application.
And its not just the *.1 style system functions.   Think SPEC1170 where we
discovered 1170 difference interfaces, database file etc... that ISV had to
know about to deal with a 'UNIX' application.​  And that was before we had
things like fabric and messaging.

Within the >>Linux<< (which 'never forked' like UNIX did) the test matrix
is still huge for an ISV these days.
