Cryptic indeed. Actually, it makes some sense. I was logged in as dmr 
and trying to compile the code in a directory where I didn't have 
permissions (apparently I ran tar xv0 as root). So, it seems like the 
compiler succeeded in compiling the code, but wasn't able to create the 
output. I switched to root and was able to get head working.

Thanks,

Will
