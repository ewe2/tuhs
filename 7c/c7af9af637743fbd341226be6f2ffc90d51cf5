Subject: [TUHS] simh vax and 4.3-quasijarus
Message-ID: <20020522180302.7508F40E821@enigma.cybertime.ch>

I installed 4.3-quasijarus on simh, and I managed to boot indirectly
by putting the kernel as /quasijarus0a in the netbsd root filesystem,
and then booting it from the netbsd bootloader with 'boot quasijarus0a
-a'. I have been unable to boot it directly from it's 'own'
filesystem.

here's what I see, complete transcript at the end

that's obviously not what I want. I tried all combinations of
installboot and disklabel -B I can think of, both in netbsd and
quasijarus, and all lead to the same result.

Can anybody tell me the exact incantations necessary to install
the bootblocks for quasijarus0a, or does anybody who has installed
quasijarus0a have a session transcript? any idea what I might be
doing wrong?

So far I have not been able to boot any other VAX operating system
from the TUHS archive, the netbsd bootloader cannot load ultrix32m,
32v and 3bsd. I have not yet had time to try any of the other 4.x
bsds, but I assume they'd have the same problem as quasijarus0a.

I have tried ultrix-4.3 (also from the netbsd bootloader, I don't
have ultrix/vax media to do it right), but it does not work either.

If anybody can help me with this, thanks in advance

The following transcript shows how I boot it (first the way it
fails, then the way it works):

from this point on, it works as expected.


Ultrix 4.3 gives me:
