About 1972 the Department of Computer Science at Strathclyde University =
in Scotland had an operating system implemented on a front-end-processor =
(Icant remember the make)  that allowed the submission and control of =
jobs to a =E2=80=9Cmainframe=E2=80=9D - an ICL 1904s.
The operating system was written in STAB - a language initially designed =
and developed by Professor Andrew Colin - and loosely modelled on BCPL.

My memory is that the FEP was about 12 19=E2=80=9D racks, it supported =
about 15-20 users and did not lose your files terribly often ;-)=
