Tom,

In case you ever pass through Pittsburgh, Dave has 370s of various flavor
and some pdp-11s.  I=E2=80=99d be pretty entertained trying to get this run=
ning in
some capacity on real iron in the future when I visit Dave.

I may put out another form to see if people would be interested in doing an
event there.

In the meantime thanks for recovering and posting this.

Regards,
Kevin
