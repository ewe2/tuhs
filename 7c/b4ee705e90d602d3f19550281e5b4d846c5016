We needn't discuss that (though of course there are opinions and
mine are the correct ones), but in the interest of historic accuracy,
I should point out by 1979 (V7) cat had developed a single option -u
to turn off stdio buffering.

Sometime before 1984 or so, that option was removed, and cat was
simplified to just
	while ((n = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf))) > 0)
		write(1, buf, n)
(error checking elided for clarity)
which worked just fine for the rest of the life of the Research
system.

So it's true that BSD added needless (in my humble but correct
opinion) options, but not that it had none before they touched it.
Unless all those other programs were stuffed into cat in an earlier
Berkeley system, but I don't think they were.
