> I would agree. What other system can you boot on SIMH?

I know 4.3tahoe, netbsd, some ultrix version, and vms boot in it. 
(not to say other ultrix versions dont, but e.g. gunther has booted
ultrix under simh, i have heard many people booting vms, and i have run 
it with images dd'ed from the (running :) / and /usr of one of my 4.3t 
vaxen.) 

What is your configuration?
