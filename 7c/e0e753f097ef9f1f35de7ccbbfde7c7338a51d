I'm interested to see that you've put nsys in as the Fourth Edition,
and that the timestamps are 1973-8-31.  I've had this code on my
machine for years (almost certainly from you), but I thought it was
the Third Edition, and the time stamps are 1973-1-22.  Have you found
reason to change the timestamps and the version?
