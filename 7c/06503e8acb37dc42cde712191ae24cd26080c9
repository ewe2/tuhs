Guys I wrote a more modern version of xstr for a project (porting PDP11
utilities and games to a modern compiler for a different embedded system).
How it worked was similar to i18n utilities on a modern system. (I planned
to internationalize later). So what it did was remove any strings bracketed
with _("blah blah") to a strings file and then replace with a 32-bit
integer offset into the file. I had utilities like _printf(long off, ...)
which would access the strings file to get the necessary string and print
it, or just _strdup() which would bring it into memory where the programmer
could use as normal and free when done. What I did next was to have the
linker treat the strings file as a resource and merge it into the
executable, so that with a little trickery the strings could be directly
accessed from flash ROM while not taking any of the precious 64 kbytes RAM
in the program's data space. Happy to dig this up and share.
