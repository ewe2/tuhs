Yep, that's the one.  I regard it as a bug because it indeed happened in 
user mode...

There was a clever assembly program that did it; it relied upon the 
instruction counter wrapping around (I can't remember in which direction, 
or whether it first relocated itself).  Anyone, it managed to fill memory 
with SPLs, so the next instruction after overwriting its last instruction 
was SPL, and for the foreseeable future after that...

If I find the article I'll post it here; I don't think there are too many 
11/70s still in public operation.

I'll remember that, should I ever see an emulator :-)  I still remember 
Ian Johnstone cursing me...
