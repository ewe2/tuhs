I mostly defer to Heinz and Clem regarding PC/IX. It is hard to imagine 
the IBM people in Boca Raton allowing the Chaplin imagery to be used 
with a secondary product like PC/IX, but I don't remember the packaging.

PC/IX was my first hands on experience with Unix. PC/IX was used 
extensively in the AIX development group while ROMP hardware was scarce.

Before I got my own RT/PC, I used PC/IX primarily, until I got a PC/AT 
and started using some instance of Xenix that supported the 286 MMU.
