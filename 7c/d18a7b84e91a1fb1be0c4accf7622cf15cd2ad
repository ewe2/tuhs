When I was at IBM, I had a few customers running the product I supported
under Linux on z, and what wikipedia says matches my memory of it being
able to run either on metal or as a VM:

   Linux runs on standard, general purpose mainframe CPs (Central
   Processors) as well as IFLs (Integrated Facility for Linux). IFLs are
   mainframe processors dedicated to running Linux, either natively or
   under a hypervisor (z/VM or KVM on z). Microcode restricts IFLs from
   running "traditional" workloads, such as z/OS, but they are physically
   identical to other z System processors. IFLs are typically less
   expensive to acquire from IBM than CPs.
