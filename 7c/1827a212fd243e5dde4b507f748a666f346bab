Subject: [TUHS] Unix clones
Message-ID: <1491441504.58e5976086fec@www.paradise.net.nz>

The mention of UNOS a realtime "clone" of Unix in a recent thread raises a question for me. How many 
Unix clones are there?

(My interest in Unix was the result of a local computer magazine, Bits'n'Bytes in the late 80s and early 90s 
discussing two clones, Minix and Coherent in its Unix column. Then came Linux ...)

We've got a timeline (in several forms, in the 4.3BSD and 4.4BSD books and The Magic Garden, on Groklaw, 
and elsewhere) for Unix and its developments; has anyone done one for the clones?

Thanks

Wesley Parish
