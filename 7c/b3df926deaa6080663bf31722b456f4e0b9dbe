Are dmr and bwk and ken on this list?  Be fun to include them.  If we
want to have a bay area gathering I'll happily offer up my place, we have
an annual pig roast here that is somewhat well attended by local geeks
(ZFS guys, Linus, Dave Miller, some Bell Labs folks like Greg Chesson
and Bart Locanthi the guy that did the BLIT with Rob Pike - still my
favorite terminal).  I'm probably forgetting somebody who will be pissed
so sue me.  But we gather a good crowd of geeks.
