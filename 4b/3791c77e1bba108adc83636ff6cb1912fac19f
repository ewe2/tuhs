Of course.  I'm just saying that it's possible to set up mailing lists
so that even people who use modern techniques for securing email can use
them with no problems.  Seems to me, then, that the best response to the
"problem" is to set the list up right.  And that the pressure should
perhaps be on mailing list maintainers to do this, rather than on users
to get their email providers and employers to not use SPF/DKIM/DMARC.
