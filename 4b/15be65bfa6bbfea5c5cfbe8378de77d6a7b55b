This is an amazing story; thanks for sharing, Ken.

There is an interesting film about project ECHO on youtube:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY8MeZ6lpwI

While it doesn't mention Joe Ossanna directly, there is a small part in the
film where the satellite is located after being launched. Given your story,
one might reasonably assume that that part of the narrative refers
to Ossanna's program, albeit indirectly.

Btw: I've heard that interference detected through the horn antenna at the
Holmdel site lead was explained by cosmic background radiation that was
attributed to the Big Bang; this apparently provided critical observational
evidence that led to the acceptance of the Big Bang theory.
