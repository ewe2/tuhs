Subject: [pups] Supnik Emulator on Redhat Linux
Message-ID: <000901c64c4f$ae9a4130$0202a8c0@robinslaptop>

Hi,

I have successfully got the supnik emulator up and running on redhat but
have hit a problem, which is probably configuration and serves to show how
little I know about more recent unices.

 

To allow computer to emulator comms I have installed a second card and
enabled it under linux.  It is enabled with a different address to the first
one 192.168.1.10 and 192.168.1.11.  The emulator can see both of the devices
and I have attached device 1 (eth1) as xq0.

 

I run up BSD2.11 on the emulator and it attaches to the ether device at
start up.  

 

I can ftp from the emulator to the host and back again if I start ftp on the
emulator.

 

I can't telnet to the host.

 

I can't telnet from the host to the emulator.

 

I can't ftp from the host to the emulator.

 

I also can't telnet in from a telnet session to the listening socket set up
for a DZ11 (I could before I started trying to get the networking up).

 

Ideas anyone?

 

Robin
