I think the unix archive has SysIII for the PDP-11. (or is this unix 
trees page not actually part of the unix archive? since i can't see the 
corresponding tar)

http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=SysIII

I don't know what license it's made public under, since the Caldera 
License specifically excludes SysIII
