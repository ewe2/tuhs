Yes but what I was suggesting was that this may have been a case of too
eagerly standardizing a new feature that one implementation had added
without considering whether there was a good reason to impose that
feature on other implementations.

I mean, surely not *everything* that SVr4 does is in POSIX. There must
therefore be some rationale for selecting which features, particularly
features that are not already universal, to standardize. So what was the
rationale for including this one?
