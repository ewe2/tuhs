Sure, Open WatCom, offers (if I remember well) C, C++ and fortran compilers
for DOS (among others) derived from traditional WatCom compilers (see
www.openwatcom.com).

As for databases... you may be interested in looking over other links. Your
initial query was too narrow (public domain << open source). See e.g.

	http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~scg/Archive/Software/FreeDB/FreeDB.list.html
	http://www.swen.uwaterloo.ca/~mrbannon/cs798/

or search for 'open source dbms' or 'open source database'.
