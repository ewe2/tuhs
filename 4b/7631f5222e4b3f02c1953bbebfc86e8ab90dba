> Once SCCS was heavily used, was there a codebase that housed all of these distributions?

No. The Research Unix team was small, had no responsibility to
support old versions, and eschewed paperwork. But we were
conscientiouws about maintaining the manual and fixing bugs.
Close personal contact kept things on track; SCCS was never
used. Because of frequent exchanges of software, there
may be hints of Research activity in PWB SCCS records.
