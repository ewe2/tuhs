  For
  example, last year Caldera released "ancient UNIX" under a BSD-style
  license, but now they're claiming it never happened.  Maybe they don't
  know about the company history.  And if the code in dispute is derived
  from ancient UNIX, there'll be egg on their face.

If the code in dispute is derived from an ancient UNIX covered by
the Jan 2002 free license, and it doesn't clearly say so somewhere,
there is certainly egg and chips on someone's face.  Said license
imposes few conditions, but one is that Caldera's copyright must
be maintained and the notice `This product includes software developed
or owned by Caldera International, Inc.' placed in `any advertising
materials.'

Of course, if the code comes from V6 and those notices are present
and Caldera still claims it's stolen, that's another basket of eggs.
