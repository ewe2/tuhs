"A UNIX System Implementation for System/370" (by W. A. Felton, G. L. Miller,
and J. M. Milner):

  https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/otherports/ibm.html

says "code to support System/370 I/O, paging, error recording and recovery,
and multiprocessing already existed in several available operating systems,
we investigated the possibility of using an existing operating system, or at
least the machine-interface parts of one, as a base to provide these
functions for the System/370 implementation ... Of the available systems,
TSS/370 came the closest to meeting our needs and was thus chosen as the base
for our UNIX system implementation". Alas, it doesn't say which other systems
were also considered.

That paper says: "We initially thought about porting the UNIX operating
system directly to System/370 with minimal changes. Unfortunately, there are
a number of System/370 characteristics that, in the light of our objectives
and resources, made such a direct port unattractive. The Input/Output (I/O)
architecture of System/370 is rather complex; in a large configuration, the
operating system must deal with a bewildering number of channels,
controllers, and devices, many of which may be interconnected through
multiple paths. Recovery from hardware errors is both complex and
model-dependent. For hardware diagnosis and tracking, customer engineers
expect the operating system to provide error logs in a specific format;
software to support this logging and reporting would have to be written. ...
Finally, several models of System/370 machines provide multiprocessing, with
two (or more) processors operating with shared memory; the UNIX system did
not support multiprocessing."

Presumably these factors outweighed the factors listed in the
Haley/London/Maranzaro/Ritchie letter.
