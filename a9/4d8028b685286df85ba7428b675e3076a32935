You know what's amazing? that Bill Joy code to launch either
csh or bourne shell based on the first character of teh file is
still in tcsh codebase today. It even has #! support just in case
your kernel does not. However this code never gets run as
who write scripts without #! anymore .. but here's a little test ---

$ tcsh
You have 2 mail messages.
> cat x1.sh
PATH=/bin
echo $SHELL
> ./x1.sh
/bin/sh
> cat x2.csh
#
setenv path /bin
echo $shell
> ./x2.csh
/usr/local/bin/tcsh
> exit

you can see it in https://github.com/tcsh-org/tcsh/blob/master/sh.exec.c
