UNIX is just better than just about anything when you have real work to 
get done.

For example, we have a popular web log analyzer program ( that shall 
remain nameless ), that apparently is not very capable, because they 
frequently ask me to make custom reports.  Naturally I use the UNIX 
tools available to that I know how to use ... And so I keep threatening 
to just re-write that application in AWK.
