If you could find a relase notification, or any docs on this releas
that'd be cool...

As for the lore of UWisc & SunOS... I've never heard any of that
before, so it's all interesting to me!
All I vaugely know about SunOS is that it picked up when Bill Joy
joined SUN, it involved the 68000 cpu stuff
prior to the whole SPARC thing..   I've seen that TME thing and seen
someone get SunOS running under it.. It seemed
pretty neat, but I've always personally wondered about the fesability
of somehow emulating a SUN-1.. Eventhough SunOS 0.7
was just a v7 port by Unisoft (so says wikipedia).. which I highly
doubt would be open for redistribution..

As for the source to SunOS I had heard in college it was open to
educational stuff, but my crappy school wasn't interested in asking as
it would seem like "work"..  Heh, I've always wondered if there were
ports of SunOS to the vax or something un sunlike...

I guess that is the fate of most unix'y stuff...
