I have no SPARE address. And this thing entirely should be avoided there 
for 2 reasons
1. This is colocated host, ISP has a policy on no MAC address/IP address 
tweaking. Non-standard services are too expensive and should be avoided at

2. This is not dedicated box, hosting email services and www. Not loaded, 
but critical in sence, that services should work.
