Oh my.

I mean, I know that OS (and descendants--for those of you without this =
particular trauma, we mostly mean MVS (now z/OS), but of course there's =
OS/MFT, OS/MVT, and then OS/MVS)  was always trying to kill VM, and we =
went through similar crap with Linux/390 (and zLinux), which contains =
code to let it run directly on the iron, even though even production =
shops are not going to *do* that (OpenSolaris-for-z required VM =
underneath it; hell, it required a couple new DIAGs we requested).

That actually makes it easy to run zLinux on Hercules, so I'm not =
complaining, but...it's not how any shop running it as anything other =
than a curiosity would do it.  I mean, OK, I guess you could have a =
teeny little LPAR but let's face it the LPAR is basically VM.

But TSS was always *also* an also-ran (that is, not OS).  It's really =
weird (to me, anyway) to see it was hostile to VM too.
