A good example.  But you're not removing options, you're just
redefining them.  In fact I find the -h option particularly emetic, so
a better choice in removing options would be to remove -h and use a
filter to mutilate the sizes:

  $ ls -l | humanize

But that's a pain, isn't it?  That's why there's a -h option for
people who like it.  Note that you can't do it the other way round:
you can't get the exact size from -h output.

And then there's the question why you don't like the standard output.
Because the number strings are too long and difficult to read, maybe?
That's the rationale for the -, option.

This is arguably a bug in the -B option.  I certainly don't think the
pipe notation is quicker.  But it's nice to have both alternatives.
