Subject: [TUHS] Unix, eunuchs?
Message-ID: <874pz21gwa.fsf@stella.c0t0d0s0.de>

Hi,

last week a work mate told us a tale about how Unix came to its
name. He believes that Unix is named after the term eunuch (a
homophone of (to?) unix in english language). One can see Unix as a
castrated successor of Multics. Hmmm, I am interested in Unix history
for several years now, but I haven't heard about that before. It is
really a tale I guess. Any clear words about this topic?

Michael
