Looks like Simh unpacks with lots of ^Ms. Tim has updated the patch.
I've updated the Readme:

1. Download the source code for the Simh simulator from here:
   http://simh.trailing-edge.com/. Unpack it somewhere.

2. Copy misc/pdp11_ke.c into the Simh PDP11/ directory, and apply
   the misc/KE.diff patch to the source code:

        patch -l < misc/KE.diff

3. In Simh, make the BIN/ directory. Do make pdp11 to make the pdp11 simulator.
   Copy the BIN/pdp11 executable into the tools/ directory.
