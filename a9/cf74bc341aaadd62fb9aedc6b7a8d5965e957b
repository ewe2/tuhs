I've just tried to list a FreeBSD 7.2 dump on NetBSD 5.0.1:

  Extract directories from tape
  Mangled directory: reclen less than DIRSIZ (12 < 16)
  (many repetitions)
  Mangled directory: reclen less than DIRSIZ (12 < 16)
  . is not on the tape
  Root directory is not on tape
  abort? [yn] y

Interestingly, FreeBSD restore can understand the NetBSD dump.  But
it's not even backwards compatible between major releases of FreeBSD
even, so this might be the same issue as with FreeBSD.  Either way, I
don't think it's a good idea to count on it for NetBSD in the future.
