Hello Cornelius,

Appears it is indeed, taken from the archive:

info on tcpip.gtz
Author: various
Date: June 7, 1994
Copyright: freely distribatable for non-commercial purposes.
Uploaded by: Randy Wright, (rw at rwsys.wimsey.bc.ca)
Description:
Adapted from KA9Q/K5JB, this is a user level implementation of
tcp/ip. It has been modified to support 32 bit coding, event
drive, and stripped of all that I could not test. It does
not support ax.25 or netrom. It does support ethernet (with
ne2000.gtz device driver) and slip. It has a dialer and a
domain name client. Compiles with either gcc OR mwc compiler.

requires: coherent 4.2 or higher.

A quick google reveals
http://www1.vobis.de/bbs/firmen/ct/share/index_ch.htm to be a source
for download (search for cohulip.tar).

The box I have it on is a 486sx/25 with 8Mb RAM - remembering the joys
of X11R6 + fvwm back when it ran Linux 2.0.29, I'm tempted to install
X11 on it now :)
