I’ve always said that the person was a ‘reformed’ axe-wielding murderer
who knows where you live.

Please, a little decorum.

W.R.T. comments in code, and a bit of Unix, when I taught Unix Systems
programming at UCSD one of my students wanted to use his personal
computer for the programming. I didn’t care as long as it would pass the
tests I ran after the fact.

After his second homework was turned in, I stopped looking at his code
or even running it, as the comment blocks were just so well done. Nary
a comment in the function itself, just a block before each one very clearly
explaining what was happening.
