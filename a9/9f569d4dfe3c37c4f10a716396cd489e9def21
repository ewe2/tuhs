I detested the CSH syntax.   In order to beat back the CSH proponents at BRL, I added JOB control to the SV  (and later SVR2) Bourne Shell.   Then they beat on me for not having command like editing in (a la TCSH), so I added that.   This shell went out as /bin/sh in the Doug Gwyn SV-on-BSD release so every once and a while over the years I trip across a “Ron shell” usually people who were running Mach-derived things that ran my shell as /bin/sh.
