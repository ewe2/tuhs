I knew Mike, interesting dude.  His "The Elements of Networking Style" is
a very fun read but also, for me, just getting to understand networking,
it snapped a bunch of stuff into focus.  I think you have to read it
at just the right spot in your career and I did.  Great little book and
full of jabs like "If you know what you are doing, 3 layers are enough.
If you don't, 7 aren't."
