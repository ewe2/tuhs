 |I have this one on the waqll in the office:
 |https://xkcd.com/1597/

I for one am so happy to have git that i cannot tell you how much
that is.  I have used rcs, cvs, subversion, back to cvs,
mercurial over the years,, and for some small things also sccs.
All of it has been a pain here or there.  Yes, the weave.  Schily
wants to provide real changeset support for sccs (tagging is real
problem), i think.  No, stashing, simply commiting something
half-ready, amending, rebasing, and, very important, proper
garbage collection of thrown away or otherwise useless stuff,
i will never miss again.

The only bad aspects is the lack of an automatically expanded,
human readable version number that can be included in files, and
that you cannot simply checkout, say, one directory, but only the
entire repository.  Its capability to work with shallow
repositories has improved over the years, however.  Nonetheless,
i claim that for the maintainer of one or two ports/packages it is
much nicer to use cvs, and only check out what really is of
interest to you; than to checkout thousands of things that is.

A nice weekend from Germany i wish,
