I am also surprised to hear that ptrace replaces procfs.  In the 4.4BSD
Book[1] is a chapter about process debugging (chapter 4) with ptrace and
it says:

``The ptrace facility is inefficient for three reasons.  [...]''

And later, it mentions the proc filesystem: 

``To address these problems, 4.4BSD added a /proc filesystem, similar to
the one found in UNIX Eight Edition [Killian, 1984]. [...]''
