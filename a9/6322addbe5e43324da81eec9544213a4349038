It seems this guy doesn't understand statistics. He checked his 2 pools
and is confident that a sample of 4 disks (likely) he knows that URE
specs are crap. Even from an economic PoV it doen't make sense.
Why wouldn't the disk companies tout an even lower error rate if they
can get away with it? Presumably these rates are derived from reading
many many disks and averaged.

Here's what the author says on a serverfault thread:
https://serverfault.com/questions/812891/what-is-exactly-an-ure

  @DavidBala=C5=BEic Evidently, your sample size of one invalidates the
  entirety of probability theory! I suggest you submit a paper to
  the Nobel Committee. =E2=80=93 Ian Kemp Apr 16 '19 at 5:37

  @IanKemp If someone claims that all numbers are divisible by 7 and
  I find ONE that is not, then yes, a single find can invalidate an
  entire theory. BTW, still not a single person has confirmed the myth
  in practice (by experiment), did they? Why should they, when belief
  is more than knowledge...=E2=80=93 David Bala=C5=BEic Apr 16 '19 at =

Incidentally, it is hard to believe he scrubs his 2x64TB pools once a =
month.
Assuming 250MB/s sequential throughput and his scrubber can stream it at
that rate, it will take him close to 6 days (3 days if reading them in
parallel) to read every block. During this time these pools won't be
useful for anything else. Unclear if he is using any RAID or a =
filesystem
that does checksums. Without that he would be unable to detect hidden
data corruption.

In contrast, ZFS will only scrub *live* data. As more of the disks are=20=

filled up, scrub will take progressively more time. Similarly,
replacing a zfs mirror won't read the source disk in its entirety,
only the live data.

That is not how URE specs are derived.

Indeed :-)=
