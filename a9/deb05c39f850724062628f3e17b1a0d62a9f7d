In TOPS-10, you could detach from your current job, login again, and 
keep going. Then, attach to the previous job, and go back and forth 
endlessly.

As for keeping memory around, it was very common on TOPS-10 to put code 
in a "hiseg" that would stick around, and was shareable between "jobs".

For something like EMACS, it would be very efficient to have the first 
person run it "compile" all the LISP, leave it in the hiseg, and other 
jobs can then run that code.

Not knowing anything about EMACS, I'm not sure that compiled code was 
actually shareable if it was customized, just thinking out loud.

But even without leveraging the hiseg capability, it was relatively easy 
to save an entire core image back to a .SAV or .LOW or later a .EXE. I 
don't remember how easy it was to do that programmatically, but it was 
easy from the terminal and if it saves a lot of processor time (and 
elapsed time) people would have been happy to do it manually.
