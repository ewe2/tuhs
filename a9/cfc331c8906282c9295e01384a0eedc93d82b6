Abermud on a L-66?  That certainly sounds interesting!

I bought efylon.org a few years ago to keep the abermud list alive.  I had setup a 4.2BSD SIMH VAX that replaced the login program with the AberMUD 2 that I had found on http://abermud.tripod.com/mudstuff.html .

Although I’m sure running it will be some fun....

Yes!  I am very much interesting in getting my eyes on that early B
version of AberMUD (and any other B code for that matter.)

It's a few inches thick, I'll dig it out and post sample code photos from it, somewhere.
