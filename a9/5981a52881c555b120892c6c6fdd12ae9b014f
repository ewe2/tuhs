I remember the Masscomps we had fondly.  The ones we had were 68000 based
and they had two of those CPUs running in lock step (or something, Clem
will correct this, he was one of the main devs at Masscomp) because the
68K didn't do VM right.  I can't remember the details, it was something
like they didn't handle faults right so they ran two CPUs and when the 
fault happened the 2nd CPU somehow got involved.

Clem, what model was that?  And can you provide the real version of what
I was trying say?
