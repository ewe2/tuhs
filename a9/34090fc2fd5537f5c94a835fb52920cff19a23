	I have an extremely vague memory I might have seen it eons upon 
	eons ago but I might be imaginging it.

	Hmmm, '?' is "ed"s error indication.   I wonder if the '?' is
	coming out of ed and not SIMH?

	Not at this stage of the build - a config file error wouldn't allow
	the first few compiles to succeed and then start causing errors
	on kern_clock.c

	One thing I did notice though was the use of 'ed' - that tells me
	the patchlevel of the system is very low (i.e. old).   'ed' was
	replaced with 'sed' which sped things up a _lot_ - and that took
	place back around #325 in 1996.

	Have you tried P11 instead of SIMH?  When I'm too lazy to fire up
	the 11/73 I use P11 to do the testing/patching and so on.   It's a
	bit a pain to configure (really arcane configfile syntax) but it works
	very well - never had a problem with it.

	Good Luck.
