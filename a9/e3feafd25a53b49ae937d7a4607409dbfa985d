Subject: [TUHS] Location of a Coherent distribution?
Message-ID: <20040204014540.GB85382@minnie.tuhs.org>

Hi all,
	Does anybody know of a distribution of Mark William's Coherent
available on-line, or if someone has a distribution could they make a
copy for me. Ditto for Idris. I'm particularly interested in their
header files, and how closely they match the contemporary Unix headers.

Thanks,
	Warren
