I do so quibble.  In particular I quibble that features *that were not present in Algol*, such as full continuations (which I think exist in the AIM-349 language via CATCH) can have 'come from Algol'.  Full continuations are the place where Scheme actually takes lexical scope seriously.

But I'm not interested in getting into a fight about this.

(I think, in terms of modern Scheme, CATCH is:

(define-syntax catch
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((_ tag form ...)
     (call/cc (Î» (tag) form ...)))))

although I might be wrong)
