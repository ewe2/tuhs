Look in:

  http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=2.11BSD/sys/pdp/scb.s

which maps from trap vector locations (built into the hardware; consult a
PDP-11 CPU manual for details) to trap type numbers, which are defined here:

  http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=2.11BSD/sys/pdp/trap.h

and handled here:

  http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=2.11BSD/sys/pdp/trap.c


    > and cpuerrs?

That just prints the contents of the CPU Error Register; see an appropriate
PDP-11 CPU manual - 11/70, /44, /73, /83 or /84 for what all the bits mean.
Also the "KDJ11-A CPU Module User's Guide", which also documents it.

In theory, there's also a KDJ11-B UG, but it's not online. If anyone has one,
can we please get it scanned? Thanks!
