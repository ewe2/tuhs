Subject: [TUHS] mini-unix distribution tape recovered
Message-ID: <46F446AE.4040102@bitsavers.org>

I beleive I have sucessfully read a Dec, 1979 mini-unix
distribution tape yesterday evening. I've placed it for
the next week or so under http://bitsavers.org/miniunix

It is in .tap format, which should work with SIMH.

It is a single large file blocked 512 bytes/record
