Yeah. I work on Illumos now for Oxide, and it's...fine? But it took a long
time to get there.

When the SunOS->Solaris changeover happened, the thing that really tripped
me up was `awk`. SunOS 4's awk was nawk, but Solaris 2's awk was 7th Ed awk
and lacked functions and so forth. nawk was available as `nawk`, but it
seemed like a gratuitous regression and we had to modify a lot of local
shell scripts and so on.

I've been dealing with a couple of Linux machines over the break, and
trying to do things the canonical way instead of running back to the
familiar tools, but some things just aren't supported. `ss` doesn't know
about some of the more exotic address families, like AX.25 and NET/ROM. I
can certainly understand why (talk about a hobbyist niche...) but the irony
is that I had to install `netstat` anyway.
