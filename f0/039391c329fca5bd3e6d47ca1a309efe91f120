Would it make sense to add Sprite to the Unix Archives? To me, yes, it was
enough UNIX like although it wasn't ATT or BSD derived and it had many
advanced features.

I had the (small) pleasure to run it on a small number of DECstations back in
1994-1995 out of the freshly published WalnuCreek CD and I still long for some
of it features.

The distribution is still available at
