My point is that this is something that varies from distro to distro;
it is therefore inaccurate to claim that "Linux solved it" since many
different distros that have widely varying installation processes
fall under the very large "Linux" umbrella.

That's an interesting angle and one that I think bears more on the topic
at hand than many folks are willing to let on: the barrier to contribution is,
in a lot of important ways, lower in the Linux ecosystem than it is in the
BSD world. At least historically speaking, and perhaps still true. Anecdotally,
I was able to get a patch into the KVM unit tests (not precisely Linux but
related) in pretty short order recently while the OpenBSD people simply
ignored my problem report and patch. YMMV.

Eh? I feel like I can upgrade the kernel on the various BSDs
without binaries breaking pretty easily. Then again, there _have_
been times when there were flag days that required rebuilding
the world; but surely externalities are more common here (e.g.,
switching from one ISA to another).

This, I think, is where things break down. Simply put, the way
people build applications has changed, and "source-level"
compatibility means compatibility with a bunch of third-party
libraries; in many ways the kernel interfaces matter much, much
less (many of which are defined by externally imposed standards
anyway). If a distro ships a too-old or too-new version of the
dependency, then the open source thing will often not build, and
for most end users, this is a distinction without a difference.

Yup. But then that you're running Linux is mostly immaterial; it could
be Windows and the same would be true.
