I'll try and remember, but this was about 40 years ago...

Not a chance; about all it had were the system calls.  Portable I/O came 
with either Edition 6 or PWB, then Standard I/O replaced it.  I could be 
wrong, of course...  Ed5 may have had getc()/putc() - I dunno.

Hmmm...  I must have a peek at them, and for laughs port the v7 one to 
BSD/Linux/Mac.

Well, complete for the day...  Memory limits were basically 64kw for each 
space (I'm not even sure whether Ed5 had sep/id space).  The irony of the 
PDP-11 was that it could support virtual memory in theory, but simply 
didn't have enough address registers.  Or am I thinking of some other box?

Gawd; I'd love to see APL again!  I used it on the IBM-360.

Very little; Ed5 was the first public release, so unless an old-timer has 
them squirreled away somewhere...
