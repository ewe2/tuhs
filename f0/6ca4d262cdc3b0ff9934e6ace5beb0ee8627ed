Well it depends on what you think that the "rule" is ...

If you think that the "rule" is "no ISR can touch user space while
interrupting a kernel process", then it is display() that breaks
the rule.

If, however, the rule is "the user PAR and PDR registers will at
all times reflect the address space mapping of the current user
process" then it is _copyseg and _clearseg that "break" the rule
by "borrowing" some of the user PARs and PDRs, and in that case
it seems appropriate that they should raise the spl level so that
nobody else will be "surprised" by seeing those registers in an
apparently inconsistent state.
