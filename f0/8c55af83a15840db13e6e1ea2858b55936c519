​Pretty much, the idea was that if you have 4.3tahoe or reno system
somewhere, it could build 4.4lite assuming you supplied the few missing
files (which were generally available/findable/reasonably easy to intuit.​

​Exactly....​  And *lite* would fork off the Academic oriented NetBSD
releases with the academic community doing the support for each system.

​Sounds right... I thought the encumbered bits worked on CCI, Vaxen (and
possibly SUN1s with the *10 upgrade boards), although might not have been
tested as thoroughly as earlier CSRG releases.


​The 386 bits were the sources of a great deal of issue between CSRG and
Jolitiz.  I was friends with all of the protagonists in that drama so I'm
going to try to be careful what I say here.

There was an 'encumbered' 386 distribution on the ftp site for a long time
although installation was definitely experts only (as I said, I helped with
the original disk support if you read the DDJ articles).  And the spurce of
my previous comments on this mailing list that if you knew about it, you
could get it

These bits are basically the pre-FreeBSD starting point.  FWIW: back in the
day, I had it the running on a Wyse 32:16 for a number of years, and might
still have a backup of it on 1/4" QIC tape; but the HW started to get flaky
and FreeBSD superseded it on other HW and it was not supported.​ I had kept
the boot image around as a reference for a book I was working on at the
time; but eventually just switched to using FreeBSD as the 4.4 'definition'
as it was good enough for what we were doing then.
