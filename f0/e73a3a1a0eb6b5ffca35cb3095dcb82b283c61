I=E2=80=99ve also done a port of the BBN VAX stack to V6 (running on a =

I=E2=80=99d love to have a look at that and compare and contrast the =
approaches.

I=E2=80=99m finding that BBN=E2=80=99s original design, with a separate =
kernel thread for the network stack,
is elegant but difficult to tune: too much priority and it crowds out =
user processes, too little
and the slow PPP line is not kept busy.

I think I=E2=80=99m beginning to understand why CSRG (and later also =
BBN) moved to
the interrupt driven structure of 4.2BSD: perhaps it was also difficult =
to tune for a
VAX with ethernet.
