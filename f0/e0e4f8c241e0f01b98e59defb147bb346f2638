Hi.

EFL was definitely a part of BSD Unix.  But I don't see it in the V7
stuff in the TUHS archives.  When did it first appear?  Was it part
of 32V and I should look there?

It is definitely in the V8 and V10 stuff.

Did anyone actually use it?  I have the feeling that ratfor had already
caught on and spread far, and that it met people's needs, and so
EFL didn't really catch on that much, even though it provided more
features on top of Fortran.

Thanks,

Arnold
