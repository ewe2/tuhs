I=E2=80=99m making a little progress with early Datakit & Unix.

It would seem that there were various experimental protocols before URP =
was arrived upon.

The first protocol appears to have been designed by Chesson in 1979. One =
Fraser paper says: ""The first Datakit protocols used a packet structure =
that was aligned with cell boundaries. Chesson designed a file transfer =
protocol that transported data in variable length packets, each ending =
with a trailer.=E2=80=9D I think this protocol is being described in his =
paper "Datakit Software Architecture=E2=80=9D (vol. 2, pp. 20.2.1-20.2.5 =
Proceedings of the IEEE Int. Conf. on Communications, June 1979, Boston) =
- which unfortunately does not seem to be available in the IEEE online =
library. Maybe it will surface some day.

Next there was a protocol tied to a Datakit terminal interface board =
that used an 8-slot packet sequence/acknowledge mechanism that carried =
over into URP. Not much appears to have been published about this.

The most interesting experiment seems to have been a project by Luderer, =
Che and Marshall to build a Datakit-based distributed Unix in 1980/81. =
Marshall is credited by Fraser as one of the inventors of the URP =
protocol. The papers are =E2=80=9CA virtual switch as the basis for =
distributed systems=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CA distributed unix system =
based on a virtual circuit switch=E2=80=9D (available online from the =
ACM library).

The first has a good overview description of how early Datakit worked =
(including interface hardware) and describes the Network Kernel or =E2=80=9C=
NK protocol=E2=80=9D. It would seem that URP combines the flow & =
retransmission control from the terminal interface board with the =
concept of a single simple receiver algorithm from NK. Unfortunately the =
paper does not describe the design of the NK transmitter algorithm(s). =
It confirms that everything ran on V7, but it remains unclear how the =
Datakit channels were exposed to the user (I currently assume as a =
cluster of character devices, with the major number identifying the =
switch connection and the minor number identifying the channel - similar =
to what later would be used in V8).

The second has a description of a modified Unix system, where clients =
(=E2=80=9CS-Unix=E2=80=9D) talk to file servers (=E2=80=9CF-Unix=E2=80=9D)=
, with the file servers mounted into the local file tree of the client. =
This appears to predate the work of Weinberger for the V8 network file =
system and its implementation appears different.

Questions:

- Are Luderer, Che and Marshall still around? (especially Bill Marshall =
might still recall some more details of the genesis of the URP protocol)

- Any recollections about S/F-Unix and how it did or did not influence =
V8-V10/Plan9?=
