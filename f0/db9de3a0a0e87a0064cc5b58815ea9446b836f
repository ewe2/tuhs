I now see our disconnect Noel.   Yes the V6 kernel runs in split I and D mode, but it doesnâ€™t end up supporting any more data.   I.e. the kernel is still a 407 (or 410) file.   _etext/_edata/_end are still referencing the same 64K space.   What we did (among others) was to allow the system to boot up from a split I/D image that could be a full 65K of text and a substantial additional amount of initialized data (and bss).
