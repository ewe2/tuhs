I still have the grope source. It starts with

/**************************************************
 * GROPE - spelling correction - Bill Taylor - Dept 43231
 *
 * The information contained herein is for the use of BELL LABORATORIES
 * and is not for publication.  (See GEI 13.9-3)
 ***************************************************/

but I have been told by people I trust that the algorithm is really due to
Tom Szymanski. I have used the algorithm for matching city and street names
from the US Postal Service, and it did very well, quite a bit better than
the Levenshtein algorithm, for that application. It worked well for
"ordinary" dictionary matching, but would have been ghastly for things like
approximate matching of DNA base pairs.

Don't get me started about automating directory lookup. That was my first
BTL project in the Business Information System division in the early 70s.
It was obviously superior to paper records, and we had no trouble pitching
up the corporate ladder until we got to the executive director level. In a
blaze of insight, he asserted that microfilm had stolen the market,
whereupon our director executed a light-speed 180 about supporting the
project, and it died. The executive director later became Vice President of
Electronic Information Systems at Western Electric.
