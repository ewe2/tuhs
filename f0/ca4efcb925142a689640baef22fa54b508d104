What?!?!  I put networking in some version of SCO, it most certainly 
did have pipes.  Maybe they were faked in the shell but I tend to think
I would have noticed that, I did all sorts of pipelines on that project.

So are you _sure_ the kernel doesn't implement pipes?  SCO would have 
to have taken them out, v7 has usr/sys/sys/pipe.c
