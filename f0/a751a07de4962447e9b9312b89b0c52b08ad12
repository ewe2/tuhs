This is straying way off topic, but I thought it would be interesting to =
look at a couple of older sources about it, say, from the late 1940s =
when there were computers with programs.

A search on Google Books in the date range 1800-1950 gives a lot of hits =
(at least 10 screens worth). Since it=E2=80=99s Google, your results may =
vary, but here are the first few I got:

- US Congress hearings on National Health Program, 1946: "Any discussion =
on either the main program or the amendment to=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D Fair =
enough. Got the phrase, it=E2=80=99s in the range. Just not relevant to =
the current investigation.

- C Programming: Test Your Skills by Ashok Kamthane, dated by Google =
Books to 1900

- Information Circular, dated 1925, with the excerpt starting =E2=80=9CIt =
consists of a main program, two subroutine subprograms, A macro-flow =
chart of the program is shown on figure A-1=E2=80=9D. Which seems odd, =
because that pretty clearly isn=E2=80=99t really from 1925. So I clicked =
through the document, which turns out to be Information Circular 1601: =
Corrosion Resistance of Metals in Hot Brines: A Literature Review=E2=80=9D=
 published by the US Bureau of Mines in 1973.
It also does not have the excerpt in the document.

- Programming Techniques Through C: A Beginners Companion by M. G. =
Venkateshmurthy, dated 1900.

- Technical Bulletin, Issues 206-216, dated 1922 with the excerpt "The =
main program (MAIN) will be discussed first and then each of the =
subroutines called by the main program. Sometimes the subroutines called =
by the main program call other subroutines.=E2=80=9D. Clicking through =
to it gives the response =E2=80=9CNo results in this book for =E2=80=98mai=
n program=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D. This turns out to be incorrect, because =
somewhere between the Google Books server and my Safari browser the =
search string was mishandled. Changing it in the search box gives 3 =
snippets referencing =E2=80=9Cmain program=E2=80=9D, and the document is =
apparently about a FORTRAN program compiled with the CDC6400 FTN version =
3 compiler. However, nothing more than the snippets is available and the =
1922 date is obviously wrong.

Remaining items on the first page are similarly clearly misdated or =
about non-computer main programs.

No one said archival research is easy, but Google Books does present =
itself as having better data than it delivers.
