I would be happy if we had a commonly accepted OSS line for OpenSolaris 
development.

The current problem is that the payers in that game all have commercial 
interests and removed many parts from the sources that they believe are not 
needed anymore.

Another problem is that the closed source i18n parts of libc in Illumos have 
been replaced by a FreeBSD implementation version that is not POSIX compliant.

So for today, there is development but only in order to meet particular 
interests.
