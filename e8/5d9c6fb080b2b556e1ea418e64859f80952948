I had the great pleasure of learning on an NIS/NetInfo/Active Directory. =
I=E2=80=99m not sure what the windows service was called but we would =
edit all our clients to point to a sun solaris 6-8 NIS server.

Sun bought some LDAP company with planet in the name and I never in =
months of trying could get their LDAP script to set-up the LDAP =
environment.

Over time we added Open Directory which is what OS X used after NetInfo. =
I still use directory services and have used OS X Server=E2=80=99s =
Directory Server as a kerberized LDAP server or Linux and server =
user=E2=80=99s accounts. This required get the Linux servers to bind =
using SASL to my kerbierized server.

That has been my experience and with the changes coming to OS X server =
I=E2=80=99m now moving towards OpenBSD but plan on bringing the OS X and =
it=E2=80=99s Directory Server with me as long as it lasts:)

Let me know if you have specific questions,

Ben
