​Indeed - problem was it ​was in a PDP-10/20 *flavor* and would compile on
a Vax, without *much* hacking - I know I moved it once.  It was a real
PITA.    Eventually folks would migrate to C implementations.

​That was the issue, everyone 'fixed it' and the fixes were all all
different.   Eventually market place pressure of the PC made Turbo Pascal
enough of a standard because so many people were using it, but by that
time, the war had been lost.

All the things Brian points out that made C great, made it the language
commercial folks used for both the PC and UNIX.​
