I'm not talking about legit holes, I'm talking about where your data used
be served up as a list of zeros.

The SCCS checksum is weak but kinda handy.  You could see single bit errors
with it (at least you could in BitKeeper).  It would say 

checksum error: wanted %d, got %d

and you could look at the numbers and see that it was one bit off.

We found a bunch of those because computers used to be ECC or parity and
then 15 years ago or so, they just dumped the parity bit so single bit
errors go unreported (noice, computer industry).
