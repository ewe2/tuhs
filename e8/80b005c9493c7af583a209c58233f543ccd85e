Michael Sokolov, it was, that writted:

  Then why don't YOU release it as open source?  Yes, you personally.
  Pull out your personal copy of the source (I sure hope you've had enough
  brains to smuggle one home with you when you left HP/Comfuq), put it on
  a bunch of Free Software FTP sites (IFCTF would gladly host it), and
  announce it to the world.  And while you are at it, shoot a few cops and
  hang their heads on a wall as war trophys (in the humanity's war for
  liberation of all software, of course).

You silly, twisted boy, you.
