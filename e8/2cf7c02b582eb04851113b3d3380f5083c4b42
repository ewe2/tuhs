Termcap and termlib from 2BSD should work fine on standard V6/V7 - 
that's what they were originally written for.  You don't need curses for 
vi or emacs, they have their own comparable code internally.  In fact, 
the original 2BSD curses from Ken Arnold was basically the vi code 
pulled out into a separate library.

Warren Montgomery's emacs was internal to Bell Labs and intended for 
Bell Labs versions of PDP-11 UNIX, not 2BSD, although I recall it was 
often ported to the Vax. I can't recall which version of UNIX they ran 
in the various Computer Centers in the early 1980s when this happened, 
but I doubt it was V7; probably PWB or UNIX/TS. It would have had the 
Ritchie C compiler. I can't recall if it used termcap or had the 
terminals hardcoded - apparently both, according to this:
