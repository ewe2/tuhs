I had an 11/70 service manual as an ebook at one stage, it had full
schematics etc, you also have access to various simulators to help you
understand the programming interface so i can't see what other info you
would need for your restoration, maybe you'd need help jerry rigging some
setup to get an initial tape written to get u started?

If you have any questions about the schematics or electrical
troubleshooting I'm happy to help although I have never owned a physical
pdp11... concepts are the same as any more modern system.

cheers, Nick
