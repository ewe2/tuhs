I would love to give it a shot.  I was thinking about trying to get
Hercules going on a laptop this weekend while I was in Houston but I didn=
=E2=80=99t
get around to it so I will probably set up a Pi when I get back.  The
v6-1/2 port seems neat.  When and if I have something running I will add
the systems to mvsevm.fsf.net.
