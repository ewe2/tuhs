Huh, that's a trip down memory lane.  I didn't have that one but the first
PC I ever owned was a CP/M machine made by the same company.  Marketed in
this country under the BMC name but it was made by Oki.

2nd one down here:

http://www.classiccmp.org/dunfield/miscpm/index.htm

I took out a $2000 loan and bought it in 1984 or 1985 because the
alternative was a VAX 11/780 that had about 30-40 people trying to
compile their projects at the same time.  I believe it had 4M of
ram, definitely not enough for the load.

You'd think a 64K z80 with floppies would be a down grade, it was not,
the performance was predictable, I didn't get swapped out for minutes,
it was always working just for me.

I wrote a _ton_ of code on that machine.
