The archive files already have the email addresses minimally obfuscated
(with "at"), and are already available in the right hand column at
http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/ (which is probably a softer
target for spam bots than the archive itself) - it seems unlikely that
putting them in as-is would increase the amount of spam people get.
