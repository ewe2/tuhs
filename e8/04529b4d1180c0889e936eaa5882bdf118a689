On OSF/1 T1.0, which is what we got shipped with our first Alphas, we were c=
ategorically told by REO that we were on our own. At the time there were fou=
r Alphas in the UK: three were ours and one was at REO running OpenVMS in th=
e morning and OSF/1 in the afternoon (or vice-versa) and we spent a long wee=
kend napping on the machine room floor and on caffeine trying to figure out h=
ow to get /usr mounted despite the SIA startup script as we had no choice an=
d the cluster needed to be up as it had cost a small fortune.

The later DEC solution I recall requiring more disk space on the clients, wh=
ich we didn=E2=80=99t have, but I=E2=80=99m sure that later ships with suffi=
cient disk space had less issues.

Another weekend was spent getting TeX and LaTeX running with ghostscript MX=E2=
=80=99d from the Ultrix MIPS binary as we just couldn=E2=80=99t get it to co=
mpile. That it even worked using MX remains one of the most beautiful surpri=
ses of that install.
