Thanks for that; I only have the Penguin for porting porpoises, not for 
daily use.  I write stuff on the Mac (because the USB ports are right in 
front of me), test it on a known reliable server like FreeBSD, then go and 
see what the penguins have broken this time...[*]

Yes, I do have a certain amount of contempt for a userbase that blithely 
ignores and rewrites history to the utter exclusion of Unix, such as over 
on Wikipedia where they claimed that they were the first to use "/dev/fb" 
to access the frame buffer; I've since corrected that arrant nonsense.
