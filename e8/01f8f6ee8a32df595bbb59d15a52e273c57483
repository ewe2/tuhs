Thanks for correcting my hasty conclusions.  /usr/source/s2/rm.c has an
execl call in the rm() function, but I didn't dig further into the
calling mechanism.  

V7's /usr/src/cmd/rm.c definitely explicitly has a check for '..' and 
an error message dedicated to the task.  

So I think we can conclude that unix got this protection sometime
between V6 and V7 -- in other words, sometime in the late 1970s. 

And systemd is now catching up.  "Those who do not study unix" etc
