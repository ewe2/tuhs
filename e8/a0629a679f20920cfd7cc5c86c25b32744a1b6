John Reiser did do his own paging system for UNIX 32/V.
I heard about it from friends at Bell Labs ca. 1982-83,
when I was still running systems for physicists at Caltech.
It sounded very interesting, and I would love to have had
my hands on it--page cache unified with buffer cache,
copy-on-write from the start.

The trouble is that Reiser worked in a different group
from the original UNIX crowd, and his management didn't
think his time well spent on that work, so it never got
released.

I remember asking, either during my interview at the Labs
or after I started work there, why the 4.1 kernel had been
chosen instead of Reiser's.  It had to do with maintainability:
there were already people who could come in and hack on the
Berkeley system, as well as more using it and maintaining it,
whereas Reiser's system had become a unicorn.  Nobody in
1127 wanted to maintain a VM system or anything much close
to the VAX hardware.  So the decision was to stick with a
kernel for which someone else would do those things.

Once I'd been there for a year or so and settled in, I found
that I was actually looking after all that stuff, because I
was really interested in it.  (Which seemed to delight a lot
of people.)  Would we have ended up using Reiser's kernel had
I been there a couple of years earlier?  I don't know.

It is in any case a shame that jfr's code never saw the light
of day.  I really hope someone can find it on an old tape
somewhere and we can get it into the archive, if only because
I'd love to look at it.
