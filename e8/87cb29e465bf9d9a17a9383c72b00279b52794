Slides have been published, though maybe not through the EuroBSDCon site. I
wasn't aware that I could publish them there.

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/177KxOif5oHARyIdZHDq-OO67_GVtMkzIAlD=
X-cHxgb4/edit?usp=3Dsharing

I'm told it will be a small number of weeks before the bsdtv folks that
taped everything can edit the talks down from the raw footage and post them
to youtube. They have the raw livestream, but a small number of tweaks need
to be made to each talk.

I'll be writing a followup paper, as well as an article for the FreeBSD
Journal. There's a number of small technical errors in the talk owing to
two factors: (1) I couldn't see my speaker notes during the talk so I think
I misspoke or neglected to include a clarifying sentence or two that I'd
planned and (2) I found more original material that helped to clarify
timelines (eg: PWB 1.0 was distributed outside of bell labs: it was V6 +
the "50 changes" based, but still retained features like the V6 TTY driver.
This was in 1978, about a year before V7 was released. PWB 2.0 was fully V7
based and included updates to the tools PWB added, exact details TBD). I
did talk a little about the ambiguity between UNIX/TS and PWB/UNIX 3.0 in
the talk, but the details of that need to be ironed out a bit. I hope to go
through more original sources to figure all that out as different people
remember things slightly differently, and sometimes contemporary
documentation or scholarly papers contradicts the remembrance so I need to
sort that out better, as well as where I can run diffs between supposed
sources of things to find as much of the truth around this that I can.

I hope to give this talk again, with some tweaks, since it was well
received. It's been a while since my talks have provoked that much
enthusiastic energy in the room. Maybe FOSDEM, BSDCan and something Linux
oriented / related in the US.
