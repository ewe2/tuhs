When I took over running a labful of SunOS machines that were used by our 
CS students, one of the first thing I did was turn off a few things in the 
system call vector for UIDs higher than a "staff" cutoff.  That included 
things like chown, chmod and setting the umask.  As well as making it 
harder for them to share solutions, it also had the advantage of making 
other systems more tempting targets...
