We can have an interesting discussion of the definition of "better ways".
I see termcap as a great solution for the days in which there was little
standardization.  But it's probably pretty hard to find a non-conforming
terminal nowadays so I think that it's better to avoid obfuscation.  Were
it me I would have a comment that referenced the page and section number
in the standard.

Since we like debating the merits of old technology, somebody can kick off
a termcap versus terminfo discussion :-)
