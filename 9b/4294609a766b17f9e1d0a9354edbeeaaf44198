I am also not happy with this behavior.

There is at least one "fix" I have found for this particular annoyance.

A little background: this behavior uses a pair of termcap entries called 
"ti" and "te" which, on most recent xterm implementations, switch 
between alternate screens.  Many programs on startup switch to the 
alternate screen to keep their displays separate from the normal command 
scroll buffer.

There is an xterm resource "titeInhibit" which, if set to true, will 
disable the remarkably annoying mode switch that is used by less (and 
also any other application that tries to use the screen swap).

Given this started out as a termcap thread, hopefully this will be 
appropriate!

This complete disable of the screen swap may not be what everyone is 
looking for, but it certainly was what I wanted.
