I wonder when that was...  *My* first 386 was the one I ran 386bsd on,
and later, when it came into existence, NetBSD.  It had good old ST506
type disk drives (20MB MFM drives, but I formatted them RLL to get 30MB
out of them).  Managed to get four such drives onto it, actually, by
modifying the driver to support multiple controllers, and then rewiring
one controller to hook it to a different interrupt line on the ISA bus.
