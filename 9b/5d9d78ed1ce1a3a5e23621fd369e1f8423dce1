Well, I haven't tried to do that (it's not something that I'm that interested
in), but it _should_ be possible, since the 'vanilla' V6 distribution does
include the source for pretty much everything (including the C compiler,
assembler, loader, etc).


(This does not include the stuff from the Shoppa disk, like the new C
compiler, where I don't have the source. [The PWB distribution, which
includes a C compiler from 1977, is probably pretty close. Looking into
the PWB stuff is one of my next projects; we have 17 different versions
of that stuff, and I'd like to see what the differences among them are,
and maybe create a 'canonical' PWB.]

Also, per the 'Improvements' page, I have source for the Standard I/O
Library, but I'm using the binary library from the Shoppa disk, which may or
may not correspond to that source.)
