This is perhaps a side note but I believe all structure fields shared a 
namespace.  So stat.size and whatever.size were not allowed, they collided.
So we got sb.st_size which I personally love and wish it were still like
that.

xyz.size
abc.size
foobar.size

What are the types of those structures?

abc.st_size

Huh, abc is a struct stat.

I get that it was a bug and needed to be fixed but I wish that everyone 
still pretended that it was one namespace, makes code so much easier to
read.
