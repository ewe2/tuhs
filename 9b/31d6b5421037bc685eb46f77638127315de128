The 3B2 was not the same machine as the one in 5ESS, which
was/is the 3B20D, a fairly large duplexed machine (two processors
that mutually checked each other).  The 3B2 was a desktop.
The 3B20D wasn't sold commercially, as far as I know.  There
was a 3B20S (multi-cabinet) that at least nominally
was commercially available.

Their ISAs were not quite the same, but some assembler language
tricks made the assembler-level languages look quite similar.
