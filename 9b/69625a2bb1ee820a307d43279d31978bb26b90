Having spend time in both areas 10 and 20, there were more advanced degrees
in area 10.  But, it was really low key.  You wouldn't know unless you asked.

One of the nice benefits at BTL is that they had a program for employees to
get advanced degrees.  I was told that if I decided to work there post college
that I would need to plan on going for an advanced degree.

There are many different definitions of success.  I agree that John was successful
at making money, and as being part of a team that made free software what it is
today.  But that's not the definition for pre-divestiture BTL.  They were a research
and development lab.  Success meant blazing new trails and inventing.  I don't
think that BTL was specifically looking for people with PhDs, they were looking for
people who had a history of doing good research.  During most of BTLs history one
found those people by reading dissertations.  People who had no degree, much less
an advanced degree, were researcher-wannabees, not proven researchers.  They didn't
hire Shannon because they liked his name, I'd guess that his master's theses opened
the door.

Another way to look at it is that one could certainly become financially successful
by reimplementing tar as free software, but the invention of tar is successful
research.

The only way that I got my foot in the door was because Heinz and Carl knew me through
the Explorer Scout post.  My unscientific survey of summer students was that they either
came from scouts, or were people working on advanced degrees in college.
