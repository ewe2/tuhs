Subject: [TUHS] Happy birthday, Ray Tomlinson!
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.21.1804230729220.767@aneurin.horsfall.org>

Ray Tomlinson, computer pioneer, was born on this day in 1941.  He is 
credited with inventing this weird thing called "email" on the ARPAnet, in 
particular the "@" sign to designate a remote host (although some jerk -- 
his name is not important -- is claiming that he was first).
