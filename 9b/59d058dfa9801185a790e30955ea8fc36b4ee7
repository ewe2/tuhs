I kind of figured that's why the PDP-11 & z8000 sys3 stuff up &
disappeared...   Although I have to wonder, as someone who paid SCO
(Old sco I think) the $100 for an ancient unix license, what did it
cover again?

It was sooooo long ago..  But I'm guessing it was research 1-7 & 32v...?

Wait I see what it covered in here:

http://minnie.tuhs.org/Seminars/Saving_Unix/

While i'd love to have some kind of sysv for a vax (even the 780 which
simh can run...) I would suspect the license cost would simply be
astronomical... lol it'd be probably more feasable to port Solaris 10
to the 11/780... (yes I'm kidding!).

There is also a wealth of information on googles "groups" with
information from the 1980's taken from usenet backup tapes, it would
be 'neat' to have them online in some kind of NNTP server that tin or
pine could actually read... So you could browse this massive
'database' of unix knowledge from an ancient unix (well one that has
either local news with all the google groups, or a TCP enabled
unix...)

Anyways I can tell I'm rambling, and the cat is jumping on the
keyboard so I'm off to bed.
