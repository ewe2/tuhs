&gt; &gt;&gt; The story of the mice, one of which I gave to John:<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I ran a program called FAST-OS for LANL/Sandia for 6=C2=A0 ye=
ars starting<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2005. Think of it as &quot;Plan 9 on petaflop supercomputers&=
quot; -- it may<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; seem strange now, but in that era when some top end systems r=
an custom<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; kernels, there was a strong case to be made that plan 9 was a=
 good<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; choice. By 2011, of course, the Linux tsunami had swept all b=
efore it,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; which is why you no longer hear about custom HPC kernels so m=
uch --<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; though in some places they still reign. In any event, this pr=
ogram<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; gave me 6 years to work with &quot;the Unix room&quot;, or wh=
at was left of it.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I had been in the Unix Room in 1978, and even met Dennis, so =
this<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; prospect was quite a treat.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; We funded Charles Forsyth to write the amd64 compilers for Pl=
an 9,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; which if you used early Go you ran into (6c 6a 6l); we also f=
unded the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; amd64 port of Plan 9 (a.k.a. k10) as well as the port to Blue=
 Gene.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; That amd64 port is still out and about. You can find the Blue=
 Gene<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; kernel on github.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I had lots of fun spending time in the Unix room while workin=
g with<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the late Jim McKie, and others. I saw the tail end of the tra=
ditions.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; They had cookie day once a week, if memory serves, on Thursda=
y at 3. I<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; got to see the backwards-running clock, Ken&#39;s chess troph=
ies, his<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; pilot&#39;s license, pictures of Peter everywhere, a &quot;Re=
agan&#39;s view of the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; world&quot; map, the American Legion award for Telstar (which=
 was rescued<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; from a dumpster!), and so on. The &quot;Unix room&quot; was m=
ore than one room,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; all built on a raised floor, as I assume it was former old sc=
hool<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; machine room space. If memory serves, it filled the entire wi=
dth of<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the end of the top floor of the building it was in (4th floor=
?) --<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; maybe 50 ft x 50 ft -- maybe a bit more. There was a room wit=
h desks,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; and a similar-sized room with servers, and a smaller room con=
taining a<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; lab-style sink, a very professional cappucinno machine, decad=
es of old<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; proceedings, and a sofa. I fixed the heavy-duty coffee grinde=
r one<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; year; for some reason the Italian company that produced it ha=
d seen<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; fit to switch BOTH hot and neutral, and the fix was to only s=
witch<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; hot, as the neutral switch had failed; I guess in the EU, wit=
h 220v,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; things are done differently.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; It was fun being there. A few years later the whole room, and=
 all its<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; history, was trashed, and replaced with what Jim called a &qu=
ot;middle<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; management wxx dream&quot; (Jim was never at a loss for words=
); Jim found<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; some yellow Police crime scene tape and placed it in front of=
 the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; doors to the new space. It was redubbed &quot;the innovation =
space&quot; or some<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; such, and looked kind of like an ikea showroom. Much was lost=
. I tried<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to find a way to save the contents of the room; I had this dr=
eam of<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; recreating it at Google, much as John Wanamaker&#39;s office =
was preserved<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; in Philadelphia for so many decades, but I was too late. I ha=
ve no<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; idea where the contents are now. Maybe next to the Ark.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; One day in 2008 or so jmk took me for a tour of the buildings=
, and we<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; at one point ended up high in the top floor of what I think w=
as<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Building One (since torn down?), in what used to be Lab Suppl=
y. Nobody<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; was there, and not much supply was there either. Finally some=
body<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; wandered in, and Jim asked where everyone was. &quot;Oh, they=
 closed lab<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; supply, maybe 4 years ago?&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Bell Labs had seen hard times since the Lucent split, and it =
was clear<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; it had not quite recovered, and Lab Supply was just one sign =
of it. I<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; think the saddest thing was seeing the visitor center, which =
I first<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; saw in 1976. In 1976, it was the seat of the Bell System Empi=
re, and<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; it was huge. There was a map of the US with a light lit for e=
very<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; switching office in the Bell Labs system. There was all kinds=
 of Bell<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Labs history in the visitor center museum.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; The museum had shrunk to a much smaller area, and felt like a=
 closet.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; The original transistor was still there in 2010, but little e=
lse.The<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; library was, similarly, changed: it was dark and empty, I was=
 told.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Money was saved. At that time, Bell Labs felt large, strangel=
y quiet,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; and emptied of people. It made me think of post-sack Rome, ca=
. 600,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; when its population was estimated to be 500. I have not been =
back<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; since 2011 so maybe things are very different. It would be ni=
ce if so.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; As part of this tour, Jim gave me 3 depraz mice. I took one, =
gutted<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; it, (sorry!), and filled its guts with a USB mouse innards, a=
nd gave<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; it back to Jim. He then had a Depraz USB mouse. jmk&#39;s mou=
se did not<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; have any lead in it, as John&#39;s did, however. The second I=
 gave to<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; someone at Google who had worked at the labs back in the day.=
 The<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; third mouse I gave to John, and he made it live again, which =
is cool.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; In spite of their reputation, I found Depraz mice hard to use=
. I have<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; gone through all kinds of mice, and am on an evoluent, and as=
 far as<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Depraz go, I guess &quot;you had to be there&quot;. I don&#39=
;t recall if jmk used<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; his &quot;usb depraz&quot; or it ended up on a shelf. Sadly, =
I can no longer ask<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; him.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;ll be interested to see what John thinks of the Depraz.=

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Ah, right. I opened the mouse because one of the encoder=

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A closer look showed that they were the wrappers which c=
over the corks<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; of wine bottles. Up into the 1980s, these were made out of le=
ad, and by<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; flattening five of them, a previous owner of the mouse was ab=
le to add<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; quite a bit of extra weight to it:<br>
