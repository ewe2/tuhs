Right, I remember that was mixed up in it.   CMU (Andy "My hand is in your
pocket" Carnegie) was willing to abide by the IBM terms and MIT (Paul "You
gotta be kidding me" Gray) was not.   So IBM got the IP from Andrew, while
Athena was FOSS.â€‹  IBM would eventually Open Source most of it.   But
originally, it was all private to them.
