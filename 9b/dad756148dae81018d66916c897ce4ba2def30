Can't speak for today.  At one point the S stood for Standard/Stable.  That
used to be a Culter-ism IIRC -- it was what was guaranteed to ISVs to be
there.  If you used anything else, Microsoft could (and did) pull the rug
out from under you.

They added a bunch of new APIs and new stuff from 64 bits to et al.   When
Interix was done, all that they could guarantee was Cutler's interface.

I agree.  However, I have spent much of my career on corporate Windows

WSL should not have that problem these days for the exact reasons you
mentioned, as you were correct that SFU/SUA did tend to be something that
IT depts did not understand like (it was free but it was separate
install).  But WSL is just one of the standard options in Windows10 ever
system can have it.  You just have to enable it in the control panel and it
will automatically do everything in a manner that should not be an issue to
IT folks.   Although it does require >>local<< admin privileges on the
machines to enable.; IIRC.
