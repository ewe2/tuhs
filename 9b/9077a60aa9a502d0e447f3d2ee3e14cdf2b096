Subject: booting archived Sys III and Ultrix 3.x images
Message-ID: <199910202028.NAA49448@mrynet.com>

Has anyone successfully booted either the System III 
(...Distributions/usdl/SysIII/) or Ultrix (...Distritutions/dec/Ultrix*)
tape images?  I don't have a real PDP-11 any more, however both the
Begemot P11 and the Supnik emulators produce the following on a 
generated boot disk:

#0=unixhptm
ka6 = 1535
aps = 141774
pc = 1476 ps = 30010
trap type 0
ka6 = 1535
aps = 141666
pc = 113444 ps = 30300
trap type 0
panic: trap

The Ultrix images both fail to actually boot from tape, as they
quit after reading the first boot block.  Thus I am unable get as
far as being able to generate a disk image for booting.

I'm somewhat confident that my tape image booting and system generation
procedures used with the Supnik emulator are working properly, since I
successfully generate disk systems from both the V7 (Bostic) and
the 2.11BSD boot-tape images.

Any info and interest of others gleefully appreciated :)
