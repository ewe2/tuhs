I remember playing ZORK (dungeo) in college on a VAX 11/750 which was
a PDP-11 a.out run in emulation mode (well, to be honest it was even more
complex than that, since there was a shell script to open all the data files on
specific FDs, setup some weird environment variables and then the PDP-11
program was run). The image looked to be converted from an RT-11 version
of the program that I ran under RSTS/E on a PDP-11/34 while working for a
small database company in high school…

I’d always wondered how that came to be, and what tools were needed to
run it...
