The VAX 11/750 with 1MB we had at nmt ran emacs, but not gnu emacs. It was
something special off the internet that was less featureful so took less
memory. We had to have it since EMACS was popular on the DECsystem 20s we
had.. The Vax could handle 15 students on each of the 15 terminals
connected to it plus 5 or so coming in via telnet doing emacs compilein
100-500 line CS programs without being too insanely bogged down... < 10 and
you didn't notice.

Emacs of different flavors predated workstations by a few years though. GNU
Emacs 18 dates to when VAXstations, Suns and others were shipping on
volume.

All the oddball quirks in tty behavior can be dated to the early 80s to
optimize somebody's use case...
