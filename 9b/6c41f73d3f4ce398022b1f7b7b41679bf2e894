Hi Ted,

True, but hasn't static analysis come on since then?  I don't use them,
but tools like http://ffevotte.github.io/clang-tags/ build on clang's
work to allow queries like finding all mentions of st_size AFAIK.
They'll even cope with two different struct definitions with a st_size
kicking about and use the one you give as a seed reference.

I'm surprised with things like DWARF in ELF that compilers weren't used
to generate a super `ctags' longer ago.  We had cscope, that was Bell
Labs IIRC.  And then there's been GNU GLOBAL, GNU's idutils, ...
