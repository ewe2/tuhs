I'm not sure the term is Unix-specific. At a fairly early stage, people who
worked on the ARPANET/Internet (when PDP-10's were still the 'usual' host, and
Unix systems were just starting to beceome common) were jokingly known as
'network grey-beards': the prototypical one being Jon Postel. (Vint Verf's
beard was too tidy to qualify, IIRC!)
