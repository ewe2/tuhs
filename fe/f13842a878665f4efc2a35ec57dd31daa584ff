Subject: nondisclosure clause in SCO license
Message-ID: <199812142217.QAA03614@fudge.uchicago.edu>

Does anyone know how serious SCO is about enforcing the nondisclosure
clause from the Ancient Unix license?  I'm referring to this one:

   8.4 (a) LICENSEE agrees that it shall hold all parts of the
   SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS subject to this Agreement in confidence for
   SCO.  LICENSEE further agrees that should it make such disclosure
   of any or all of such SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS (including methods or
   concepts utilized therein) to anyone to whom such disclosure is
   necessary to the use for which rights are granted hereunder,
   LICENSEE shall appropriately notify each such person to whom any
   such disclosure is made that such disclosure is made in
   confidence and shall be kept in confidence and have each such
   person sign a confidentiality agreement containing restrictions
   on disclosure substantially similar to those set forth herein.

So if I mention to someone that (for instance) the Sixth Edition
version of ed didn't have the "j" command but it was in PWB and the
Seventh Edition, and I know this from reading the source code, are the
SCO police going to come after me?

I hope not Eric. I'll ask SCO for their impressions, and will pass them
back on to the mailing list.

I recently bought a PDP-11/73.  It has one RD-52A MFM hard drive that
boots up to RSTS, eight serial ports (besides the console), and what looks
like a SCSI connector on the back (labeled TK25, so I assume this is the
tape drive connector).

I have connected it to my PC and I am able to either boot it up from the
hard drive or start up into the ROM monitor.  Unfortunately, at this point
I can't continue because the PDP won't receive anything through the
console serial port.

Does anybody know if there are any quirks about the serial port on this
machine that would cause this (if, for instance, the PDP-11 required some
sort of handshaking that my PC doesn't do).  Also, there is a block of dip
switches on the CPU card that appear to affect booting and serial port
stuff.  Does anyone know where there is a list of what these switches
control?  Furthermore....  Between the cryptically labeled switch that
chooses monitor or boot mode and the knob that changes the baud rate is a
knob with three settings labeled with an arrow, a talking head, and an
uppercase T with an arrow orbiting it.  What does this knob do?  

Finally, assuming that the UART on the CPU board is fried and the entire
CPU board needs to be replaced before it will work again, what are the
chances I could get someone who has the Unix source code to compile me a
kernel that uses one of the other serial ports as the console?

Thanks in advance for all of the help that I know you people will send me.

Am I correct in assuming that up until RSTS/E is started, the console
serial port seems to work fine?   i.e. you can talk to ODT?

>Does anybody know if there are any quirks about the serial port on this

RSTS/E might be picky about parity bits in some cases.  (Heaven knows
that it's incredibly picky about some other things!)

On the other hand, your PC might not be seeing the RTS/CTS (I forget
which one it'll actually be looking for) and this is the reason your
keystrokes never go out.  Or it might not be seeing DSR and refusing
to send keystrokes because of this.  Have you configured your comm 
software for XON/XOFF and *not* hardware flow control?

It selects power-on mode.  I think arrow means to boot straight from the
default device, talking head means to go to interactive console dialog,
and the T with the circle around it means infinite test loop.

I'm sure it can be done, but I don't know of any that are easily persuaded
to do this!  It'd be far easier to disable your CPU board's console
port and drop in a separate DLV11-type interface.

All,

I was thinking of trying to update my `History of UNIX' diagram at
http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/TUHS/Images/unixtimeline.gif, to bring it up
to date and make it more accurate. The current status of my update is at:
	
	http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/Unix_History/

I'm missing details on many of the commercial versions of UNIX:

	+ SunOS/Solaris
	+ SysVR4.x
	+ Ultrix
	+ Xenix
	+ Unixware :-)
	+ BSDI stuff
	+ lots more

If anybody can supply release dates and relationships for systems that I
don't have yet, could you email them to me with a reference where possible.

This is going to be a back-burner project, I'll do a bit here and there, but
hopefully by sometime next year we'll have a large wall-sized family tree
for UNIX.

Cheers,
	Warren

   I have looked at it. Note that the data files are not hyperlinked. I
don't think this is intentional, is it?
   
   Being the TUHS 4BSD Coordinator :-), I feel obligated to do some work on
the 4bsd data file. Quoting:

   Are you sure that virtual memory appears first in 3BSD? I have always
thought that it's a 4BSD milestone. Page replacement and demand paging
probably go with it.

   Sorry, I don't know the Ultrix version (don't even know if it's a
release and not some DEC internal code), but it's obviously among the very
first.

   I know that SunOS and Ultrix played key roles in the history of BSD
(huge bidirectional exchange of code and ideas between CSRG, Sun, and DEC),
but I don't know anything about versions and such.

The first virtual memory release was 3BSD. It's performance was

OK, I've dragged out some old tapes which may be of some interest:

Tandem NonStop UX for Tandem LXN (68020), effectively System V.2, 10
April 1987.

Tandem NonStop-UX B00 for Tandem LXN (68020), effectively System
V.3.0, dated 22 August 1989.

Tandem NonStop-UX B10 for Tandem LXN (68020), effectively System
V.3.1, dated 20 September 1989.

Consensys UNIX System V.4.2.1.0, in PaCkAgE DaTaStReAm mode (yup,
that's what it says).  I'm not sure how reliable this is, but the
first package has the PSTAMP destiny921114141358, which presumably can
be interpreted as a date; certainly it's plausible.

BSD BSD/386, version 0.3.2.  The tar archive has the date Feb 28 09:18
1992 on the first few files; presumably this is US MST.

Univel Unixware 1.0, also this funny PaCkAgE DaTaStReAm.  This one has
a PSTAMP=SVR4.2 11/02/92.  I'd assume that they really meant 2
November 1992.

I've got a number of old CDs which I haven't looked at yet.  I'd guess
that I have most FreeBSD releases, and we can find the rest.

All I recall about pre 4.0 was that we were using SunOS 3.5 in '88. I'd
like to think 3.2 came out in '85 or '86--but memory isn't what it used
to be...

More research: first patch in Sun patch library:

	Patch-ID# 100001-01
	Keywords:       cc stack overflow local variable
	Synopsis: C compiler: stack overflow: too many local variables
	Date: 20-Apr-88

	SunOS release:
        	3.4, 3.5


Sun's bug database still contains bug reports going back to 3.2 (heck,
even 2.2 and 1.0) but none of them have dates ;(((

A couple of lesser known BSDish oddities from Big Blue....

Add IBM's AOS.  That was a straight 4.3BSD port dating from 1987 or 1988.
This was the only official port for the RT-PC hardware.

Add IBM's unofficial ``Reno'' port.  That was a somewhere between 4.3/4.4
port dating from 1991 or 1992.   It was apparently done by IBM or IBM
contractors.  It looks very straight 4.4, in appearance.

Add IBM's unoffical ``4.4Lite'' port.  That was a somewhere between 4.4
and the real Lite dating from 1994 or 1995.  It was apparently done by
IBM or IBM contractors, with source trees from two development streams
combined together to resolve developmental divergences.

They all were used on the RT-PC hardware (ROMP Risc processor).

The 4.3 is very nice.  Code size about 75 megs binary.  It runs fine
on a small machine with 8 megs ram and 115 megs HD, or the biggest
RT class machine.  The C compilers are slightly broken, but usually
can be worked around (good old pcc seems the best).

The Reno is fair to good, but missing things like working tape I/O.
You can tar or dump, but no other tape functions work correctly.
Code size about 150 megs binary.  It needs 16M ram and 300mb HD.
I dunno exactly how ``Reno'' it really is.

The 4.4Lite is fair to good, but still missing working tape I/O.
Code size about 300 megs binary.  It needs 16M ram and 300mb HD.
Bloat seems to have set in on this one, since the whole system is
well over 1 gig in size.  It barely will run on two 300mb HD.
The login says it is 4.4Lite and not straight 4.4.  There is no
indication of how pure ``Lite'' it really is.

I dunno anything about how these originated developmentally, but
the AOS seems to be vanilla 4.3BSD and all else may have developed
from that, possibly after the RT line became back-burner stuff.
I would be very interested in any history from anyone on the list
that was around IBM at the time on these.

.......

Add Xenix for the Radio Shack 16B machines on 8 inch floppers.
That seems to date from around 1982 or 1983, although I have
misplaced my disks on that one, and don't have the machine anymore.
I was thinking someone on the list had one of those beasts running?

That is all I can think of offhand to add.....

Bob Keys

p.s.  Anyone got a spare V7ish Xenix they would part with for x86
      hardware?  I would like to try a native suite rather than
      an emulator, if possible.  There were one or two such ports
      I am thinking like Xenix, Microport, or PC-IX maybe?  I just
      missed one a few days ago at out state surplus house, when I
      picked it up, looked at it, set it down, and then someone
      else grabbed it... oh, well....(:+{{.....

Please do!  I would like to see that.  I did see at one time Tahoe
mentioned, but I did not understand how the IBM ports were related
through that.  There are so few folks around that know anything about
these IBM critters, even on the old RT newsfeed.  Most of the stuff
has become dumpster fodder, sadly, although I had the good fortune
this past week to resurrect two RT's from the dumpster, and get one
up by combining sufficient parts to get it to boot.

What specifically would one look for to exactly differentiate
a vanilla 4.3, from a Tahoe, from a Reno, from a 4.4, from a 4.4Lite,
on non-standard hardware?  The books get somewhat obscure on this
unless running VAXen or HP300's or such.  The RT is a little bit
non-standard.  I was thinking it was a 68000ish machine in IBM's
wrappers, but others have said it was distinctly different from a
68000 based line.  Also, I can't find anyone that was in on the
AOS project enough to know from whence it was originally derived.
The dating seems to be 1987 or 1988.  Was Tahoe around then?
Salus suggests straight 4.3 was June of 1986, and Tahoe was June
of 1988 (Salus, p. 165).  Anyone around CSRG then that remembers
when IBM got what code?  Salus does not mention any IBM AOS stuff,
only the mainframe stuff.  AOS seems to be mostly a sleeper, almost
forgotten in time.

There is a Finnish repository that has some of it relating to the 4.3
port, and one or two other RTish archives.  Try something like jumo.luti.fi,
or jumi.luto.fi, or something like that, but I don't have the url exactly,
and can't find the stick'em note where I ran across it.

Yes, there was an IBM'er that said he had some original tapes.  I was
hoping he would check with someone at IBM to see what the status was.
There was a group at Carnegie-Mellon that had some machines with AOS,
but I don't have any pointers to anyone up there, for sure.  I would
hope the old RT boxes and AOS would fall under the Antique Unix umbrella,
and thus, be amenable to the PUPS archives scope of things.  But, I
am only a newbie voice in the crowd.....

From what I have found out, there were two install tapes and two boot
floppies.

The main boot floppy is the sautils disk (stand alone utilities).
That then loads a miniroot floppy that does the scripted install.
The scripts don't work unless you have the original tapes, and
the orignal hardware configuration which was a pair of 70mb esdi
drives.  The installation needs to be done manually, instead, if
the hardware differs from that.  It should be a straight 4.3 style
restore process.  I guess they expected only to have dual 70mb
esdi drives in the old RT tower machines, as AOS platforms.

The first tape is the combined root and user dumps to hd0a and hd0g.

That is how I understand it.  There were some manuals for it, but
noone seems to know anything about those anymore, and what info I
have is more sketchy than for sure.  There was also some other machine
called an ``Academic Machine'' that was a siamesed ROMP processor
on a Model 60 PS/2 MCA bus machine.  I have not exactly understood
how that thing actually worked, and noone on the net seems to have
one, although there are two ROMP boards that are reputed to still
exist that plug into the MCA Model 60 PS/2 box.  Apparently the
Model 60 was the terminal/disk IO system and the ROMP board ran
the BSD.

The thing will tar/dump to the tape, but won't retension or erase
correctly.  If you know what that patch was, I would be interested
in it, for sure.  I assume it has to do with something like twiddling
the right hardware ports with the right bit patterns, maybe, to run
the retension and erase functions on the hardware.  I am curious,
though, and wonder if something like the 4.3 mt, which does work,
would work correctly in the Lite suite.  I was of the impression
that there was some binary compatibility between 4.3 and 4.4/4.4-Lite,
but I am not sure.

I have no idea how pure or impure the code is.  I came along so late
in the song and dance act that I don't know enough of the internals
to compare, yet.  So much to learn.....  Years ago I bounced this
off our IBM rep, but went to AIX on the PS/2, instead of the RT BSD.
I did not know very much then, nor now....(:+{{.....

Who all on the list were IBM'ers in that era that might still remember
enough of this to fill us in?  The history is half the fun, and sure
makes the perspective on the rest more interesting and well rounded.

Anyone on the list actually playing around and running an RT?

Dear PUPS/TUHS members,

While exchanging tapes and tape images with a number of people on this list, I
have mentioned the existence of this program to a number of people, but so far
I haven't given it to anyone. Now I'm posting it to the list for everyone's
benefit. This program can read a tape on a UNIX box without the user having to
know anything about its format. This program automatically determines how many
files are on the tape, what is the record size for each, and whether there are
any oddities such as partial records. It saves each tape file into a separate
disk file and produces a log of everything found on the tape.

It's a simple C program and should compile and run on virtually any UNIX or
UNIX-like system. The original version was written by one guy I met on another
list once and then it was significantly enhanced by me. I include it below as
a uuencoded gzipped tarball.

Sincerely,
Michael Sokolov

No, the ROMP (the RT's CPU) is a RISC CPU.  I have a processor reference
for the C-ROMP (the CMOS version that was on the 6152 Academic
Workstation), but I only have hardcopy.

That would probably be me.  I'm still looking - I have a call in right now
to someone who might be able to help.

Best bet would probably be someone at the ITC or the CS department, or the
Andrew Consortium.  Don't really know many of those folks anymore, though,
and not sure if anyone from the right time period is still around.

I have one in my living room....  Yes, your description is pretty much
correct.  The C-ROMP co-processor plugs into the Model 60 (though I don't 
know why it couldn't be used with another type of Microchannel PS/2). The
co-processor card has the C-ROMP CPU, support hardware, and memory.  To
IPL the thing, you run a DOS program on the PS/2 that loads the boot
program into the C-ROMP memory, and twiddles some bits that start the
processor.  The C-ROMP board pretty much takes over the machine, and uses
the PS/2 itself as an I/O processor.
