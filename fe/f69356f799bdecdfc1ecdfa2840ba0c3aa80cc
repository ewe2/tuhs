I started work at Demon Internet in 1997. Its origins before 1992 were in
SCO / Xenix consultancy, but by the time I joined the ISP systems were
mostly flavours of BSD and Sun. My colleagues didn't think Linux was
sufficiently good at networking, and I got the impression that was a
relatively common opinion in ISP circles around 1995/6. That kind of
suggests to me that Unix would have been helped by the rise of the
Internet even without Linux...
