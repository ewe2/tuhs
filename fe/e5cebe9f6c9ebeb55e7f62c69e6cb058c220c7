Looking at something like the IBM 370 series (mid-1970s), I/O was
performed by the channels, effectively separate processors with a very
limited instruction set.  Others, like the UNIVAC 1100 series, could
perform I/O directly or via separate processors.  This was similar on
the /360, but very different on the 1401.

In each case, from my recollection, main memory and the peripheral
were the bottleneck.  For the UNIVAC 1108 (1965, the one of which I
have the best recollection), memory was 36 bits every 750 ns, and you
could expect it to be interleaved at least 2 ways, so you could
transfer data across two channels to a FH 432 drum at in the order of
2.5 MW/s.  This could lead to underruns depending on what else was
going on in the system.  Other peripherals were slower, so this would
have been about the maximum.
