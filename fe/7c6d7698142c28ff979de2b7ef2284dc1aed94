If recall correctly, the last time someone tried to submit patches,
they overloaded some signal that was in use, and it was NACK'ed on
that basis.  I personally didn't care, because on my systems, I'll use
GUI program like xload, or if I need something more detailed, GKrellM.
(And GKreelM can be used to remotely monitor servers as well.)

It's used in Solaris to report that the client NFSv4 code could not
recover a file lock on recovery.  So that means one of the first
places to look would be to see if Ganesha (an open-source NFSv4
user-space client) isn't using SIGLOST (or might have plans to use
SIGLOST in the feature).

For a remote / distributed file system, Brewer's Theorem applies
---  Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance --- chose any
two, but you're not always going to be able to get all three.
