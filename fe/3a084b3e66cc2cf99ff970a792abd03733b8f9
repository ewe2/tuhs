Depends on your point of view a bit.... One can probably say that Oracle
Solaris has been "pulled back".  But, Solaris has sufficiently escaped
in a form that is still open source, if you ignore Oracle.  The company
which is my $DAYJOB uses Joyent Triton SmartOS, which is very Solaris in
every way and completely open source.  We run a couple of farily large
private clouds with it.
