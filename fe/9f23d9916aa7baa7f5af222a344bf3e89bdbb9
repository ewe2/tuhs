Subject: [TUHS] SCO then Caldera
Message-ID: <002201c22498$33b19460$14bd580c@who>

Hello from Gregg C Levine
The web site links, that contain the SCO location, now point to a site on
Caldera's site. I tried e-mailing someone via their contacts page, but so
far to no avail. Has anyone on the list had any favorable response,
regarding the ability to access their archives of the older versions of
UNIX? As always, I am interested in the versions of UNIX that are targeted
towards the PDP-11. Seriously though, has anyone actually gotten any
feedback from Caldera? Warren if you want to comment, please do so, and I'll
even accept a private one.
