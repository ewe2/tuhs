It’s far from perfect, but here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/bsd42/files/4BSD%20under%20Windows/v0/SUN3-research_v9.7z/download

This is my binary, config file and all that jazz…. It’s 40MB compressed and over 1GB uncompressed…

Have a pre-made image?

I'm busy fighting with an IPX that is convinced the motherboard is occasionally shorted.

For the 99% of us that don’t have a SUN-3, it’ll run on TME.  I followed the instructions on abiyo.net on installing SunOS 4.1.1 onto TME ( http://www.abiyo.net/retrocomputing/installingsunos411tosun3emulatedintme08onlinux ), and then added in the v9.tar file, and walked through the instructions on bootstrapping v9 from SunOS.
 
I just cheated by copying the SunOS disk into a new scsi disk so I didn’t have to go through the fun of labeling it.  TME emulates a SUN3-150 although the BIOS appears to be for a SUN3-160(?).. so the kernel unix.v75 will work when altering the proto0a file.
 
TME can be a little (lot!) touchy to get working, but with enough persistence you can get it booting the ‘funinthe’ v9 image.
