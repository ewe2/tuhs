	m68k SVR2 on Perq (was: web site detailing Apple's mc68k UNIX, A/UX)
Message-ID: <006401c3d153$cb7cf280$2301a8c0@burton>

Incidentally, the Unisoft m68k port of SVR2 at the core of A/UX was also
ported to the Perq-5 in 1986/1987, to create the Crosfield Studio 9500.

Perq had just folded, but a core group of ex-Perq employees worked with a
team from the UK company Crosfield Electronics to take the machine (which at
that time existed only as a wire-wrap prototype) through to production.

I was a member of that team and I have fond memories of sitting in a
basement office in Pittsburgh surrounded by kernel listings (with a very
puzzled look on my face).

Just a small footnote in Unix history...
