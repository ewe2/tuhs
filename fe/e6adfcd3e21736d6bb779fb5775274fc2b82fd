Not unique to DEC, I very much had that attitude at Sun and wasn't alone.
As a side effort from making SunOS POSIX compliant, I wrote lint libraries
for BSD, Sys III, Sys V, POSIX, and I don't remember what else.  The idea
was that you could use Sun as a dev platform but lint your code against
whatever platform you wanted to target.

It was misguided, I bet I can count on one hand the number of people that
used any of those, but I hated vendor traps as much as DEC, maybe more.
