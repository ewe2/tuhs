I have heard some grumblings of TOG possibly releasing CDE as open source,
but have no idea of where that stands.  To be perfectly frank, it had a
lot of problems, especially in a 64-bit world.  There were too many word
size assumptions, and a very good friend struggled for many, many hours
fixing those problems before it went to DEIL in India for support.  It
could probably still benefit from a good �many eyes� developer review and
bug fix session in the hands of open source developers.  However, IMHO, it
no longer has any advantage over KDE or Gnome, but, as I said, that is my
opinion.

Personally, I�d love to see OSF1 released open source.  There were
experimental x86 and two Itanium versions in various states of completion
floating around DEC/Compaq/HP.  I was part of the last Itanium effort
before the HP merger.  That one booted to single user before the project
was killed.

OSF1/Digital UNIX/Tru64 UNIX was already branded as UNIX, and it would be
fun to see what would happen to the landscape if a branded UNIX was free.
 Unfortunately, too many proprietary licensed pieces of code in the HP
version, especially in System V support, for that to ever happen. Oh well,
we can all dream �
