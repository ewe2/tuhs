A belated rejoinder to:

  This bug existed from (at least) the Fifth up until the Eighth
  editions from 1127 (BTL research). The Ninth edition had much

You're welcome.  I can't remember, though, whether I fixed it on
purpose or as part of the many general cleanups and restructurings
I did at that point.  And I didn't do enough of it; recently I
discovered a dumb problem that I probably introduced in the same
cleanups, wherein the i-node allocated for a file that couldn't be
created because the file system was full and the directory entry
couldn't be written was left allocated but nameless ...
