Printf didn't use nargs (and still doesn't).    It looked at the =
presence of the % markers and assumes that=E2=80=99s how many arguments =
were passed.
It worked on the PDP-11 or any similar stack calling sequence.   It was =
only after C got moved to some of the more varied architectures that
VARARGS/STDARG was implemented to achieve some level of variable =
argument portability.   Even so, there's not a concept of "nargs" to =
this day.

The PDP-11 nargs was a kludge that looked at the calling code.   This =
obviously didn't work if you were in split I-D mode (where you couldn't =
address the
i-space).    There was a published hack to rewire the processor to allow =
MTPI to work in user mode from your OWN I space to make it work.

The bigger issue with the early printf is it just called putchar and =
putchar only output to stdout or what ever the global fout variable was =
set to.
There was a comment in the manual that the fout concept was kludgy.

It wouldn't've used that awful nargs() call at that time, would it?  I =
was glad when that horror was removed.
