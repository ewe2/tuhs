Correct.  When void came into C, full typing was already there; so void * was a part and it was first exploited because of the useful property of the return.  The ptr properties became more and more important as its power was realized.    

FYI. K&R was written before V7 was released and matched the Typesetter C compiler for V6 more than the later compiler released in V7.  i.e. A slightly more mature version compiler was included in UNIX/TS which was what Bourne used as the V7 ‘project manager’ (Steve had a couple interesting stories about the later process).  By that point in time void had been added as formal type to the language. 

As since Bourne had been the driver for void it is not surprising that he picked up a version of the compiler that he thought was important.  Thus as was noted it meant the book and released compiler were not in sync.
