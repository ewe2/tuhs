Here's a list, gathered from the manuals, of stuff that Bell Labs 
may not have the right to redistribute, with some (uncertain)
attributions of origin. I did not check to see which of them appear in 
the TUHS archives; I doubt that /usr/src fully covered /bin and /usr/bin.

This list is at best a first draft. Please weigh in with corrections.
