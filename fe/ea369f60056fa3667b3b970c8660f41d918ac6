Long after we gave up using PDP-11’s for UNIX machines, I recycled them all into internet routers using my own (“Little Operating System” LOS).   We had started with Noel’s MIT gateway but he was exiled at the time to the Bahamas or something and we decided it was easier starting over with the magnitude of changes we needed to make.

Thanks for the reply. SimH has built in boot ROM code for the RK 
controller and other devices as well. So, the boot loader code isn't 
really necessary, but I like to understand the things I am reading and 
the boot loader code is presented in the set up instructions, so I 
wanted to understand them before I moved on to other areas.

I appreciate the historical perspective. Glenn Miller, that's fun.

Regards,

Will
