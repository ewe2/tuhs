Amusingly, I was a co-owner of a company called BDS (not the C complier =
people).  I knew the BDS-C people existed having been a customer for a =
while.
I got the BDS.COM <http://bds.com/> domain early on.    We promptly =
changed our name after an acquisition, and I let the Bds people have our =
old domain for nothing when they inquired if we were done with it.
