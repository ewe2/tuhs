Subject: [TUHS] SVR4-MP "ps -z" and "ps -Z"
Message-ID: <1083706031.951.182.camel@cube>

I'm seeking info about the SVR4-MP ps options
-z and -Z, as used for mandatory access control.
This is so that they can be implemented for Linux.

Alternately, are there more-common ways to handle
this security data or more-common usage of the
-z and -Z options?

I could use some example output.

All "trusted" high-security systems are of interest.
