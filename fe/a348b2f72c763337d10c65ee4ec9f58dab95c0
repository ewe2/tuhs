Incorrect. It's documented in IEN-44, June 1978 (written shortly after the
meeting, in the same month).

talk about today. Does that mean it's not Unix they were working on?

I just specified that it was v4 (see above).

No, with properly-chosen addresses (because of the changes in address
handling), they probably would be.
