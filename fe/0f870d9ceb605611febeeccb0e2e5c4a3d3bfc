Computer History Museum curator Dag Spicer passed along a question from =
former CHM curator Alex Bochannek that I thought someone on this list =
might be able to answer. The paper "The M4 Macro Processor=E2=80=9D by =
Kernighan and Ritchie says:

> The M4 macro processor is an extension of a macro processor called M3 =
which was written by D. M. Ritchie for the AP-3 minicomputer; M3 was in =
turn based on a macro processor implemented for [B. W. Kernighan and P. =
J. Plauger, Software Tools, Addison-Wesley, Inc., 1976].=20

Alex and Dag would like to learn more about this AP-3 minicomputer =E2=80=94=
 can anyone help?=
