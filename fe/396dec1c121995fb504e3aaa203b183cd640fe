Soft updates was available in 1998.  Were you running that?

Surprised it hasn't come up already in this discussion; I've been waiting 
for someone to mention it.

There was some licensing issue with it in the early days: it was freely 
available and free to use, but McKusick wanted a chance to try to sell it 
to a commercial unix vendor as well.  But he ended up BSD-licensing it a 
couple years later.

The original README from the FreeBSD source tree:
https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/release/3.0.0/contrib/sys/softupdates/README?revision=42952&view=co


Anyway, it solved the on-disk consistency problem and boosted performance 
as well.  I enabled it on all my systems.
