/bin is also statically linked, at least on those distributions that support split / and /usr.  SunOS 4.x and 4.4BSD did this. Except for the ones that have gone to a dynamic root moving the shared libraries from /usr/lib to /lib.  Prior to the /etc -> /sbin moves, all binaries were statically linked.  Even after the move /bin and /sbin remained static, while /usr/bin and /usr/sbin were dynamic.  The needs of reliability vs space savings pushed all the binaries in /sbin and  /bin to be static.

Even after the split in more modern systems, init and sh tend to be the only binaries that are statically linked anymore.  Thankfully, most binaries are dynamic these days, which saves a ton of space on / (as a percentage of what's used).
