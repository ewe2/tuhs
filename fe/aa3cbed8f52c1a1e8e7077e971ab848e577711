I also make new shells fairly regularly, about half the time because I wan
to set some variables that I don't want to have to reset.  Then if/when I
forget which window I was in, I can check with SHLVL (at least when using
bash, which I normally don't do).  But I'm normally in & out of the
sub-shells very quickly so don't often need to check.
