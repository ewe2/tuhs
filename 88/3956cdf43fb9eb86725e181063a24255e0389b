I've written a pile of Forth code and while some people love it, I never
warmed up to it.

You've seen it if you have used the Sun boot proms, that was all Forth.

As much as I don't care for Forth, man do I wish it had become the standard
for boot proms, it might not be my cup of tea but I could make it do what
I needed it to do.  Can't say the same for UEFI, I disable that crap.
