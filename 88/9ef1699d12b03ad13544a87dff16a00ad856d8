Some *BSDs moved from such to plain C code for strlen() for

Funnily just a couple of months ago at least FreeBSD (but i think
also DragonFly BSD, a tad different) moved back, on at least
x86_64.

(I personally no longer look nor care that much, as (a) i cannot
help it anyway, (b) there are so many CPU etc. models out there.
Why try to go backward because Cyrix is so good there, use code
alignment of X for processor A and Y for processor B?  That is
just a tremendous maintenance mess, and that for free and with so
few time.  No.  Fun fact is that my one NVME disc can read/write
1.3 gigabytes per second doing "btrfs scrub", that is i think at
least four times the speed of the main memory the mentioned Cyrix
had available.)
