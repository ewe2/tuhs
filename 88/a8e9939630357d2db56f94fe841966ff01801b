I know those Nat Semi chips very well, or did at the time.  I so wanted to
love those chips, the instruction set felt like whoever did the PDP-11
did the 320xx chips.  But they couldn't produce chips without bugs and
that killed them.  It's a crying shame, I liked the instruction set
WAY better than the VAX.  The VAX seemed really messing compared to 
the PDP-11, the 320xx chips seemed clean.  Might be rose colored 
glasses but that's my memory.
