Subject: 2.9BSD:  mbuf.h
Message-ID: <199902170423.XAA24481@zippy.bernstein.com>

I'm trying to compile a 2.9BSD kernel using the distribution from the
pups archive.

"make unix" failed:
Make:  Don't know how to make /usr/include/sys/mbuf.h.  Stop.

I looked in the usr.tar from the distribution, and I don't see mbuf.h
anywhere.

Does anyone know where I can find a copy of this file?

Cheers,
entropy

	That's not _all_ your missing ;-)

	Unless you have the 1985 Seismo (or Harvard - depends where you
	got the tape from) update tape to 2.9 the networking code won't
	compile much less run.  Been there, done that.  It was a fun couple
	weeks coming to the realization that the networking code hadn't
	been fully integrated and compiled in 2.9

	I believe the 2.9-Seismo update is in the PUPS archive (should be
	on the CD but my memory isn't ECC these days ;-)).  It's a fairly
	painful upgrade process because it changes the a.out header format
	for overlaid processes (goes from 7 to 15 overlays).  If you're not
	real careful you'll have (as I did ;-)) a real mess:  can't finish
	the upgrade because the old kernel doesn't support the new overlaid
	processes but you can't build a new kernel because doing so needs
	those processes.  Something like that.  It was "interesting" ;)

Don't worry, Nicholas is trying to patch 2.9 to get it to run on a Pro. 
I'm sure he will keep us informed :-)

Speaking of the Pro, I have one and have been trying to get Venix
to run on it.  The rub is, there are two versions: one directly from
VenturCom (Venix/Pro) and one licensed through DEC (Pro/Venix).

Venix/Pro is freely available on the Internet at ftp.update.uu.se,
but Pro/Venix seems to be a little harder to find.  Pro/Venix is
much to be preferred because you can reconfigure the kernel (in
binary) to include different drivers, etc.

I've been able to acquire all the documentation and all (almost) the
disks for Pro/Venix 2.0.  A couple of the disks are apparently
unusable or missing in the set I have.

It seems to me that Pro/Venix is a potential candidate for the PUPS
archive, the snag being DEC/Compaq residual interests in it.  PUPS
covers the AT&T part, VenturCom has "given away" their part, and
DEC/Compaq is all that's left.

So:
	1) Could this be a PUPS addition, if a good copy be found?
	2) If someone has a copy, but worries about the DEC/Compaq
	   aspects, can a good copy of the disks I have be acquired?
	   (Anyone in this category might want to respond directly
	    to me instead of posting to the mailing lists.)  After
	   all a PUPS licensee is 99.999% covered, and DEC/Compaq
	   objections are probably to worry about the AT&T part,
	   which the Ancient Unix license covers...

Actually, I'm amazed I've gotten as far as I have with this, because
I've been pretty passive about finding it.  It's only taken 2 years
so far.

Interesting...I know there's a Venix 1.0 and a Venix 2.0.  I thought
they were both from Venturcom, with 1.0 being for the Pro-350 and 2.0
for the Pro-380.  I never heard of a distinction between Venix/Pro
vs. Pro/Venix.  Then again, I got into this game fairly late...I
bought my used Pro-350 around 1993 for US$100, with Venix 1.0 already
installed (also with original install media and docs).

I have the following archives of Venix-related stuff that I snagged
from the net a few years back.  If you think any of them might contain
what you're looking for, let me know and I'll give more detail about
their contents.

Sounds like fun.  Any hints on the correct upgrade path to avoid this
lossage?

Better yet, would you be willing and able to upload a disk image or
tar file of an upgraded system to the PUPS archive (or directly to me
if it's not of general interest), so I could use that as a starting
point?

Cheers,

Subject: 2.11BSD, non-split i/d issues
Sender: owner-pups at minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au
Precedence: bulk


As already mentioned in previous messages, I'm working on getting
2.9BSD onto a Pro 350.  I'm using 2.9BSD as a starting point because
it claims to support machines without split i/d.  The 350 uses the
F-11 chipset, which I have read does not support split i/d.

I would prefer to use 2.11BSD because I understand it's still actively
used, and not as buggy as 2.9.  But everything I've read about 2.11BSD
says that it needs split i/d to run.  Can anyone give me more detail
about this?  Was support for machines without split i/d removed from
the kernel, or is it just that some of the programs are too big to fit
in a single 64k segment?

My time playing with Pro's faded out before Venix 2 was available (free)
for me to try.  I've played a fair bit with Venix 1.1 on both Pro 350's
and Pro 380's.  The Venix 1 series I feel is basically V6 derived while
I understood the Venix 2 series was derived from Sys III.

About a year ago Rick Macklem that did a port to the Pro series mailed
me his "Pro stuff" which included a tape and floppies.  I've forgotten
what all is in that stash, but taking a peek at some old mail he mentions:

> The stuff I did went out on a Usenix distribution tape in about 1983/84

I had thought his set of patches were in the PUPS archive.  In fact I
see the patches under PUPS/Distributions/ucb/2.9-pro350.

Have you been able to acquire the documentation for the DECNA card?  I
think that is roughly what it is called.  The Pro Ethernet card.  A few
old timers like myself and Dan Lanciani talked years ago about running
things on a Pro and no-one seems to know much about this relatively
critical bit of documentation.  Again referring to Rick Macklem's
correspondence (I believe I was asking him, again, about these docs):

> Well, the short answer is "I'm not sure what the answers are". At one

> I have no idea how you might find him now. (It was a real dog on a Pro350

The rumors we were able to find all pointed to this place and person
WRT documentation for the ethernet card.

Those files aren't 100% complete.  Excerpt of a mail I sent last night
to Warren Toomey:

#The instructions in boot.doc are mangled.
#The patches included are reversed, and didn't apply cleanly to one of
#the files (/usr/src/net/sys/sys/machdep.c).  Also, it looks like the
#guy that produced that set of changes forgot to include his
#modifications to /usr/src/sys/conf/config, but I managed to hack
#together something that might work.

Then there's the fact that the 2.9 distribution won't even compile,
and the 2.9 upgrade patches are a nightmare...

Maybe I'll just stick to venix :-)

I haven't looked for it.  The DECNA is optional, and my Pro doesn't
have it.  All Pro's came with an AUI port, but without the card it
doesn't do anything.

I haven't tried the 2.9 stuff at all on a Pro.  I have had it
running on an 11/23+ (w/binary license) for 10 years.  The
problem is the networking, as you have found.

Venix/Pro 1.1 and 2.0 run just fine on the Pro 380, and it's
pretty painless to install.  I have distribution disks for
Pro/Venix 1.1, but the install disk has apparently been
overwritten with the 2.0 installation disk.  And my distribution
for 2.0 is missing a couple of original disks; I have copies of
those disks, but they get read errors.

I guess the 2.9 stuff would be interesting if you got it to
work on the Pro, especially if you got networking to work.
I don't have any docs on the DECNA, but they must exist.  It's
probably pretty close to the DEQNA.

Hi

	Oh, it's not _completely_ irrecoverable and is "fun" in a perverse
	way.

	First go thru all of the executable directories (/bin, /usr/bin,...)
	and identify all of the overlaid executables and save copies of them.
	Shouldn't be too many but the important one is 'ex'/'vi'.  A number
	of programs rely on using 'ex' scripts to edit generated files (the
	kernel makefiles are _good_ examples;)), and so on.  Having an older
	copy of 'ex'/'vi' is the main thing I remember as saving the day.

> Better yet, would you be willing and able to upload a disk image or

	Oh, I have no 2.9 systems - this was all done 10 years ago.  The
	systems I run now use MSCP/TMSCP devices and 2.9 lacks support
	for those.

	Oh, support was NOT removed.  Non-split executables (magic number
	0407 and 0410) will still run.  

	The kernel will not fit - without split I/D it is impossible to
	create a /unix image that fits within a single 64kb (actually 48kb
	since the kernel stack takes 1 segment and the 'u' area takes
	another) address space.

	I actually went thru the exercise once (2.10 era) of creating a bare 
	bones kernel that would fit in - at least the linker said it would.
	That was only done by ripping out lots of stuff - no networking, no
	statistics gathering, almost no drivers, etc.  Never 'ran' it though
	since there seemed to be little point in such a stripped down system.

	Even V7 was hard pressed to run on a non-split machine!  In fact there
	was a paper written about shoehorning V7 onto an 11/40 and the hoops
	that needed to be jumped thru.  Not sure but that document might be
	in the /usr/doc tree of one of the PUPS Distributions hierarchy.
