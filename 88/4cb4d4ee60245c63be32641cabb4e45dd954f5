​Exactly....​

IIRC this is part of the argument Dykstra made with the THE paper years
ago, Parnas in his information hiding paper -- i.e. why microkernels and
proper layering are a good idea.   Keep is simple and do one thing
well/protect yourself against other subsystems not being 100%.  Linux and
Winders are are bad a the processor.

​Yup microkernels are a tad slower and have more overhead, and might
(probably will) cost a little more.   But I really do think simplicity
beats complexity and I'll pay a bit in over head to keep it simple.

The problem of course for my employers over the years, is that many  people
(most
​people ​
probably)
​ ​
do not think me
​ and follow their wallet on the fastest for the cheapest​
