As an Emacs user, obviously I disagree :P

How many keystrokes are needed to do a given edit with Emacs versus vi,
and in particular such an artificially frozen version of vi?

This is not just laziness (though as we know laziness is a virtue in
programmers).  It's a health issue with RSI.

And I disagree with restrictions on shell tools as well.  They may
have made for a uniform predictable environment on one project and one
job.  But what if an engineer moved on?  Do you really expect him to
reinvent the wheel all over again everytime?

As an example of the level of tool I mean: today I decided I had to stop
using the perl-rename program in my scripts, because different
distributions install it under different names.  It is very painful to
do this: there is no such tool in basic Unix.  Of course I can hack my
own in maybe 10-15 lines of shell code, but that is exactly the kind of
thing you would prohibit.
