I can fit 115x38 in my standard text editor on a 1280x1024 display and 
although I often write to the size of the window, I still consider 80 
columns, or more correctly *79* columns, the limit that my lines should 
not exceed for hysterical reasons (and when I used EDIT in MS-DOS, this 
limit was usually 77 but I walked over it all the time).
