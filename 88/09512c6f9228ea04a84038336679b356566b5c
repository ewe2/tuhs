Twenty years is pretty much when USL got out of the UNIX biz entirely.   System V actually started thirty years ago or so.   I worked on System V over BSD project with Doug Gwyn when still at BRL and I left there in 1987.   Amusingly, I continued to find copies of the "Ron" shell kicking around for decades after that.
