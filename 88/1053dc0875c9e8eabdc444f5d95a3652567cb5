These were the numbers that I could find in contemporary documentation. 5th
and 6th edition didn't have a number like the manuals up to the 4th
edition. I got the 7th edition from somewhere I don't recall, but as the
6th and 7th editions were widely licensed and started having lots of users
based on ports that happened, it can be hard to put numbers down.
