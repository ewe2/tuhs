Subject: [TUHS] Multiple system call sets
Message-ID: <wqz1xkwiqyf.wl@hurt.theclones.net>


Folks,

I am interested in the use of multiple system call sets in Unix systems.
I recollect that Pyramid Technology machines in the 80's allowed users
and/or processes to select whether to use BSD or SYSV system call
semantics.  Also, FreeBSD supports Linux system calls and SYSV in
emulation.

Does anyone know a good location (book, article, website) that discusses
this.

thanks
dayton
