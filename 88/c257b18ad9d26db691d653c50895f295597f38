Ouch!  Doing it half way across the US was bad enough.  I'd hate to 
experience half way around the world.

(Don't forget the -Y to forward authentication. ;-)

I completely agree.

Also, I believe that graphic console has a completely different security 
exposure compared to allowing someone to use X remotely.  (Via ssh 
forwarding or more traditionally across the network.)

I actually ended up going the other way.  X11 is nice when it works. 
However, I found that I spent a LOT of time waiting on X11 to chat back 
and forth.  Comparatively VNC is (IMHO) a lot better at lower bandwidth 
and / or higher latency.

Also, running Xvnc (server) on the remote system allows you to 
(dis)connect the VNC client at will.  Same advantages as screen / tmux, 
but for X11.

I personally look fondly on the days when you could set the DISPLAY 
variable and launch your GUI application.
