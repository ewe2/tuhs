Well, those are surprising responses for me anyway I guess.

Here's the thing about special files. They have an integer 'x' attached to
them which basically means "this file represents an index into an internal
kernel struct'.

Now if you are comfortable with the idea that a file, with a number
attached to its metadata, said number representing an index into an array
of structs, which has to work for all time and all kernels: then we're just
comfortable with different things. 'nuf said.

moving right along, when did /dev first appear?
