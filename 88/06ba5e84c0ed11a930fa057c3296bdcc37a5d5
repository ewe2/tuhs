No, but at least it didn’t glow when I turned the lights off.    I was living in Denver at the time.   I can’t believe I paid to have that thing shipped back to Maryland when I took the job at BRL.

Hopkins had a KSR37 that was our standard word processing output for a long time before the daisy wheel printers started showing up.
It even had the "greek box" so when eqn or whatever wanted that, it just sent shift-in/shift-out (control-n, -o).     Years later I managed to pick up a surplus ASR37 from Rocky Flats.    I had it in my kitchen for years on a modem.    It was great fun to have one of the few terminals that nroff would send all those ESC-8/9 things for the vertical positioning without needing an output filter.    No greek box, though.   It also had a giant NEWLINE key and didn't need to have the nl mode turned on.   Amusingly the thing would sit there quiet until the modem was powered up and then DSR ready would bring it to life.    When CD came up an giant green PROCEED light illuminated above the keyboard.   The paper tape unit was a monster side car.   I never got around to programming the "here-is" drum.

I think RS took it and left it behind someone's car at one as a practical joke.
