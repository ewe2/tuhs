Would you be so kind to explain a bit about the hm version of MH.


Ten years ago I wanted to improve nmh, because I found it bad that it took
me months to configure it in so many ways to get it usable for modern
emailing. Even at that point I hadn't found some of its cool features, whic=
h
all were deactivated by default. I argued but couldn't convince the nmh
community. Later I used my master's thesis as the opportunity to create an
experimental version of nmh, to convince by demonstration.

Have a look at my master's thesis, if you like:
	http://marmaro.de/docs/master/

Actually it became a fork, now named mmh. The project's still active.
Especially Philipp Takacs has done a lot, among that replacing m_getfld(),
a highly optimized mail reading function. See the pre-mmh version of it
for an entertaining read:
	http://git.marmaro.de/?p=3Dmmh;a=3Dblob;f=3Ddocs/m_getfld.c.humor;h=3D4644=
9095d

This is our replacement:
	http://git.marmaro.de/?p=3Dmmh;a=3Dblob;f=3Dsbr/m_getfld2.c;h=3Db9a618d16



I'm much interested in any MH background. Shockingly I cannot recall having
read about hm before ...
