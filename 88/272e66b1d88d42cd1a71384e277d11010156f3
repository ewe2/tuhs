That's the wrong question.  On my laptop right now Emacs seems to be about 37M after running for a while but not weeks (total VM I think). The mail client I am writing this with is 118M (and some helpers apparently which might push it closer to 150).  The reminders application is 90.  The application I'm using to get these numbers is using more memory than Emacs.

Emacs was a very big application, once, but in terms of feature/byte it is now an extremely svelte thing compared with the bloated horrors that we use all the time.

(Non-GUI emacs is 6).
