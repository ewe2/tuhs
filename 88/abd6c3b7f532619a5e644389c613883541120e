I sent out the 2.11 tapes at one point.  We just shipped out whatever we 
had in the latest package build.  No version control. So I wouldn't call 
them patches, more like new subversions.

So the question might be, does anyone have a really old 2.11 tape? It 
would have to be from around 1980.  I did not save a 2.11 in my collection.
