Yes, I'd be interested.  Other than the renames I think we can automate
most of this.

Thanks.  One day we'll get around to adding sub line highlighting - that 
would be an improvement.

Both biased and incorrect.  There are over 10,000 branches of the linux
kernel floating around in BitKeeper (we know, we counted them) and we 
handle file movement much more nicely than perforce does (we have our
own concept of an inode, a pathname is a attribute of an inode just
like contents are an attribute of the inode - so you can move A to B,
I modify A, you pull from me and the changes apply to B in your tree.)

You can be as biased as you want, I don't want to turn this into a 
SCM discussion, but try and be accurate.  About the only thing that 
p4 does that we don't do is centralized locking; we don't need to
do that in a distributed/replicated system but people sometimes want it.
