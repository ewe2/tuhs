The problem being that even FreeBSD dropped them from the base
system.  I think only NetBSD still ships with it.  And Linux never
had that stuff anyway, only thanks to the dedicated Linux
man-pages project it is that you have anything usable at all (when
not sticking with the GLibC info manual).  I do not want to be
back in 1999 when i desperately searched for just about anything
but copyright notices in /usr/share/doc (or /usr/doc, i forgot),
and that should be /usr/share/copyrights still for most of the
things.
