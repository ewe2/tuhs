I put a certain amount of time last decade at a community centre's cybercaf in Christchurch, NZ, into 
teaching elderly people who have not previously had much experience with computers, how to use 
them. You do get a buzz when someone who's previously been full of questions, suddenly "gets it" and 
their eyes light up and no more questions, let's get things done!

It's not dissimilar to the buzz you get when you enter some code and it does what you think it should, 
not something else.

Just my 0.02c
