We lost software engineer Dick Hustvedt on this day in 2008, following 
severe injuries in a vehicle accident.  He contributed much to RSX-11 and 
VMS, including the infamous "microfortnight" and the SD730 Fixed Head 
Solar Horologue.  An obituary of him can be found at 
http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2008/04/23/dick-hustvedt-the-consummate-software-engineer/ 
(and it's worth reading).
