I have long told people trying to learn unix "Most people don't learn 
from man pages.  Man pages are great reference after you know (some of) 
<bla>."

I typically refer someone to online tutorials or start an in person / 
email discussion with them about what they are trying to learn.  Usually 
I try to tailor it to and / or reference things that I'm aware they are 
familiar with.
