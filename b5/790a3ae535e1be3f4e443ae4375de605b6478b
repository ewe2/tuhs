The misc/KE.diff file does not work with patch.  I get this:

/opt/simh$ patch --dry-run --verbose <../unix72/misc/KE.diff
Hmm...  Looks like a unified diff to me...
The text leading up to this was:

Patching file makefile using Plan A...

Hmm...  The next patch looks like a unified diff to me...
can't find file to patch at input line 15
