It amazes and annoys me to this day how many PDFs purported to be "electronic documents" are merely pictures of paper. Not only am I missing my 2000's-era personal jetpack, I'm still waiting for my fully paperless office.

Though given the incredible state of computer security, perhaps that's a good thing.
