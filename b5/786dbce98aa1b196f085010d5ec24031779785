​teklabs 11/70 the RS04 was /tmp    not quite an dangerous as root, but
since the fs got wiped out the system would not boot - as it would fail
trying to mount /tmp.

IIRC the it was the field exerciser that did that by default.   I seem to
remember that you could configure it to use something else like the field
service pack itself or may be not disk at all, but if I remember right if
the exerciser found an RS04 it thought it was available by default.   So, I
had a big sticker on the FS pack that said see me before you loaded it
after the first time the service guys took out /tmp.
