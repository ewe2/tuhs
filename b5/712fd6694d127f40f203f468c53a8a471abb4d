Alcatel-Lucent gave an official grant to V8, V9 and V10. See
https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dan_Cross_v8/statement_=
regarding_Unix_3-7-17.pdf
which reads:

Statement Regarding Research Unix Editions 8, 9, and 10 Alcatel-Lucent USA
Inc. (=E2=80=9CALU-USA=E2=80=9D), on behalf of itself and Nokia Bell Labora=
tories agrees,
to the extent of its ability to do so, that it will not assert its
copyright rights with respect to any non-commercial copying, distribution,
performance, display or creation of derivative works of Research Unix=C2=AE
Editions 8, 9, and 10. The foregoing does not (i) transfer ownership of, or
relinquish any, intellectual property rights (including patent rights) of
Nokia Corporation, ALU-USA or any of their affiliates, (ii) grant a license
to any patent, patent application, or trademark of Nokia Corporation,
ALU-USA. or any of their affiliates, (iii) grant any third-party rights or
licenses, or (iv) grant any rights for commercial purposes. Neither
ALU-USA. nor Nokia Bell Laboratories will furnish or provided support for
Research Unix Editions 8, 9, and 10, and make no warranties or
representations hereunder, including but not limited to any warranty or
representation that Research Unix Editions 8, 9, and 10 does not infringe
any third party intellectual property rights or that Research Unix Editions
8, 9, and 10 is fit for any particular purpose.

So not exactly the sweeping "We own this and you can do whatever w/o
restriction" license one would like, but still much better than "in the
wild and unchallenged"...

Caldera did those about 10 years prior to V8-V10 being available.

https://9p.io/plan9/about.html has details on plan9, but the latest
versions are available under the MIT license.
