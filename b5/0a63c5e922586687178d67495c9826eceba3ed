Several sources agree that it was, and speak of a menu shell.

<http://www.vintage-computer.com/dec_pro_350.shtml> claims that
RT-11 ran: whether stock or modified, the page doesn't say.  This
is confirmed by a squib in InfoWorld 6:23 (June 4, 1984) on p. 84
<http://books.google.com/books?id=vi4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA84>, which also
speaks of a V7 derivative called VII-M.  Venix 2.0 (aka System III) was
definitely available.
