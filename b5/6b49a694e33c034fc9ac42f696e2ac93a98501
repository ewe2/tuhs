Another one i would be interested to know more of.

whilst at college i used an inter data 3210 running edition 7, which was version 7 with bits of 2.1 bsd (very much from memory).

there was an editor on that machine i have never seen or heard of since - le.  it was a visual editor, and i think supported multiple windows, of termcap style.

anyone know more?
