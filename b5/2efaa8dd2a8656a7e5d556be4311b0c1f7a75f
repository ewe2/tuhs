V7 indeed did not have "#" as a comment. Programs use the ":" command for t=
hat, and was careful of what was in the comment. The ":" command was called=
 SYSNULL in the source.=20
    Later versions of Steve's shell had COMCHAR defined to be a "#" and tes=
ted for that symbol in word(), eating up all the characters until it got to=
 a newline. The version of Seventh Edition I used to carry around and embed=
 in things had that mod. My original Seventh did not.
