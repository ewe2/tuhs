I&#39;ve been trying to set up UUCP on my V7 system and its raspberry Pi ho=

This plus the &quot;s&quot; editor (already working) are really all that&#3=

was write text files (which in some sense is all my job _is_, but to be<br>
fair I get a much more immediate feedback loop in my current environment).<=
br>
<br>
I was following<br>

more or less--I had already rebuilt v7 with the DZ terminal driver and was<=
br>
using it for interactive sessions (albeit, before I started trying to get<b=

UUCP running, with 7-bit line discipline--but I&#39;ve since changed that).=
<br>

I have 16 DZ lines, I&#39;ve set them to 8-bit mode.=C2=A0 They&#39;re work=

<br>
I&#39;ve built UUCP, set a node name, and set it up on the pi.<br>
<br>
I can execute uucico to send files, and it, frustratingly, almost works.<br=

<br>
&gt;From the Pi side, I see (with uulog):<br>
<br>

<br>
uulog -x on the v7 side has no output, and nothing ever appears in the<br>
spool directory, which I suspect is a direct result of the timeout waiting<=
br>
for packet.<br>
<br>
So my question is, what else do I do to debug this?=C2=A0 Clearly the pi (T=
aylor<br>
UUCP) side is expecting something else--maybe an acknowledgement?--from the=
<br>
v7 side to let it know the transmission was successful.<br>
<br>
Any help would be appreciated.<br>
