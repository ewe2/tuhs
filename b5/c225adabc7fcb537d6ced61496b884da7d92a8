"When I was managing SunOS systems it seemed like everyone rolled their
own..."

Yep, IIRC, tarball or cpio tape, no tracking or update support. Lucky if
the ISV install script asked where to install it.


SunOS filesystem layout was thoughtfully designed though, when diskless &
diskfull systems were introduced supporting multiple architectures (2.5?
3.x?): CPU-architecture-specific and architecture-independent mount points,
directories for Sun, ISV and local apps, etc (/usr /opt /usr/local and
their variations), read-only /usr support (link writeables into /var).

Though, mostly just Sun used this flexibility/complexity, few ISVs: they
generally wanted their installs to be consistent across HP-UX, MIPS
RISC/os, Pyramid dualPort DC/OSx, Sequent (Dynix?), SunOS, (maybe-AIX??,)
etc; which made sense from a support training point of view.


Beyond ./configure; make; make install which I'd count as build but barely
packaging, I don't recall any packaging until Solaris pkgadd et al?

Unfortunately with pkgadd came patchadd & friends.
They did their level best to cross-patch random binaries and muddy the
patch/package interdependency-waters as much as humanly possible.

Partly as a result, the early OS/patch/firmware support matrices for
FibreChannel were horrible.
I'll probably have nightmares about that tonight...
