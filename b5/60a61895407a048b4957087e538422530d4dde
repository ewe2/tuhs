I totally agree.  My question is about language use (or drift) - nothing 
else.  In Scotland - amongst the young -  "Arithmetic" is now referred 
to as "Maths".   I am aware of the transition but cant understand what 
caused it to happen!  I dont know if other countries had/have the same 
slide from a specific to a general - hence the questions - nothing deeper.

In lower secondary school we would go to both Arithmetic AND also to 
Maths classes.  I suspect that no longer happens in the schools.  I 
guess I will need to go speak to some teachers.

I am not nit-picking, this is just the first time I have picked up the 
use of maths in the context amongst eh how do I phrase it "the older 
generation" oops....
