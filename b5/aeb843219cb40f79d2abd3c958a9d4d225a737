Yep, and they ran like the clappers; I can still remember its "moose
call" when it was syncing with the other end.

Ah, well I remember the time back at Strangled Tangled and Confused, when 
we were being chipped by the accountoids for our long-distance modem 
bills; when I explained to the suits that they were actually our head 
office (bug reports and resolution etc), a couple of Trailblazers suddenly 
appeared in our respective machine rooms.
