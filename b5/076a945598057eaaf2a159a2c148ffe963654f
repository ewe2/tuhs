Always there! (My favorite is NetBSD which derived from BSD which 
originally derived from 32V and before that as enhancements and patches 
against v4 through v6.)

v1 has the concept
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V1/man/man7/login.7
but I don't find the code for it.

v2 has it
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V2/cmd/login.s

(By the way, where is the shell code referenced in init.s for the 
earlier Unix?
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=PDP7-Unix )
