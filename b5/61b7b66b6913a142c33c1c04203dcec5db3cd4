Subject: [TUHS] A Talk on Early Unix
Message-ID: <20160630065609.GA20869@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, I was invited to give a talk at a symposium in Paris
on the early years of Unix. Slides and recording at:
http://minnie.tuhs.org/Z3/Hapop3/

Feel free to point out the inaccuracies :-)
For example, I thought Unix was used at some point
as the OS for some of the ESS switches in AT&T, but
now I think I was mistaken.

That's a temp URL, it will move somewhere else
eventually.

Cheers, Warren
