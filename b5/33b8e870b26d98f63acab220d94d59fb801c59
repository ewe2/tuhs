I ported Xinu to a Motorola 68000 on VME card. I had the luxury of a
working C compiler, so there was very little assembly language required
(context switch only, from memory). The main effort was in rewriting device
drivers for the relevant hardware. The result was used for teaching
Operating Systems.

Unfortunately, I no longer have the code.
