The V8 tape has the Blit stuff in /usr/blit, and the 5620 stuff
in /usr/jerq.  The Blit stuff looks somewhat older, and doesn't
have exactly the same graphics library functions as the 5620.

It would be interesting to see a chronology of the evolution of
these window systems.

That's amusing, considering that the 5620 stuff was in /usr/jerq on
Research systems!  Apparently the accident became institutionalized.
