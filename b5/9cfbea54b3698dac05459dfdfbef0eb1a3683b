Subject: [TUHS] 4.3 BSD under SIMH's 11/780 emulator
Message-ID: <46b366130903240934s3e679aebnfacf0af9977b75bf@mail.gmail.com>

if anyone is interested, I noticed that if you remove the error
checking form the recv portion of the if_de driver it seems to work
for 4.3 BSD & variants...   As far as I know there is no if_de for 4.2
BSD... But then if there were you would still have it's
incompatibility problems...

Anyways, here is a diff from 4.3 BSD

I have set it up with my SLiRP patch, and I had it pinging away at
10.0.2.2 for 5 hours, 100% success, and I had no issues TELNETTing
into the VM..I think that BSD see's the crc32 on the end and treats
all inbound packets as bad, dropping them all.. so I just quickly
sidestepped the error check..  I would imagine this would work with
SIMH's libpcap support so you can now get your virtual 11/780 onto the
Internet, and party like it's 1986!

For any windows users out there, I'll package up 4.3 BSD & the
Wisconsin version up onto sourceforge...
