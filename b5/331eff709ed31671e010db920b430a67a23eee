Yeah, MIT (or was it Proteon, I forget - a long time ago :-) had that theme
going for a while for printers...

Hah! I do have a cosmically great computer naming story from DEC, though.

So DECNet host names were limited to N characters (where N=8, or some
such). So one day they get this complaint from some DEC user in the UK:

"Grumble, grumble, grumble, N-character limit in DECNet host names, we want to
name our host 'Slartibartfast'."

So, this being before a certain radio play had hit the US from the UK, the
people at DEC were like:

"What's a 'Slartibartfast'???"

Instantly, the reply shot back (and perhaps some of you saw this coming):

"Boy, you guys are so unhip it's a wonder your pants down fall down!" :-) :-)
