There were. On 23 March 2002 Martin Crehan started a thread on this  
list, including a cite to this Slashdot posting: http://slashdot.org/ 
comments.pl?sid=29920&cid=3213453

I would link to the thread, but the search seems broken (http:// 
minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/pups.cgi).

Apart from the PDP-11 version mentioned there, I am also aware of the  
Lisa XENIX port (68K).
