To fill out the historical record, the earliest doctype I know of
was a shell (not rc) script.  From my basement heater that happens
to run 10/e:

b$ man doctype | uniq

     DOCTYPE(1)                                             DOCTYPE(1)

     NAME
          doctype - guess command line for formatting a document

     SYNOPSIS
          doctype [ option ... ] [ file ]

     DESCRIPTION
          Doctype guesses and prints on the standard output the com-
          mand line for printing a document that uses troff(1),
          related preprocessors like eqn(1), and the ms(6) and mm
          macro packages.

          Option -n invokes nroff instead of troff. Other options are
          passed to troff.

     EXAMPLES
          eval `doctype chapter.?` | apsend
               Typeset files named chapter.0, chapter.1, ...

     SEE ALSO
          troff(1), eqn(1), tbl(1), refer(1), prefer(1), pic(1),
          ideal(1), grap(1), ped(9.1), mcs(6), ms(6), man(6)

     BUGS
          It's pretty dumb about guessing the proper macro package.

doctype(1) is in the 8/e manual, so it existed in early 1985;
I bet it's actually older than that.  The manual page is on
the V8 tape, but, oddly, not the program; neither is it in
the V10 pseudo-tape I cobbled together for Warren long ago.
I'm not sure why not.

The version in rc is, of course, a B-movie remake of the
original.
