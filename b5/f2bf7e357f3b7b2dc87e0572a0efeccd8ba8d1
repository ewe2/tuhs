> Is the value of ecore arbitrary? What's above ecore, the kernel stack?

ecore should be the top of memory on a 24k machine.  If you add more
RAM, you could raise ecore, but you'd have to adjust a bunch of things
    - each process has storage on rf0 allocated for it to swap to
    - the core dump dumps out 8k of memory
and probably others.
