That reminds me of the multicharacter constant vs 'byte' index used in speak.c, I didn't realize this was an intended 'feature' for faking tuples (and allowing to index by either the first or second element) in early C, it seemed a bit of a hack to me.
I was hoping there was some elegant way to achieve nearly the same thing in modern C, but I didn't find anything obvious short of string comparisons and an array with a byte and a pointer to a string.

That turned out to be the wrong paper.

I'm looking for a paper that describes the (early) dialect of C that let you do stuff like this:

struct w {
char lo, hi;
};

int x;

char b = x.lo;

I can't find my hardcopy so was looking for a pdf.

More generally, just replace "cm.bell-labs.com<http://cm.bell-labs.com>" with "9p.io<http://9p.io>".
