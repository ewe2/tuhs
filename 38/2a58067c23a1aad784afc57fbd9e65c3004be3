That's exactly what I thought I did in the bochs config.

     floppya: 1_44=d1, status=inserted
     boot: floppy

The bochs floppy drive and the Coherent #1 disk never wanted to dance.
The last time I tried before was with bochs-2.4.2 and with bochs-2.6.7
I still get the dreaded <Door Open> message.

If you know the magic incantation to get it past that in bochs, please
let me know.

Meanwhile it installs and seems to run like a charm in qemu-2.2.0.
