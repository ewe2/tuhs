You may have been lucky not to need the backup images.  My experience
with ROLLIN/ROLLOUT early on was that DEC software used only 200 of
the 203 tracks available on a RK05.   Unix on the other hand also used
the 3 spare tracks.  4872 whole blocks.  So ROLLIN backups of a Unix
RK05 did not always have everything on them.
