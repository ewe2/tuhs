grep is the best-known case of the regular-expression code being extracted
from ed for use elsewhere. Another case is the regex library, created by
me, for use in some PWB code we were working on, probably around 1974. My
recollection is that the code was in assembler, as I think ed remained in
assembler long after UNIX itself went to C. I wrapped it for calling from
C, of course... we didn't code in assembler.
