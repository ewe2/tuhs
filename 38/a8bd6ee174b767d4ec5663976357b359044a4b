The MIT ~PWB1 system had a thing called 'dpy', I think written at MIT based on
'ps' (and no doubt inspired by ITS' PEEK), which had similar functionality.
Seems like it never escaped, though. Man page and source here:

  http://ana-3.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/tech/unix/man1/dpy.1
  http://ana-3.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/tech/unix/s1/dpy.c

The top of my hard-copy man page says 'November 1977', but I suspect it dates
back further than that.
