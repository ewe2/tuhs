fs/Readme now contains the correct file permissions for the files on the
V1 filesystem images. mkfs.c now reads this file and uses it as required.
tools/imgbuild builds rf0.dsk and rk0.dsk, using the fs/ files. I decided
to turn off the "world write" flag on all the files: I can't see why any
files should be world writable.

Unfortunately, I had to use rsync in tools/imgbuild so that I could
stop the .svn/ directories being copied into the images. Let me know if
that is OK, or if we can do it without rsync.

Cheers,
	Warren
