AT&T 3B20 - *0 didn't segfault but brought in some weird value.

Pyramid Dual Universe - System V vs. BSD - why be forced to decide when
you can have your cake and eat it too?

Whatever Data General called their Unix layer on top of their native
OS for the Eclipse or whatever it was (32 bit system).

Eunice - we had it one place I worked but I didn't use it much.

I never got to work on more exotic systems such as Interdata
or Series 1.
