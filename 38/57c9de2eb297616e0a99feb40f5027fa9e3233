PWB was great too, but what was most useful to me was the 
"UNIX programmer's manual" from Bell Telephone Laboratories (c) 1979, 1983 


The first volume included all the man pages, a quick reference, and an index. 


The second volume contained all the "how to" guides, including concise summaries 
of the facilities available on UNIX, the original UNIX paper from Ritchie and Thompson, 
UNIX for Beginners from Kernighan, NROFF/TROFF User's Manual, TROFF Tutorial, 
C Programming Language, Lint, Make, YACC, LEX, AWK, and on and on. 


The combination of those two volumes was invaluable.
