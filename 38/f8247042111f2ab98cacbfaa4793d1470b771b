Thanks :) - I'm basing this on Oracle database performance, for the most 
part, and it's weird way of supporting NUMA on Linux in a bass-ackwards 
sort of way. Nothing I see in the latest RedHat/CentOS tells me it even 
cares about NUMA, but maybe that's more of their "we know better than 
you" mentality and it's all hidden under the covers somewhere.
