Subject: New PDF version of Installing and Using Research Unix Version 7 In
 the SimH PDP-11/45 and 11/70 Emulators
Message-ID: <00712ca5-edd5-c198-4628-4bcd71669a64@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I just finished creating an updated PDF version of a blog post I did a 
couple of years back, describing how to install and use Unix v7 in SimH. 
It's updated for 2017 and MacOS High Sierra 10.13. I started the update 
because I was wanting to do some research in v7 and thought it would be 
good to have a current set of instructions but really because I was 
interested in learning a bit about LaTeX and creating prettier, more 
useful documents. The notes still work fine as originally written, but I 
organized things a little differently and tweaked some of the language. 
I thought somebody else might like having a PDF version around so I 
uploaded the result, call it revision 1.1, and made it publicly 
accessible (the blog still needs updating, somebody oughta do something 
about link impermanence, but that's all for another day). Feel free to 
comment or complain. I added a section in honor of dmr at one 
commenter's suggestion. Here's the link:
