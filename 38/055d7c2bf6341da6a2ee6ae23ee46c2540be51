Subject: Modified Supnik emulator for the 11
Message-ID: <199908252113.OAA15059@mrynet.com>

Hi folks.

Having had absolutely no luck getting the Begemot emulator
to work under FreeBSD 4.0-CURRENT, I've been modifying the 
Supnik 2.3d emulator for the pdp-11.

So far, I've replaced the KL11 code with a DL11 driver that
handles four lines.  Additionally, I stole the networked
tty_net driver from the begemot which now provides telnet
access to all four ports.  Additionally, I'm working on a
DZ-11 driver as-we-speak, and will do the DEQNA next.
These four ports work great on the RSTS/E and 2.11 images
I have.

As well, I've tweaked the clock timing to significantly
improve timekeeping for my machine.

Also, I have been modifying an ANSI magtape util package
(ansir/ansiw/survey) to deal with the mt images that the
supnik package produces.  Makes for easy exchange into
RSTS, etc.

Is anyone else out the hacking it up and interested in sharing
any work?

And if anyone has managed to get the Begemot emulator
working on recent FreeBSD-4.0-CURRENT versions, I'd be
grateful if you could share the information and changes with me.

Thanks and regards,

Really!  So far I have had no luck getting Supnik 2.3 to work with the 
elfje rl02 images on the PUPS archive.  I've always had to use the
significantly-hacked-up 2.2 emulator instead.  What did you change
and/or what disk images are you using?

I would love to find an arrangement that makes it possible to run an
emulated 2.11bsd system with large-capacity RP06 images.. that would
allow one to have around a quarter-gig of disk space. :)

	Hmmm, the Begemot emulator is difficult to set up due to an
	inscrutable configfile format but it runs here under BSD/OS 4.0.1
	after making a couple 'tweeks'.

	I wonder if the problems you're having are due to FreeBSD switching
	to ELF.  At one time BSD/OS used a.out also and "P11" built/ran
	just fine - the the OS switched to ELF and P11 would no longer build.
	I had thought simply editing the instab.s would be enough but after
	doing that P11 wouldn't run right at all.

	What I did was add a "-u" option to 'geni' and then regenerate the
	instab.s file ("geni -u ...") _without_ the underscore characters
	present.  The compiler no longer generates leading '_' characters so
	having them in the instab.s file causes problems.  Regenerating 
	and assembling instab.s cleared up all the problems I was having.

	Below are the changes I've made to P11 - some are specific to getting
	the various IOprogs to run under BSD/OS but the changes to geni.c
	are OS independent.

	THe other change I had to make was to 'devices.c' to speed up the
	clock - it's still not right for a PPro-200 but is better than it
	was (the clock was running far too slow, now it's just ~10% too slow).

> And if anyone has managed to get the Begemot emulator

	Not FreeBSD but if you're getting bit by the same thing I did earlier
	under another BSD that switched from a.out to ELF the changes below
	may be useful to you.

	Hmm, I've been using Supnik's 2.3 emulator (on and off - I prefer
	running the real 11/73 though most of the time) and now that "vi"
	works (there was a bug in the "div" instruction which Bob fixed not
	all that long ago for 2.3) the emulator's more useful than it was.

> significantly-hacked-up 2.2 emulator instead.  What did you change

	You might try using the 2.11 images from the PUPS CD instead.  Create
	a "tape file" (the instructions are in the 2.11 distribution directory)
	and then use a "toggle in" bootstrap for the "mt" device.  

	The config file I use for this is:

set cpu 22B
set cpu 2048K
set rp0 rp06
set rl0 rl02
set rl1 rl02
set rl2 rl02
set rl3 rl02
set tm0 locked
at rp0 rp0
at rl0 root.rl02
at rl1 usr1.rl02
at rl2 usr2.rl02
at rl3 usr3.rl02
at rk0 junk0.rk05

at rk3 junk3.rk05
at rk4 junk4.rk05
at rk5 junk5.rk05
at rk6 junk6.rk05
at rk7 junk7.rk05
at tm0 mt0
at tm1 mt1
# at tm1 /zip/mt0

	Place your "2.11 boot tape file" (the 'makesimtape' program which is
	also available in the archive and on the CD is used to create Supnik
	emulator tape files) in to the file "mt0" and then follow the
	instructions in the setup/install documentation on how to boot a tape
	if you don't have tape bootroms (it's less than a dozen instructions
	you need to toggle in the octal for).


	Oh - and since the "RP06" disk is just an image to the host computer
	(to the PDP-11 it is a RP06 ;)) the  image IS interchangeable between
	emulators - I've used the same RP06 image under both (obviously not
	at the same time) the Supnik and Begemot emulators.  Works fine.

	The biggest problem with the Supnik emulator is that the clock runs
	far far too fast (at least with a PPro-200 running the emulator) and
	after running for an extended period of time the PDP-11 system ends
	up several hours in the future.

That's correct. I believe there are also problems with p11 missing
a couple of timer interrupts. All of the complaints are entirely
appropriate, the whole thing needs major cleanup. I hope one of us
will finally get around doing some serious work on it again, soon.

I've changed nothing at all really as far as 2.11 goes.  Worked just 
dandy even before my hacking.

The complexities of begemot, and the relative ease of use of Supnik
was the driving force behind my sticking it out with Supnik.   I figured
I'd make it do what I want, since I could make it work in the first place.
Since I'm into the actual hardware emulation, as well as device drivers,
it is fulfilling my need here until I ever get a real PDP-11 again.

The same similar tweak on Supnik has me to within seconds on the hour.  They're
all gonna start losing it under load anyways, but that's life when running
an emulator under non-RT ;)

Actually, I had resolved issue of linking and the prepended underscores before.  
The compile has always been clean, but the program simply doesn't work.
For example, run with -b from the command line, it returns the shell prompt
almost immediately.  Otherwise, when booting it simply indicates:
	DCOK = 1 asserted
and goes back to the emulator prompt.
That happens regardless of disk image used, etc... I can't effect anything
other than these exhibitions.

Perhaps somewith with access to 4.0-CURRENT, and who has worked with the
code itself could find the time to figured it out? ;)

I'm sure Bob Supnik would appreciate your changes.

	Actually my problem with the Supnik emulator is that the clock runs
	_very_ fast - the "PDP11" ends up being hours ahead of the real time
	after recompiling a kernel or two.

	p11 on the other hand tends to run slow - tweeking the device.c value
	was aimed at speeding up the clock.  

>Actually,I had resolved issue of linking and the prepended underscores before. 

	With a change to 'geni.c' or by editing the instab.s file?

	Yep - that's what I was seeing until I regenerated the instab.s file
	by running 'geni'.  The emulator would compile and link with a 
	manually edited instab.s file but simply would not run correctly.  

	Since the same RP06 image worked with the Supnik emulator I knew it
	wasn't in the 2.11BSD area.

It was a change to geni.c.   The Begemot I have (2.3) had apparent mods
already done for FreeBSD, but I still had to hack geni to resolv the
underscores.   it was a simple change though, as I recall.

I tried the patches against the virgin begemot 2.3 code, and I'm still 
seeing the unresolved's due to underscores.   Just FYI that they don't
apply to the Flea-3.0-CURRENT.

Thanks HEAPs tho ;)
