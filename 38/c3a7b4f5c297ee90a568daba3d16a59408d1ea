Possibly. I use gvim. :-)  And, no, I won't start _that_ discussion.
To each his own, live and let live.

It is actively maintained and developed.

The latter.

For _printed_ matter, the current texinfo does fine at table of
contents.  The upcoming version of texinfo (in prerelease now) has
new indexing capabilities that bring it on par with what you see
in commercial publishing: multilevel indexing, as well as "see" and
"see also" entries.

I agree that Info isn't lovely; I prefer to read the generated HTML
from makeinfo, or the PDF from texi2pdf.

Much of the growth in the markup language has been at my urging
over the years. :-)

eqn is the inspiration for math mode in TeX.  That's very clear,
and Knuth was also aware of tbl.

Thanks for that pointer. I'll have to take a look at it.
