​+1​  thanks Doug -- great smile for a Monday morning.

I've never quite fully understood this style of behavior by IT folks.
It's a control issue for sure, but when I seen my IT folks as looking at me
and my colleagues as people that can help them, it generally has worked
well.   It's funny, DEC's IT group knew never mess with research or
engineering because KO or GB would come down them.  I think they loved the
Compaq merger because quickly, the IT group 'was in charge' and we got told
to 'bugger off' - did not matter if some one in engineering or research had
invented the idea or technique and they had it configure incorrectly.  They
knew it was supposed to work ;-)

It has gotten outright silly a few times in my life.  Tektronix was great,
and DEC worked well; but I've found IT departments run by 'big iron' (IBM
back in the day, MSFT these days) don't want to listen.  They have 'the
solution' - your square peg will be made to conform.    We only have round
holes, that's all we need so that's all you should also....

Intel is mostly that way, although I will say the Macs at Intel sub-group in
IT is one of the best I have ever worked.  I think part of the reason why
they listen to people like me when the rest of IT will let them, is they
are way fewer people than they need to support the few thousand Macs at Intel.
 So, if I call they know something really is fubar, as I would have fixed
it myself it was minor or told them how to fix it for me if I could (needed
some silly IT permission).
