I am well aware of that, but ironically Intel did not even informed Andrew
about it... No one in the MINIX community was aware of that.

How long ago have you checked how busy are MINIX git commits... there has
been literally none since at least a few months.  It is practically a dead
project as far as new development is concerned.

Plus it never really drew attention of really influential luminaries from
the open source world... there is no Theo or Alan Cox amongst MINIX kernel
hackers.  Most of the core members were always coming from VU in Amsterdam
(where Andrew teaches).

I would love to see MINIX succeed, but it is just not happening and it has
been 10 years since the release of MINIX 3.
