I >>think<< it is more likely 06:30 UTC, as IIRC Daylight Saving Time
finished mid-month so I think it would have been UTC+8:00 [not +7:00 which
it would be now].   That said, Nixon [...shutter...] was in office and he
put the US went on DST in the winter at some point due to the oil crisis
(but I thought that was a year or so later).  I remember it all happening
at the time - but I can do not put precise dates on any of it.

If you want to be be 100% accurate and use UTC, then you would need to
check a precise calendar that had all those details to see how the US had
its clocks set on October 30, 1969.  The good news was the transmission
stayed with the same time zone, which as I said was Pacific (UCLA is in Los
Angeles area and SRI in the Bay Area - but both are California - which
follows US, DST rules).  The question is what were the rules that were in
effect that night.
