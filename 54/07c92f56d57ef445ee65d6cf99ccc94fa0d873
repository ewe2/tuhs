Says "with the 4.3 BSD Tahoe sources, circa 1989. 74 MB"

The 4.3BSD-Tahoe files from the tuhs mirrors are around 72MB extracted. 
The 4.3tahoe directory on McKusick's CSRG Archive CD is around 123 MB; 
The src sources for tahoe from that CD is around 85 MB.

I am guessing the data from it already exists.

By the way, I am looking for:

1) CSRG's SCCS history from around 1985 (note that as source we renamed 
or removed the new SCCS no longer has the previous history) including 
the original BIND source with nameser.c.

2) 2.1BSD through 2.6BSD
