At this instant, there is an accessible
link at

http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=2724348

though it has some popups.  A very nice story
indeed.  I talked to the author (Konstantin Kakaes)
for a couple of hours in March. He really did want
to know mostly about the kind of things the article
talks about, and though the PR guy had probably told
him that I wouldn't get into things like SCO, in fact
that wasn't what he was interested in.
