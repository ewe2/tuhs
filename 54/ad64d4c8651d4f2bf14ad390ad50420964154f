Apropos of OCR on shabby typewriting, I've had good luck with doing
the OCR twice with the paper differently positioned, then using diff
to spot discrepancies. For a final proofreading, a team of two--one
reading the original aloud, the other checking the copy, works much
faster and more accurately than a single person checking side-by-side
texts.
