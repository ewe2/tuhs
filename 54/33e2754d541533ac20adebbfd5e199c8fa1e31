Hi Deborah,

I appreciate your comment. We need to be civil, especially in a world 
where so little civility remains. We who celebrate the past do not want 
our efforts to be diminished by our base demeanor. I do not think 
leaving is the best option, however. Perhaps this could serve as a call 
to our more honorable selves to step up and rethink our netiquette. 
Stick it out and see if the dialog improves in tone after your putting 
the community on notice. I think most folks on the list are reasonable 
and honestly desirous of a positive community experience.

Regards,

Will
