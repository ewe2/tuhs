Hi All.

Back in October I started a discussion about QED sources.  A number of
people were kind enough to send me tarballs and zip files as well as
pointers to other archives.

I have finally cobbled it all together and made it available on GitHub:

	https://github.com/arnoldrobbins/qed-archive

I have tried to acknowledge everyone who contributed.

Thanks again to all who did send me stuff and email me.

Enjoy,

Arnold
