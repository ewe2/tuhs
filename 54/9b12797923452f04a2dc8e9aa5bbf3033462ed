Back in the 1970's Paul Pierce used a D/A converter on a PDP-11 at the UW 
Computer Systems Lab to generate music much like early PC sound cards did 
-- by combining harmonics in various ratios.  Although he happened to have 
used RT-11, there is no reason why it could not be done under Unix.  (The 
UW Computer Systems Lab also had a Votrax).

So, sure, you could, with an A/D and D/A converter do something like 
that.  I am not sure that the various emulators have done emulation for A/D 
or D/A, but in principle, it ought to be possible.

AC coupling (via a capacitor) of the input or output would remove any 
concerns about the relatively high DC voltages.  Besides, input signals 
ordinarily come into the grids of vacuum tube circuits by way of a 
transformer.  Ditto for outputs from tube circuits.
