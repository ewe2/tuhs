The move was from termcap to terminfo.  Termlib was the library for termcap.

There were two problems with termcap.  One was that the two-character 
name space was running out of room, and the codes were becoming less and 
less mnemonic.

But the big motivator was performance.  Reading in a termcap entry from 
/etc/termcap was terribly slow.  First you had to scan all the way 
through the (ever-growing) termcap file to find the correct entry.  Once 
you had it, every tgetstr (etc) had to scan from the beginning of the 
entry, so starting up a program like vi involved quadratic performance 
(time grew as the square of the length of the termcap entry.)  The VAX 
11/780 was a 1 MIPS processor (about the same as a 1 MHz Pentium) and 
was shared among dozens of timesharing users, and some of the other 
machines of the day (750 and 730 Vaxen, PDP-11, etc.) were even slower.  
It took forever to start up vi or more or any of the termcap-based 
programs people were using a lot.

I wrote a paper about it for Usenix in 1982, but it seems to be lost to 
Google.  Here is a nice write-up Pavel Curtis posted about it with more 
detail about the motivation:
