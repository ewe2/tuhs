For many years I used to collect old SCSI disks that otherwise would have 
met a sticky end*.  The most reliable ones were Fujitsu (they just 
soldiered on and on) with HP next (they made a noise like a jet engine, 
but I'm partially deaf anyway, due to attending too many *loud* rock 
concerts#).

To this day, I still keep an eye out on the verge,

They were chucked out for the sin of being deemed too small for the latest 
bloatware, but I never did find one small enough to act as a perfect RAID 
journal.  The littlest one was 2Gb, whilst I was searching for something 
around 20Mb.  Yes, I'm weird.
