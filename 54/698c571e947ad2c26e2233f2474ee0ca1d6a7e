I don't disagree.  But I think there is a universal system, although it 
has been left to crumble to dust over the years, and having been picked up 
it still needs a lot of work to be usable in the 21st century.  That would 
be CDE - I'm not aware of any other X Window environment that made it into 
any versions of the Unix standard (iirc it's part of "Unix 93 
Workstation"?)

A tablet environment doesn't work very well on a desktop, although a 
desktop environment can work reasonably well on a tablet (been there done 
that; I have a Windows 10 tablet).

Herd of cats sums it up nicely.

At least CUA makes a reasonable baseline, and most open-source GUI 
environments and programs seem to support that, as have Windows and OS/2 
since almost the beginning.
