Cool! I bet this was it! It was on a System 4 system.

The commands were entered at the top of the screen. I remember almost
nothing else about it.

Is there any chance you still have the source?

Thanks,

IMHO: it was before cshell, termcap, vi et al was released inside of the rest of the Bell System and there seemed to be sometimes "SW from BSD be bad/crude" 'tude.  IIRC ber and mmp must have had it running on the Marx's brothers systems in Whippany.  But he had vi, so I personally never used it.
