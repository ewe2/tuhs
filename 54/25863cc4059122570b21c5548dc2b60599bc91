I saw this post and it reminded me of a meeting that Dennis and I had
with Bill Wulf.  At one point, Dennis decided to write an optimizer but
gave up after a week or two because when he had coded the data
structures he needed he had filled up the PDP-11 memory!   It was a very
strong part of the Unix meme that Unix and C would run on small
computers since most of the universities couldn't afford bigger ones at
the time.=20

When PCC came along and started running on 32-bit machines, I started
thinking about algorithms for optimization.  A problem that I had no
good solution for could be illustrated by a simple piece of code:=20

         x =3D *p;=20

         y =3D *q;=20

         q gets changed=20

         *q =3D z;=20

The question is, do I need to reload x now because q might have been
changed to point to the same place as p?   At around this time, Al Aho
was invited to go to CMU and give a talk, and he invited me to come with
him.  We spent about an hour and a half one-on-one with Bill Wulf -- I
seem to remember a lot of mutual respect going on.  But when I asked him
about my problem, he really didn't have much to say about it.  I finally
got him to agree that his compiler had a bug.  But he said there was a
flag they could set on the compiler that would turn of optimization and
if your program had mysterious bugs, you should use the flag.=20

I recall that Al, always in search of better algorithms, was a bit
disappointed -- I was a bit more pragmatic about it.  On the whole, it
was a good meeting, and the "Engineering ... Compiler" book was one of
my favorites when it came out.=20
