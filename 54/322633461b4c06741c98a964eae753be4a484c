``From a hardware perspective, the PiDP is just a frontpanel for a 
Raspberry PI. In the hardware section below, the technical details of the 
front panel are explained. In fact, the front panel could just as easily 
be driven by any microcontroller (or FPGA), it only lights the leds and 
scans the switch positions.''
