Intel was a big customer of ours and we found it highly amusing how
secretive they were about CPU code names and product plans.  You could
go to Wikipedia and see all that stuff.  At the time they thought it
was a secret.

They were just as secretive about their employees.  Yet you could look
up any one of them on Linkedin and see what they've been doing at Intel.

Strange culture.  Seems to generate some good CPUs but I wonder if that
is because of that culture or in spite of it?
