The answer could be as simple as -- you are using one such medium at this
very moment.  I honestly believe technical mailing lists are the last
bastion of information exchange in the way most of us still remember.
Although I am writing this on an iPhone (and it really sucks for writing) I
still love to read/write emails on an old school DEC terminal or DOS era
VGA monitor.

All those new fads like reddit or web based forums just don't feel "right"
to me.
