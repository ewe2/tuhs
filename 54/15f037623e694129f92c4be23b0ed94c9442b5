Kinda sounds like me.  Classic Microsoft BASIC, then QBASIC which was a 
mutant freak dialect with structs, functions and stuff... started learning 
C++ and then moved to C.  I rarely use anything these days but C and once 
in a blue moon QBASIC for something quick and dirty.

This.

I think it blends terseness, cleanness, simplicity and ease of use in just 
the right quantities in a way no language before or since has really been 
able to muster.  Its only real weakness to me is that it isn't very good 
at string handling (the reason I sometimes kitbash stuff in BASIC still).

-uso.
