    > Are your other changes available anywhere?

Yeah, they're all up-loaded, and linked to from my 'Running MINI-UNIX on the
LSI-11' page:

  http://ana-3.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/tech/unix/Mini/Mini.html

It's mostly done, but I'll probably continue to tweak it a bir.

If anyone notices any errors, or has questions that aren't answered there, etc
please let me know.

Feel free to go for it, if people think it would be useful. (I'm not sure
there is a 'basic' MINI-UNIX repo to start on.)
