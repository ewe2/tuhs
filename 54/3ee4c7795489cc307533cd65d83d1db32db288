Wikipedia mentions one called "CDC display code" that went :ABC..., then
the digits followed after Z.

Also, according to Wikipedia, Fieldata was a seven-bit code with A at
006 (putting Z at 037) - it wasn't ASCII-like at all, except for having
the letters in a continuous run.

That sounds like ECMA-1. Does it start off "sp HT LF VT FF CR SO SI ( )"
from 00?

mentions it as an "ISO 6 bit"
