Btw.  This was some I used as a wizards test.=20

You have a working system next to a system that is still running so you have=
 the console and its shell but had the rm -fr / done to it.  You have lost a=
ll of bin dev etc and lib by the time he hit ^C.   So you have some of /usr i=
nc but much of /usr/bin is still there.    No compiler or assembler on the b=
roken machine since that was in bin and lib.  =20

It=E2=80=99s possible to fix it using the other system to help.  Just don=E2=
=80=99t turn the damaged system off =F0=9F=8D=BA

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.=
