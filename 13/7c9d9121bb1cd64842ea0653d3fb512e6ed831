Was T1 a "digital" line interface, or was this rather a 24x3.1 kHz channel?

How was the 64 ??? Kbit/s interface to the first IMPs implemented?

Wasn't it AT&T that provided the lines for the first IMPs?

I was always wondering how they could provide such a "high speed" line in the 
1960s.

I hope somebody knows this....
