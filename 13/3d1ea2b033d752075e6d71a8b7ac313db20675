I'm familiar with that (and also the fact that "aluminum" and "color" etc 
were British spelling).  Being born and bred British with pedantic parents 
I've always hated "American" spelling as we called it, and it's sad to see 
such noted media as the Sydney Morning Herald slowly adopting it over the 
past few years; Australia has used British spelling at least since I 
emigrated here in 1965.

Oh, it was meant to be a creat/create joke, BTW...

I don't like my chances with suggesting that to Apple; I'm not even sure 
if they even take user contributions (although back when I was on the dole 
and having delusions of grandeur I did register as an Apple developer, but 
I suspect that that's for non-Apple stuff i.e. it goes into the Apple 
Store).

I have done the odd binary patch (usually to reconfigure Unify database 
volumes back when I was with FGH)...  Not right now, though, as it's time 
for bed.
