I checked my email log for my previous MERT enquiries, and that's the exact
same advice I got from Brian Kernighan when I asked him (a couple of years
back) if he had any suggestions for tracking it down.

I guess I need to finally get a 'round tuit'... unless there's someone else
here who knows him well, and wants to give it a go.
