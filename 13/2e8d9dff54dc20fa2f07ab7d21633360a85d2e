I *suppose* that if I transplanted a patched kernel on the install floppy
it'd install.  The install is SUPER tedious doing it with diskettes so I'm
not jumping at this at the moment.. .However this would have altered the
install media... Does that matter?

I guess someone should the ISA machine in Qemu 0.12 doesn't work at ALL...
So this also means no fun with Novell Netware 3.12 either...!

I've added a section there.. I think I did it right..?  Although I can't
figure out how to send a screenshot.  I added one for Xenix a while ago but
I forget.

It's my impression that 386BSD is under the BSD license, probably the old 4
clause one where you had to give credit to the regents etc... although I
think they retroactively changed that?

I'm pretty sure it should be no different then Free/Net/Open BSD's.
