I fear a sad part of this slide show is that many of us remember and were
part of it all.   Some of us  programmed these machines (I admit that I
still have some of these pieces in my basement).  I was disappointed they
did not show a "stinger tap." The picture of the Alto shows the first mouse
â€“ the Hawley Labs mechanical mouse (which I miss for its feel).   Check out
the picture of the first Cisco router using Intel Multibus (with a Motorola
68k in it) looking so awkward.
