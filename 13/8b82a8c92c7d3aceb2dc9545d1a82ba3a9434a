It was indeed.  As I age, brain farts are multiplying in what I am
pleased to call my mind.  To make it worse, I'll probably say "Dennis"
a few more times before I get it fixed.  Google helps compensate, and
I'm getting better about verifying things, but not always.

Is a chair finely made tragic or comic? Is the portrait of Mona Lisa
good if I desire to see it? Is the bust of Sir Philip Crampton lyrical,
epical or dramatic?  If a man hacking in fury at a block of wood make
there an image of a cow, is that image a work of art? If not, why not?
