Sorry autocorrect bit me.   And being discussed by both faculty and grad students a like 

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.

It could be Accent inspired, it could also be a natural solution for sending datagrams. For example, Jack Haverty had hacked a “raw datagram” facility into UoI Arpanet Unix around ’79 (it’s in the Unix Tree).

I’m being told that the CSRG team procrastinated on this because they did not see much use for it — and indeed it was mostly ignored in the field for the next two decades. Joy had left by that time, so perhaps the dynamics had changed.
