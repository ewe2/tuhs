Not really.  You want history files, I have one for each tty.  Telling
the tty driver to write to this inode seems sort of weird.  I guess you
could make it work, but to me, this screams libc or libhistory or 
something like that.  I agree it shouldn't be in each app that wants
it but isn't that what libraries are for?
