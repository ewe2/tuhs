It seems that you confuse the program "sccs" from Eric Allman with SCCS in 
general.

sccs	see: http://sccs.sourceforge.net/man/sccs.1.html
	is a wrapper program that helps to use the SCCS worker programs.
	"sccs" was written at UC Berkeley since Max 10 1980.

	Check the bottom SEE ALSO paragraph.

admin cdc comb delta get help prs prt rmdel sact unget val
	are the worker programs that predate the existence of the "sccs"
	program by many years.
	These programs have been written at AT&T by Marc.

BTW: The SCCSv4 history format was introduced February 18, 1977 and is still
understood by recent software.

CSRG includes the UCB history for the AT&T SCCS commands as well, but they have 
not been legally available before December 20 2006. The AT&T sources "slipped"
into the CSRG archives and nobody really complained ;-)
