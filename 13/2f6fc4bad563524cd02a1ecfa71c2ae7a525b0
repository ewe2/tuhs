i agree with Peter, WRT the '181 you can certainly find them in small
qualities in the after market, I may have a handful of them myself.   One
thing you are missing is a small barrel shifter, which the '181 does not
support, but for a 8 bit shift it should not be terrible.   Vaxen and such
built their independently, but it is worth while IMO, as it allows in a
single clock tick to perform pretty substantial arithmetic, although
because it's a sq law the cost in die area is huge. If you look at the 68K
for instance, the big area in the middle everyone sees in the pictures is
the shifter (same for the Alpha chips).
