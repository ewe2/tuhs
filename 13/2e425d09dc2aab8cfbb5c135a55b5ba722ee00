Interesting. I continually forget the hardware that existed back in the 
day. I vaguely remember using line printers, but then it was laser not 
too long after that, so it's pretty fuzzy. My coding days came in the 
dot matrix days, but again laser was not too long after that :). I 
definitely heart 72 character lines - but prolly cuz of email more than 
anything else except maybe the adage of, if it won't fit on screen (in a 
terminal window), it's probably too complicated, which I still think is 
reasonable.
After this thread, I think I'll probably stick to tabs because they seem 
to work better across environments.
