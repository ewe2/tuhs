Hi Paul,

rchitecture back in 2014/2015 and the good thing about it is that it still =
compiles with a modern gcc.

I found similarities between the 2.11BSD and 10th edition sources -
presumably 2.11BSD was based on (or incorporated) changes in the 10th
edition?

BTW did you publish your work?

I have been able to get c0 working. I had to work around the use of
sbrk() as this is not supported on Windows. I also changed the output
to text format - mainly so that I can see what is being generated.

> The second pass =E2=80=98c1=E2=80=99 would need major restructuring. It m=
ainly builds a tree for each expression and then performs various transform=
ations, many of which are PDP11 specific (but also portable ones, like hand=
ling of constant expressions). It then covers the tree with code fragments =
selected from a library. This library (=E2=80=98optable') would need a full=
 rewrite as well.

This part will be more difficult I suspect - but I will only start on
this after I have converted c0 to output 64-bit compliant intermediate
code.

It seems that Dennis Ritchie wrote a paper 'A Tour through the Unix C
Compiler' which is quite useful in understanding the compiler. I have
converted the doc to Markdown format as well which makes it easier to
read.

Thanks and Regards
Dibyendu
