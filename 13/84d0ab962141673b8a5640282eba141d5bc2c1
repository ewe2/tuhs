Berkeley Tague says he invited John to work with the USG in 1978=20
	[ AUUG, below. Also by Ronda Hauben in multiple places ]

	[ In two =E2=80=98recollections=E2=80=99 / history docs sourced =
from UNSW, ]
	[ the first visit was misremembered as 1976 or 1977. ]

I was wondering when John's two other sabbaticals to Bells Labs were.

The Peter Ivanov interview with John in =E2=80=9CUnix Review=E2=80=9D, =
1985, notes two sabbaticals by then.

	After writing the celebrated Commentary on the UNIX Operating =
System in 1976,=20
	Lions was asked to spend two sabbaticals at the Labs.

This comment in 2000 on =E2=80=9C9fans=E2=80=9D from Rob Pike
says John also visited in 1989,=20
but sadly his work by then had been affected.

	<https://marc.info/?l=3D9fans&m=3D144372955601968&w=3D2>

Anyone know when the other visit was?

Presumably 1983 or 1984 if John took a semester off every 5 years.

then
	He wanted to come to Murray Hill for his sabbatical so it was a =

	He spent two or three summers at Bell Labs over the years=20
	and supplied us with many of his graduate students=20
	for sabbaticals and permanent employment.

	What have been the professional highlights of your career?

	For myself, three sabbaticals at Bell Laboratories have been =

	For my students, opportunities arose for employment at the =
Laboratories.
