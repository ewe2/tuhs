Solaris 2.0 was the first SVr4 version of Solaris. 4.1.{1,2,3} were
still BSD based, and Solaris 2.0 was SunOS 5.0 and OpenWindows.

I recently came across a CD ROM that was labeled Solaris 2.0 Preview
and Solbourne's name written in Magic Marker on it. I have no clue how
I came to have it, but it was mixed in my ancient CDROM disc
collection...
