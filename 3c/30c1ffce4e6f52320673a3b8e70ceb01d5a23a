I use postfix + postgrey. But greylisting doesn't seem to work
any more. I detect spam using various scripts. As you put it,
"accretion of crud"!  I block spammer IP addrs via pf.
Probably not the right thing to do.  Should look into various
anti-spamming mail filters again. It is trivial to manually
detect spam so probably should experiment with NN code for
this.

I too use nmh (and MH before then). But since my last upgrade
repl, comp, forw seem to bring up a blank X-MH-Attachment in
vi.  Used to bring ~/Mail/drafts/<number> file, initialized
with interpreted contents of "components" or "replcomps" file.
Haven't gotten around to  looking into this. [This is a
problem with many "maintained" software packages.  Things
evolve and if you update only sporadically, you just may miss
a crucial update or two!]
