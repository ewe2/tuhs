Correct, it got dumped in favor of the VFS layer from SunOS, which I
said already.

My point is that you were telling Berny that the FSS wasn't from
SV but it was.

You should go read that wikipedia page, so far as I can tell it's pretty
accurate and has a better version of the history that you do.  

I suspect you've fallen victim to various people claiming stuff that
wasn't really accurate.  Like Bill Joy being responsible for SVr4.
If by "responsible" you mean he worked on the code, I'm sure that's
not true.  If by "responsible" you mean he talked to AT&T about it,
sure, that's pretty likely.  You made it sound like the former which
just isn't plausible.  For lots of reasons.
