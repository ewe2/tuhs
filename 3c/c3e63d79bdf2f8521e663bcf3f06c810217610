I wrote a VT05 emulator some while ago: https://github.com/aap/vt05
It's certainly not perfect and probably has some bugs, but I somehow had
the urge to write it for no particular reason.
I would actually be interested in the newline delay the machine needs
because I didn't implement it. 

I hope this doesn't derail the discussion too much, but I would actually
like to know which teletypes were used at bell labs. What strikes me as
odd is that in UNIX lower case is the norm yet the ASR-33, which I would
assume was ubiquitous, does only to upper case and also doesn't do some
characters used by C, like {}. In this famous photo you see ASR-33s...so
were they really the main interface to early UNIX?
