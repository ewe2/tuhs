I tripped across a project the other day which was a commercial,
proprietary, and undocumented system that still used "Open" in their company

I'm trying to figure out what aspect they are claiming is open.

"Free" and "open" are, by themselves, ambiguous words.  It is when you
combine them that you get the meaning that is often intended by Linux, GNU
and OpenBSD people.
