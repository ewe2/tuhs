Did he actually say that? In this delightful interview
   =20
https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/107413/oh332dk.pdf

in response to a question about were there any giant steps
in CS, he says the idea of Structured Programming is a giant
step but those are few and far between. A number of times he
comments on structured programming (as opposed to HLLs). About
Go To and SP:

  "It is like the zero population growth movement: The goal isn=E2=80=99t
really to have zero population growth; the goal is to improve
people=E2=80=99s quality of life. But they substitute a quantitative =
goal
for the qualitative goal, and that=E2=80=99s like viewing structured
programming as only a non-=E2=80=98Go To=E2=80=99 type of a program, =
which is
foolish, and I am sure Edsger didn=E2=80=99t mean it that way at all."

He also mentions he wrote an Algol compiler for Burroughs during
the summer of 1960.

Knuth finished the first draft of what became TAOCP in 1966.
Given that there were already many discussions about Algol X
but no clarity and that he really did want people to understand
what steps are needed and their cost, that is, get close to the
computer, MIX made more sense (I'm glad it wasn't Fortran!).
MIX wouldn't have made sense for TeX & METAFONT, which are in
essence *recipes* made out of algorithmic ingredients and in
effect he reimplemented these algorithms in Pascal.=
