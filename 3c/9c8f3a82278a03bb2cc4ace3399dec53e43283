Hi,

I've imaged (with ImageDisk) some floppies I've got with my "new" 8560 
system.

You can find them at 
ftp://ftp.groessler.org/pub/chris/tektronix/8560/diskimages .

Among other things there are cross-assemblers for 68000, 6809, and 6800.
 From the TNIX installation disk set one is missing (disk 5 of 5).

I'm looking for the Z8000 cross-assembler for TNIX. Does anyone have it?

regards,
chris
