But remember; without Emacs, we might never have had _The Cuckoo's
Egg_. Imagine the terror of that loss.

Or not. (Though Stoll's book was one of the things that more or less
introduced me to the idea of operating systems other than DOS/Windows.
I don't remember how many times I borrowed that book from the local
library, but it was probably in the double digits at least. Later I
got my own copy, which I still have.)
