While testing a crazy project I wanted to get working I came across this ancient link:

Mt Xinu is currently finishing up its release of 2.6 MSD for the i386.
2.6 MSD is a CMU-funded standard distribution of the Mach kernel,
release-engineered with the following:
	2.5 Mach kernel, with NFS & BSD-tahoe enhancements
	Transarc's AFS
	X11R4
	most of the 4.3-tahoe BSD release
	Andrew Tool Kit
	Camelot transaction processing system
	Cornell's ISIS distributed programming environment
	most of the FSF utilities
	a few other nifty things

Was any of this stuff ever saved?  I know on the CSRG CD there is some buried source for Mach 2.5 although I haven’t seen anything on where to even start to compile it, how or even how to boot it...  I know Mach is certainly not fast, nor all that ‘small’ but it’d be interesting to see a 4.3BSD on a PC!
