Seems to me that we have a decent, relatively current case study of
this with Python 2 vs Python 3.

Which is probably a good bit easier actually, because maintaining the
ability to run Python 2 applications while introducing the ability to
run Python 3 applications is likely easier than introducing changes to
how something as relatively fundamental as how ".." behaves in paths
while at the same time maintaining backwards compatibility with the
old behavior, where different users and different applications on the
same system might very well expect different behavior...
