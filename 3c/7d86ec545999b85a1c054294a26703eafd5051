Multics had dash options, so that's presumably where Unix got them
from. I believe slash options were mostly a DEC thing that DOS and its
successors borrowed (I think they originated in TOPS-10). I don't
think there was any widespread syntax for options when the first
versions of Unix were written, and slash and dash options weren't the
only syntaxes used (e.g. JCL-ish key=value options were used on some
systems). The thing that I wonder about was why ">" wasn't used as the
directory separator when paths were added to Unix, since that's what
Multics used.
