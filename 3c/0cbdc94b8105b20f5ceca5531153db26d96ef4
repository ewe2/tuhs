Subject: stty erase '^?' in v7
Message-ID: <8de0efc7-0a45-02f2-5db3-7b3bbbe4b815@gmail.com>

Does anyone know why stty won't accept '^?' in v7? It will accept '^h', 
but then the shell expects ^h to "backspace". I am trying to get the 
delete key on my mac to do the backing up and it's '^?'. # isn't my 
favorite since it's used in C programs, but pressing CTRL-h to backup is 
a pain too. If you've read this far, I have three more questions:

1. How do you escape # in order to write a C program if # is the erase 
character in the terminal?
2. How do you enter a literal character in the v7 shell (I am used to 
CTRL-v CTRL-DEL to enter the delete character on other unices)?
3. Is there a way to echo the ascii value of a keypress in v7?

Thanks,

Will
