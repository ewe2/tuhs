Yes, I was _very_ happy to find those tapes in my basement; up till that, I
was almost sure all those bits were gone forever.

Thanks to Chuck Guzis, whose old data recovery service made this possible - he
actually read the tape.

Alas, they're all of the same system. So the most we're going to get is the
files that are missing on this one due to bad spots on the tape.
