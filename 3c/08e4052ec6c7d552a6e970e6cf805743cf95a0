My experience was a bit weird. I implemented one UUCP bridge for
cc:Mail (Lotus) in my enterprise. More or less between 1990 and 1992.

It worked calling (using a modem) every hour to one phone number in
Madrid and doing an interchange of messages.

Very funny, with some issues with codepages, length of messages, and so.

I think that I keep yet the manuals of this application but I'm not sure at all.
