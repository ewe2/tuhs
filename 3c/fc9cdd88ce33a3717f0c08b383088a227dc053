Sometimes a leader has to make difficult decisions. I see no point in
making them more difficult by playing armchair quarterback after the fact.

I also see no point in establishing an entire bureaucracy just to handle a
problem that only comes up once every 10 years.

Well, this is a fascinating place.  So many pioneers, including Warren's
endless contributions can be found here.

I would feel awful if I were kicked out without any kind of due process.  I
mean 100 years from now, this place will live on and continue to be a
primary source.

Perhaps, it would be better for Warren to create a policy, if it does not
already exist, and then show how that policy was violated.

Next, there should also be a panel of at least three arbiters that could be
used for the subject to appeal any decision.

Also, having a policy in place would allow for progressive discipline to be
implemented: first a warning, then privileges suspended and finally
privileges revoked.



Truly,

Bill Corcoran
