I know that, because I have used djgpp for a quite lot of time.

I thought , that Bill wanted to "scale down" gcc compiler to 16 bit 
environment, and probably djgpp could be a good starting point.
I understand , that gcc is not "directly" portable.But because gcc can 
create pdp code in cross compile environment, perhaps it is not impossible .

BTW I have just ported Bob Supnik pdp11 emulator to Coherent 4.2.10 and 
it seems to work(compile works etc). Coherent being 32 bit for 386 
processors has nonetheless 286 support builtin in kernel, so it seems to 
be good environment for this simulator (?).
I have the same problem as Bill, I have to kill pdp11 process on another 
console to exit.
