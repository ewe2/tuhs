​Two things...

1.) I think we are in complete agreement wrt to code quality - and I think
LM is probably correct that Sun had the first real quality implementation.
2.) Paul's question was a little different and I was able to chat with him
about it at lunch today.    Until a year or so ago, Paul was a
compiler/linker guy and was interested less in the OS extension to support
shared libraries, but more when did different tool chains start to support
it. * i.e.* How did we get from a.out to ELF.

The key is that make shared libraries real for the tool chain, you need OS
support for shared memories.    It turns out that Joy's BSD Unix took its
shared memory API (mmap) from Tenex's 'PMAP JSYS' (which BTW, the '72 Tenex
CACM paper calls out shared libraries modelled after Multics - I was trying
to google the API specific and failed - I think its darned near 1x1).  I'm
also pretty sure that PMAP influenced the VMS shared memory call that
Cutler would build in the mid 70s.  Not only that, In Rashid's 81 Accent
paper, he too referenced Tenex's PMAP too (more in a minute).

Also, please remember, that BSD's mmap was not the first shared memory call
for any UNIX.  Horton & Johnson can correct me, but I think Dale's team in
Columbus had a shared memory in a  PDP-11 ??PWB 1.0?? style system - that
would eventually begat the System V shmem call (i've got a hard copy of it
somewhere in my archives).

What I do not remember, and this is where someone like Steve might know,
was could COFF use the Columbus shmem to do shared libs?   Certainly by
that time, shared libraries for UNIX was being heavily discussed both in
and out of AT&T.  I remember that either V.2 or V.3 had a shared lib scheme
that put the libraries at a static address as the System V kernel support
was not very flexible.   But to Paul's question, was that AT&T had started
to put shared libs into their flavor around the same time?   *i.e. *when
did Summit start to support it.

I was trying to get an account of which versions of which OS
distributions/releases had some sorts of kernel extensions that allowed
shared libraries and that also supported tool chains that could provide
them -- *i.e.* what Paul was asking about.  I was not commenting on who's
kernel to support same was good or bad.  I did comment on the file format.
COFF was a dead end because of the way Summit's management introduced it to
larger Unix community, even if it was 'better' and solved some of the
earlier issues with a.out.

Macho was already there for instance, and it was an 'extensible' version of
a.out and had some level of support for architecture of the binary
contained within.   How v6/v7 a.out got extended to support shared libs,
had varied widely by different manufacturers tool chains.   Originally,
most manufacturers still called it a.out and just hacked on their own
version of the toolchain.  CMU gave it a different name (macho) and IIRC made
the kernel handle both *i.e. *still supported the original BSD a.out but
you were limited in what could be done with it to only the 4.1BSD api.
Remember, Mach 1.0, reacting to Accent' failure, was BSD4.1++ so they
wanted to be able to run BSD binaries, at least on Vaxen.  In fact the way
you installed Mach1.0 was build a new kernel boot it on your 4.1BSD system.
Binary compatibility was sort of new concept for the University community
--- in fact, around that time at UCB I remember Joy once saying he thought
it was good to force people to recompile as it ensured the code was not
stale.


So moving forward, AT&T's COFF had tried to repair the many different
a.outs, but AT&T made other major non-technical missteps so only firms that
were late in the Unix world bothered with it.  And even after trying to be
'common', it too,  got extended in N different incompatible (uncommon) ways.

As I said, I am not sure how ELF really became the universal format, other
than timing.   AT&T for whatever reason did not have a fit when it was
reimplemented by Gnu - but by the Gnu guys doing that, and the FOSS
community switching to that version of the compiler, ELF did win in the
long run.   And fortunately, the Gnu version of ELF and the SVR4 version
seems/appears to be were pretty close [as far as I know they matched, but
if someone knows otherwise, I defer to them].

As for the kernel stuff, my other point is that >>idea<< of mmap/pmap was
kicking around the Unix community by numerous folks hacking on the kernel
for a longer time then when it was finally implemented.  LM reminds us that
you need something for memory sharing to implement shared libraries.  But
memory sharing added to Unix before shared libraries was added to the tool
chains.

 I do find it interesting the UCB mmap API call pretty much was all of the
Unix kernel implementation agreed to be the memory sharing API and that it
happens to be pretty much the same call as Tenex's PMAP.   As Paul
mentioned at lunch today for him, VMS, Tenex/TOP-20 and eventually Unix it
was pretty much the same call for him implementing the user space
linker/loader calls, which is part of why he was asking when did the tools
start to support it all.
