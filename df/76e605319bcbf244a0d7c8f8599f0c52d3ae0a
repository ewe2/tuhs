It is the nature of unmoderated mailing lists that topics will drift over 
time until someone jumps in to change the Subject: (and it really ought to 
be a new thread) and hope that others will take the hint.

Yes, I'm just as guilty as others; then again, I've also changed the 
subject when I realise my transgression.

They would then need to see what new topics come up from time to time...

I believe they are on Mailman, but I have little experience with running 
it.

On one list I use, a predecessor of it used to require a subject tag in 
the form [Blah] (taken from a set of known tags); I've always hated that, 
but I'm still in the habit of putting my own tag there as a hint.
