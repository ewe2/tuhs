I think that certain amount of the reliability issue, as far as both the
tapes and the drives are concerned, has to do with scale.  Those 8mm
Exabyte tapes (DDS tapes, too) are much thinner and hence more easily
damaged than a large 9 track reel.  If thin tape in a cartridge gets fouled
up past a certain point, forget it, there's no salvaging that cartridge.
If open reel tape gets damaged and you really need what's on it you can
hope that the mechanism can read past the damaged part (a possibility), or
as a last resort you could make a careful splice and then attempt to
retrieve the rest of the data.

One of the other issues, totally independent of tape, is the rubber chosen
by the manufacturers for the drive belts and rollers.  Some rubber, stored
properly, will still be in usable shape after twenty or thirty years.  The
rubber on the rollers of my Sun QIC-150 drive?  A goopy mess which rendered
the drive useless as well as a tape.

But yeah, about 15 years ago I was asked to retrieve some data from Exabyte
8200 tapes that had been written 10 years prior.  I went through three
drives and countless hours of frustration just to read a half-dozen tapes
with some really important information on them.  "Archive format" indeed.
