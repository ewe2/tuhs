Yes. Bag files are a file format used to transfer news via uucp,
popularized by dnews. I think they originated with satellite news
systems.

"Setting up a UUCP feed into DNEWS
	addsvc -del dposter
	addsvc -add dposter dposter.exe "dposter -dir c:\uucp\in -to news.here.com"
    This will search for files called *.bag in the directory c:\uucp\in
    and after processing them it will delete them.  It's your job to write
    a batch script to get the files in this directory and uncompress them
    if necessary.
    You may also need to add ihave access to your own machine:
         news.here.com:read,post,ihave:::*

    The BAG/UUCP file format is:

    #! rnews nnnn
    ...(article, exactly nnnn bytes, counting each end of line as one byte)
    #! rnews nnnn
    ...(next article)...

Setting up a UUCP feed out of DNEWS
   In newsfeeds.conf add a feed, e.g.
           	site site1.name.uucp
	       		groups *

   Add a service (or process to run xmit and dposter)
	addsvc -add dxmit1 xmit.exe "dxmit1 site.name.edu -at *5 * -uucp
c:\dnews\site1 "

   This will create files called news000n.bag in the directory
c:\dnews\site1  	
   It's your job to uucp copy these to the destination sites, and delete them.
   If you want you can compress them first.  :-)

   The format of the file is:

    #! rnews nnnn
    ...(article, exactly nnnn bytes, counting each end of line as one byte)
    #! rnews nnnn
    ...(next article)..."
