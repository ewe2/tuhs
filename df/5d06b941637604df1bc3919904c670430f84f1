Nothing that interesting.  I was just passing them on to my team here at
BitMover as an example of a pile of work that was painstaking.  And had
to be exactly correct.

I wrote those so that you could develop on SunOS but retarget your code
for any other palatform and have it work.  Apparently I cared about that
more than most.  I felt strongly at the time that you'd be an idiot to
develop on any other platform, SunOS was way past being the best, it was
without peer.  So I felt safe in giving people a way to retarget their
code.

Little did I know that Solaris was waiting in the wings.
