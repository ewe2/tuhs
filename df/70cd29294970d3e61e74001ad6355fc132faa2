in principle, the .o files have to be bound (together with
the libraries) by the linker, which produces the executable.
But this is tedious to do manually, so you better use the
makefile (and the "make" utility) to run the necessary
commands automatically.

I can reproduce your problem with the c0 pass. I don't
know the exact cause but I guess it has nothing to do
with the compiler itself. I found a workaround: reset
the sticky bit for cc, i.e., do a "chmod 755 cc" in /bin.
At least on my machine I then can run the makefile for
building cc without errors.

Hellwig
