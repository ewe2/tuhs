Wandering a little far afield but ...

I'm a self taught touch typist, if you can call it that.  I've just typed
enough that it works.  But it's a thing that works when I don't think about
it, as soon as I go "oh, I'm typing without looking" it stops working.  So
I try not to think about it.

Funny thing is that I bought an excavator maybe 5 years ago or so.  Using
the joysticks to control that thing is just like my touch typing.  I've
done it enough that if I'm not thinking about it, everything just works.
And that's after about 300 hours of experience on it, which isn't a lot.
It's some, not a lot.

I'm good enough that I set this skidsteer upright with it, which was
something, that excavator is way too small for that 8000 pound skid
steer but I got her up.  And didn't break anything, or anyone, in the
process.
