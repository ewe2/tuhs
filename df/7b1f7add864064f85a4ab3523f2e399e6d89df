Subject: [pups] ACMS (Australian 'puter museum) doomed?

Ow, c'mon.  In *australia*, how hard can it be to find or make 
space for that priceless collection?  Geez!

Given the nearly-complete collection of DEC systems, HP-Oz should
be deeply ashamed if they don't pitch in, along with other vendors
and local support techs.

We can't expect all companies to maintain a collection that reflects
their history (for tech-practical reasons alone), but we *should* be
able to expect them to help others who do it "for" them...
