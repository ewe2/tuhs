Yeah that make sense.   I'm pretty sure Joy had talked about it in the
Summer '79 USENIX when 2BSD was announced.  I remember his talk and a lot
of people being awed (sort like what happens today when Linus comes to a
conference).  As I remember, one of his topics was csh and how it was
different from the shell in the original BSD.  He must have talked about #!
and few other things for kernel (a bunch of speed ups in nami/inode look
up IIRC), but that's about all I remember.  The next winter was Boulder
('The Black Hole' conference) and he did a redux, and I remember being
amazing how people were more interested in what he was saying than some of
the folks from BTL and I remember a lot of Pascal questions at Boulder,
FWIW.  But to be frank, those conferences all sort of mix a little bit in
my mind at this point.

IIRC:  Dennis was there, Bruce Borden and the Rand folks, as were other
folks like Chesson and some of the U of I folks. Thanks to my friendships
with Ted Kowalsji and later Phil Karn, I had visited the labs a few times
and had met Dennis et al in the early mid-70s, but I think that conference was
the first time I personally met some of the other university types that I
had been communication via the ArpaNet.  I might even have an old
conference list somewhere, but there was no proceedings yet for a few years.
