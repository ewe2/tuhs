LBL was part of UC Berkeley.  We were funded by DOE, who was working 
with DARPA.  But we were UC employees.  LBL had a contract with
DOE/DARPA to evaluate an early version of the the arpanet.  I was just 
getting started at that time, so only slightly involved.  The people I 
remember were Dennis Hall, Joe Sventek, Carl Quong & several other guys 
in EE.  A lot of the TCP/IP development was done at the Lab.

We also worked heavily with the CS people on campus.  I think this was 
before Kirk McKusick, Bill Joy, et al.
