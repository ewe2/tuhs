Greek and Cyrillic both have cases. And the Hiragana/Katakana distinction in Japanese is similar to case in some ways (including limited computer systems using only one)

Full list of scripts in unicode that have case distinctions (based on analyzing character names): Adlam, Armenian, Cherokee, Coptic, Cyrillic, Deseret, Georgian, Glagolitic, Greek, Latin, Old Hungarian, Osage, and Warang Citi.
