This might register low on the useful information index, but I decided a fe=
w years back as VC Coraid was coming apart and New Coraid was being resurre=
cted under the auspices of SouthSuite Inc., that I would have a C mono-cult=
ure and use the language for everything. Specifically no JavaScript and no =
Python.

Our website is written in C. Webpages generated on the server side using C.=
 Our evolving ERP is written in C. Our subscription system is written in C.=
 Our test systems are written in it. All work quite well.

The focus on C was for three main reasons. First, our products are infrastr=
ucture products and are meant to be simple, fast, and affordable. Forty-two=
 years of experience plus C gives us the ability to squeeze all the perform=
ance possible from any hardware platform. We "see" the instructions our cod=
e will generate. C is a great choice for that. (As would have been Oberon, =
but that's another discussion.)

Second, if instead of having a set of complex languages, each with its own =
adherents, using a single language removes all the distracting and divisive=
 language wars having multiple complex languages create. Little language li=
ke AWK and the shell script are fine. It's the more complex ones that divid=
e people.

Lastly, a single, powerful, simple (on the other side of complexity) langua=
ge that a single person can maintain is essential to our Software Atelier m=
odel of doing business. Like the workshops of the renaissance, we have to u=
nderstand and work on all our own tools. I use Ken's C compiler under Plan =
9. It weights in at a light, 20K lines of code.

As I said, I'm not sure how useful this data point is for you. Over the las=
t thirty years I carefully chose my foot falls through the software swamp t=
o avoid getting sucked under by one of the quagmires of complexity.
