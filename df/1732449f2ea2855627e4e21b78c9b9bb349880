Subject: [pups] Tektronix 8560 with PDP-11/23 CPU running TNIX (UINX)
Message-ID: <20030507231637.K206647@MissSophie.unixag-kl.fh-kl.de>

Hi.

I got a "Tektronix 8560 Multi-User Software Development Unit" together
with a Tektronix 8540 in system 68k CPU emulator. The 8560 is based on
the DEC M8186 PDP-11/23 CPU module but that card is the one and only DEC
part in the machine. Everything else is from Tektronix. There is a 35 MB
8" disk and a 8" floppy in the 8560 and it runs some flavor of UNIX
called TNIX. I am trying to break into it currently, as I have no
passwords. I can't get it to single user mode and I have no distribution
media nor no stand alone tools. 

Has someone heared from this machine bevore?
Has someone distribution media or stand alone tools?
