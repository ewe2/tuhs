Early pages were 1K.

The fun argument is what is Virtual Memory.    Typically, people align that with paging but you can stretch the definition to cover paging.
This was a point of contention in the early VAX Unix days as the ATT (System III, even V?) didn’t support paging on the VAX where as BSD did.
Our comment was that “It ain’t VIRTUAL memory if it isn’t all there” as opposed to virtual addressing.
