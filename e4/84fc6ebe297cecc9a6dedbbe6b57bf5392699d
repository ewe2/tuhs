Yes but there might be CPU spin-loop timing to run the serial
maintenance port from the ROM bootstrap code of the controller.
Not considered good form -- but such things happen.

Some early version of the Sigma RQD11 would work in an 11/73 but not

at the time Sigma was only an 80-mile drive from here.
