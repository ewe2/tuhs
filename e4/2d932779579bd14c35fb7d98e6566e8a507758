Actually I'm surprised that the V7 compiler would complain about this.

I seem to recall that there was still quite a lot of code in V7
(including the compiler itself) which didn't have an '=' before
the initialiser.

I don't have a V7 system to hand right now, but looking at the
compiler source appears to confirm that the '=' was still optional.

In extdef() at around line 69 of c02.c there is:

	if (o!=ASSIGN)
		peeksym = o;

... at this point in the code we have just processed an external
definition which is not a function and which is not followed by
either a comma or a semicolon and are about to attempt to parse
what follows as an initialiser. If the next symbol is '=' the
compiler swallows it, otherwise it pushes it back and continues
with parsing the initialiser.

So it certainly *looks* as if the V7 compiler didn't require the '='.

Perhaps you were using pcc?
