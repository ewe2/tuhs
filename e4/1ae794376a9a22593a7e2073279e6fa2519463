When we were running the UUCP Zone, 3Com wanted to register 3com.com 
through us.  ISI balked at it, saying the RFC said domains had to start 
with a letter.  It turned out the original code decided if it was an IP 
address or a domain name by looking at whether the first character was a 
letter or digit.  We pushed back, it was allowed, and the code (and 
eventually RFC) was fixed.  UUCP, of course, didn't have that issue.
