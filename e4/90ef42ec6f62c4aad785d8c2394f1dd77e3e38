Yea, this was part of the de minimis copying that was acknowledged...
It was mostly rewritten with most of AT&T's code gone. It's 110 lines of
code,
out of ~18,000 lines of kernel code. And the structure in 4.4BSD is somewhat
different with balloc() being completely different than the rest of V7's
subr.c.

But it likely didn't matter, since 32v likely lost its copyright protection
due
to AT&T distributing too many copies without the required copyright
markings.
At least that was the preliminary ruling that caused the suit to be
settled...
AT&T didn't want it finalized, though the cat was somewhat out of the bag
at this point...

Yea, most of the rest of the code around it was rewritten, but not that.
