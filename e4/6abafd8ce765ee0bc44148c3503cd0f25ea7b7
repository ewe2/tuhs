I emailed Mel directly and expressed interest in the following books:

  · The M4 Marco Processor
  · SED - A Non-Interactive Text Editor
  · Awk - A pattern Scanning and Processing Language
  · Yacc: Yet Another Compiler-Compiler
  · RATFOR - A Preprocessor for a Rational Fortran

Here's my comment as to why I'm interested in the aforementioned titles.

The only title that I'd *really* /like/ to get my hands on is "The M4 
Macro Processor".  (See aforementioned unhealthy interest in M4.)

I'm quite happy to share with the community.  I just want to save the 
materials from the bin if nobody else claims them.

Note:  I've not heard anything back from Mel yet.
