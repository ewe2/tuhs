FYI,  here's the patch that fixes the "df" problem that Christian reported.
If I recall correctly,  it took me about a day to figure out that the
problem wasn't in df,  wasn't in the 2.11 BSD C library,  but was in the p11
emulator.  The fact that the same disk image booted by Bob Supnik's SIMH
PDP/11 emulator produced correct "df" results was the big clue.  Here's the
fix for p11 (version 2.7).
