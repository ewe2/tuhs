Well, I'm not sure I actually _miss_ mine (my old eyes prefer black on white),
but I definitely have fond memories of it. It was such a huge thing when I
finally managed to snag one to replace my (IIRC) VT52.

You could actually have three useful windows in Emacs!! And the detached
keyboard was definitely more ergonomic.
