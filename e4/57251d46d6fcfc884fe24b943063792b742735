 |I'm not sure if it would be that simple.  With preprocessors like

Newer incarnations of man(1) support a shebang-alike control line
<^'\" >followed by concat of [egprtv]+ and include $MANROFFSEQ
content into this list, then do

   case "${preproc_arg}" in
                  e)      pipeline="$pipeline | $EQN" ;;
                  g)      GRAP  ;; # Ignore for compatibility.
                  p)      pipeline="$pipeline | $PIC" ;;
                  r)      pipeline="$pipeline | $REFER" ;;
                  t)      pipeline="$pipeline | $TBL" ;;
                  v)      pipeline="$pipeline | $VGRIND" ;;
                  *)      usage ;;
                  esac

(I copied all this from 2014 text, do not ask me no questions.)
It would make very much sense to extend this syntax for roff
usage, so that document creators can define how manual consumers
generate the result.  This should/could include specification and
thus automatic adjustment of the used character set.
The problem with pipes is that they are academic.  You can write
wrapper scripts or shell functions or for simple cases even
aliases to give the desire a name, but it does not fit pretty well
the all-graphical shader-improved wiping experience people now
have.  You also want good manuals and a shell with a good history
feature and a nice line editor and possibly tabulator completion,
just in case you have forgotten something or made an error or are
too lazy to type that much.
