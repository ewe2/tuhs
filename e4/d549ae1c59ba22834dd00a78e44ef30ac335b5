​ditto, Pascal and Mod-II and Mod-III were pretty slick.   They were a
little wordy compared to C, but I admit the programs we wrote in them "just
worked" and I can not think any security issues in any that we wrote.

But Ches, that leaves the open question of what to teach?   My daughter
loves it and that's what college taught her, but I cringe when I look at
what she and her peeps do with Python.   To me that's more like shell
scripting.   Maybe its my inner curmudgeon showing.

I have not seen anything like Clancy's "Oh Pascal" book in the key of Go,
much less Brinch Hansen's "Java for Everyone" ​which I still think are two
of the best teaching text out there.
