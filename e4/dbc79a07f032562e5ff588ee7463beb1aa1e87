Thank you for sharing this work, most impressive!

Are you sure? Could it perhaps be SVR2? (I don=E2=80=99t see any STREAMS =
stuff that one would expect for R3).

> The interesting feature of this kernel is the integration of the
> Newcastle Connection network

One of my interests is Unix (packet) networking 1975-1985 and that =
includes Newcastle Connection. I=E2=80=99ve so far not dived deep into =
this, but your work may be the trigger for some further investigation.

My understanding so far (from reading the paper a few years ago) is that =
Newcastle Connection works at the level of libc, substituting  system =
calls like open() and exec() with library routines that scan the path, =
and if it is a network path invokes user mode routines that use remote =
procedure calls to give the illusion of a networked kernel. I=E2=80=99ve =
briefly looked at the Git repo, but I do not see that structure in the =
code. Could you elaborate a bit more on how Newcastle Connection =
operates in this kernel? Happy to communicate off-list if it goes in too =
much detail.

I note that the repo Readme says that the kernel only does some basic IP =
networking as a carrier, but I also see some files in the tree that seem =
to implement a form of tcp (and that seem unrelated to the early Unix =
tcp/ip=E2=80=99s that I have seen so far). Or am I reading too much into =
these files?

=3D=3D=3D

Re-reading the Newcastle Connection paper also brought up some citations =
from Bell Labs work that seems to have been lost. There is a reference =
to =E2=80=9CRIDE=E2=80=9D which appears to be a system similar to =
Newcastle Connection. The RIDE paper is from 1979 and it mentions that =
RIDE is a Datakit re-implementation of earlier an earlier system that =
ran on Spider. Any recollections about these things among the TUHS =
readership?

The other citation is for J. C. Kaufeld and D. L. Russell, "Distributed =
UNIX System", in Workshop on Fundamental Issues in Distributed =
Computing, ACM SIGOPS and SIGPLAN (15-17 Dec. 1980). It seems =
contemporaneous with the Luderer/Marshall/Chu work on S/F-Unix. I could =
not find this paper so far. Here, too, any recollections about this =
distributed Unix among the TUHS readership?
