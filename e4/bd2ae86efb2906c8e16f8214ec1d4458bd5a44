I just found out about TUHS today; I plan to skim the archives RSN to =
get some context.  Meanwhile, this note is a somewhat long-winded =
introduction, followed by a (non-monetary) sales pitch.  I think some of =
the introduction may be interesting and/or relevant to the pitch, but =
YMMV...

Introduction

In 1970, I was introduced to programming by a cabal of social science =
professors at SF State College.  They had set up a lab space with a few =
IBM 2741 (I/O Selectric) terminals, connected by dedicated lines to =
Stanford's Wylbur system.  I managed to wangle a spot as a student =
assistant and never looked back.  I also played a tiny bit with a PDP-12 =
in a bio lab and ran one (1) program on SFSC's "production system", an =
IBM 1620 Mark II (yep; it's a computer...).

While a student, I actually got paid to work with a CDC 3150, a DEC =
PDP-15, and (once) on an IBM 360/30.  After that, I had some Real Jobs: =
assembler on a Varian 620i and a PDP-11, COBOL on an IBM mainframe, =
Fortran on assorted CDC and assorted DEC machines, etc.

By the late 80's, my personal computers were a pair of aging LSI-11's, =
running RT-11.  At work (Naval Research Lab, in DC), I was mostly using =
TOPS-10 and Vax/VMS.  I wanted to upgrade my home system and knew that I =
wanted all the cool stuff: a bit-mapped screen, multiprocessing, virtual =
memory, etc.

There was no way I could afford to buy this sort of setup from DEC, but =
my friend Jim Joyce had been telling me about Unix for a few years, so I =
attended the Boston USENIX in 1982 (sharing a cheap hotel room with Dick =
Karpinski :-) and wandered around looking at the workstation offerings.  =
I made a bet on Sun (buying stock would have been far more lucrative, =
but also more risky and less fun) and ended up buying Sun #285 from John =
Gage.

At one point, John was wandering around Sun, asking for a slogan that =
Sun could use on a conference button to indicate how they differed from =
the competition.  I suggested "The Joy of Unix", which he immediately =
adopted.  This decision wasn't totally appreciated by some USENIX =
attendees from Murray Hill, who printed up (using troff, one presumes) =
and wore individualized paper badges proclaiming themselves as "The =
<whatever> of Unix".  Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery... =
(bows)

IIRC, I received my Sun-1 late in a week (of course :-), but managed to =
set it up with fairly little pain.  I got some help on the weekend from =
someone named Bill, who happened to be in the office on the weekend ... =
seemed quite competent ... I ran for a position on the Sun User Group =
board, saying that I would try to protect the interests of the "smaller" =
users.  I think I was able to do some good in that position, not least =
because I was able to get John Gilmore and the Sun lawyers to agree on a =
legal notice, edit some SUGtapes, etc.

Later on, I morphed this effort into Prime Time Freeware, which produced =
book/CD collections of what is now called Open Source software.  Back =
when there were trade magazines, I also wrote a few hundred articles for =
Unix Review, SunExpert, etc.  Of course, I continue to play (happily) =
with computers...

Perkify

If you waded through all of that introduction, you'll have figured out =
that I'm a big fan of making libre software more available, usable, etc. =
 This actually leads into Perkify, one of my current projects.  Perkify =
is (at heart) a blind-friendly virtual machine, based on Ubuntu, =
Vagrant, and VirtualBox.  As you might expect, it has a strong emphasis =
on text-based programs, which Unix (and Linux) have in large quantities.

However, Perkify's charter has expanded quite a bit.  At some point, I =
realized that (within limits) there was very little point to worrying =
about how big the Vagrant "box" became.  After all, a couple of dozen GB =
of storage is no longer an issue, and having a big VM on the disk (or =
even running) doesn't slow anything down.  So, the current distro weighs =
in at about 10 GB and 4,000 or so APT packages (mostly brought in as =
dependencies or recommendations).  Think of it as "a well-equipped =
workshop, just down the hall".  For details, see:

Sales Pitch

I note that assorted folks on this list are trying to dig up copies of =
Ken's Space Travel program.  Amusingly, I was making the same search =
just the other day.  However, finding software that can be made to run =
on Ubuntu is only part of the challenge I face; I also need to come up =
APT (or whatever) packages that Just Work when I add them to the =
distribution.

So, here's the pitch.  Help me (and others) to create packages for use =
in Perkify and other Debian-derived distros.  The result will be =
software that has reliable repos, distribution, etc.  It may also help =
the code to live on after you and I are no longer able (or simply =
interested enough) to keep it going.
