Other names:

Duane Adams formed the committee. He was DARPA's first VLSI program 
manager and then the Deputy Director of ARPA's Information Processing 
Techniques Office (IPTO).

Colonel Robert Baker, the R&D Program Manager for DARPA's Distributed 
Computing Program later became DARPA's representative on the steering 
committee.

Are Adams and Baker excluded because they weren't technical 
participants?

Mike Karels later joined.

and I was told that Mike O'Brien represented CSNET.

Or maybe the "steering committee" terminology was still used as this 
morphed into the Dave Clark (of MIT) led meetings?
