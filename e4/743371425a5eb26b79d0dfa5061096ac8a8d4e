Digging through some records it looks like the $70,000 cash investment from
ARDC hit DEC on July 1, so the corporate birthday must have been slightly
earlier.

I have the 1957 date in several books (the publication of which predate
Wikipedia).     There's a document in Alan Earls's book that is the lease
for DEC's first office space, dated August 27, 1957.   Other information I
have just says they took the venture money and founded DEC that summer.

But no actual date, sadly...  Anyone know for sure?  I maintain a list of
geeky things like this (and no, I don't necessarily trust Wikipedia, as it's
only as accurate as the last person who edited it).
