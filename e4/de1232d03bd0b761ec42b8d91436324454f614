Well, the source code for the fuzzball version of PING[1a] calls it
"P i n g - packet inter net groper".

The fuzzball manual[1b] calls it:

	The Packet InterNet Groper (PING) is an internet measurement and
	debugging tool.

Mills's 1983 RFC889[2] calls the original PING Packet InterNet Groper.

There is his claim[3] he invented it in 1979.

Where it seems Muus preferred to keep the sonar analogy pure for ping(8)
Mills liked to play with words all the time.
