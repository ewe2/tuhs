I wonder if that inspired the AUSAM buffer management?  The current buffer 
header was "b" (like "u") which got mapped by KISA5.

For the first time I was able to avoid our 11/40 deadlocking; I can't 
remember all the devices that were on it, but there were a *lot* 
(including the printer driver etc which used the buffer pool, not the 
character queue).
