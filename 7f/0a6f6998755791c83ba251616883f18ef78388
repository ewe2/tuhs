we all know that UNIX first ran on the PDP-7 and then on the PDP-11/20,
but does anyone know anything about PDP-9 UNIX?  it\'s mentioned in \"The
UNIX Time-Sharing System\" in the V7 manual:

\"The earliest [version of UNIX] (circa 1969-70) ran on the Digital
Equipment Corporation PDP-7 and -9 computers.\"
