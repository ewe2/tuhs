My ADM has unebelievably noisy flyback whine. I can't stand it. I turn
it on, to remind myself why I turned it off.

my ASR33 got dropped in the last office move. its silent, perforce,
for the forseeable, probably ever. its also 22ma currentloop which was
always going to be hard to patch into things. (I think it has a 232
option too, didn't look)
