Message-ID: <20030617.140440.74753453.akito_fujita@mvg.biglobe.ne.jp>

Hi

I have a plan to run UNIX/32V using SIMH.

UNIX/32V is required VAX-11/780 
and SIMH support Micro VAX III (?) only.
Is it possible without any modification ?

Does anyone try this ?
Are there more better emulator than SIMH ?
or Should I add the feature of 11/780 emulation into SIHM ?

Thanks
