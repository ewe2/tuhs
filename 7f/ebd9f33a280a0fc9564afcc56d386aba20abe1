Not any longer - I tried it again with

u.u_dirp.l = (caddr_t)(((long)uap->linkname) & 0x7F00FFFF);

and it seems to work now - no idea what went wrong the last time
I tried it.

#1 rm /z/tmp/*
#2 echo "test" > /z/tmp/hugo
#3 ln /z/tmp/hugo /z/tmp/walter
ls#4  -li /z/tmp
total 2
  2452 -rw-rw-rw- 2 wega     system        5 Nov 15 02:44 hugo
  2452 -rw-rw-rw- 2 wega     system        5 Nov 15 02:44 walter
#5

I still have direct modification of rr2 and not the copy to rr4,
so if I would aim for binary equalness it is still not the same,
but it seems that it can't be done another way.
