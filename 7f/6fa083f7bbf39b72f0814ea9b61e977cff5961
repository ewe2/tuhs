We did something similar in BitKeeper but we added a spicy little twist.
We encoded len and cap in one word by making cap increase in powers of
2 only (which means you need log(n) bits for cap).  So it was a data
structure that scaled both up and down.

We used it everywhere in BitKeeper, it was super handy.
