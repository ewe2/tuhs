Not quite a dmr anecdote, but maybe this list can clear up a statement =
that dmr reputedly made: =E2=80=9Cstreams means something different when =
shouted=E2=80=9D.
I think the claim goes back to around the turn of the millennium and as =
far as I know it is not disputed that dmr either said this or could have =
said this.

Now, from reading this list over the years my understanding of the above =
statement is that dmr designed streams as a mechanism to clean up the =
kernel handling of line disciplines in a context of access via a =
terminal and/or modem, and that STREAMS developed this into a way to =
integrate network stacks with the kernel =E2=80=94 hence streams meant =
something different when shouted.

The original dmr paper (1984) on streams =
(http://cm.bell-labs.co/who/dmr/st.html) seemed to support this =
understanding, focussing on terminal handling in its discussion. Also, =
near the end it says: "Streams are linear connections; by themselves, =
they support no notion of multiplexing, fan-in or fan-out. [...] It =
seems likely that a general multiplexing mechanism could help in both =
cases, but again, I do not yet know how to design it.=E2=80=9D This =
seemed to exclude usage for networking, which is typically multiplexed.

However, now that the V8 sources are available it is clear that the =
streams mechanism was used (by dmr?) to implement TCP/IP networking. He =
explains how that tallies with the above quote on multiplexing in a 1985 =
usenet post: =
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topicsearchin/net.unix-wizards/subject$3=
Astreams/net.unix-wizards/b7W_j_0qASU
(if the post by dmr does not immediately appear, click on the 8-10-85 =
post by 'd...@dutoit.uucp=E2=80=99 to make it fold out: this is the =
message I refer to).

The way I read this usenet post, dmr was actually reasonably content =
with implementing a network stack on top of (lowercase) streams. This =
then implies that he was alluding to something else when saying =
=E2=80=9Cstreams means something different when shouted=E2=80=9D (or =
maybe he never said it).

Any opinions on what he might have meant?
