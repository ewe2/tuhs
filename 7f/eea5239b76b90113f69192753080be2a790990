The UNIX Assembler Reference Manual winds up as 10 printed pages, the 
as(I) page is, well, as you put it, 1 page, printed. Both are a bit thin 
by my reckoning. :). That said, Lions words about assembly are pretty 
few, too. But, he is addressing an aspect that was not addressed in 
either of the manual's entries and is very helpful for making the 
translation between PDP-11 Macro Assembler and unix as.
