A few inaccuracies:

    When the operating system grew too big to fit on the first RK05 disk
    pack (their root filesystem) they let it leak into the second one,
    which is where all the user home directories lived (which is why
    the mount was called /usr).  They replicated all the OS directories
    under there (/bin, /sbin, /lib, /tmp...) and wrote files to those
    new directories because their original disk was out of space.
    When they got a third disk, they mounted it on /home and relocated
    all the user directories to there so the OS could consume all the
    space on both disks and grow to THREE WHOLE MEGABYTES (ooooh!).

Research Unix never had /sbin nor /home, and the tale of the third disk
doesn't ring any bells to me.

7th Edition has /usr/dmr and /usr/ken, not /home/dmr nor /usr/home/dmr :)

Cheers,
