Too easy :-)

Re the simulator, a former boss suggested (when these things were rife) 
that the BEL character could only be outputted by "root", and if you 
didn't hear "ding", well...

I (and likely others) worked around them by deliberating typing a wrong 
password (the kiddies were rarely smart enough to loop a couple of times 
or to test it), and I was glad when I started working there and had my own 
terminal (OK, a shared one in our office).
