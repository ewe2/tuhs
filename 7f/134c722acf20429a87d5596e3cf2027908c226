Time here is round 14:00 UTC+11.  UTC time is 3:00, so UTC+11 = 14:00
makes sense to me.  UTC-11 = 14:00 doesn't.

A thing that nobody has mentioned, and for which I can't find a
reference easily: didn't System V have time zone offsets the wrong way
round?  I have some recollection from about 1988.
