I recall that there was an attempt to do this with the Linux kernel,
but that it was abandoned before it was completed, this would have
been pre '98. Probably pre 2.4 Kernel.

I have vague memories of discussions about it on the (kernel) mailing
list at the time, and that it was the original cause of the 'asmlinkage'
annotation on the C level syscalls - basically to turn off C++ name
mangling for when the assembler syscall table referenced the C routines.
