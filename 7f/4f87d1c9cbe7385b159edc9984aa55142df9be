Well, the II kinda was.  Not by the time of the //gs, which, if you were =
writing C, was probably the one you were using.  By then it had a =
windowing system and complications.  And then the Mac, prior to OS X, =
yeah, not intended for the end user to be a software developer.

But the II/II+/IIe were all straightforward machines.  As long as you =
wanted to write BASIC or 6502 assembly they were reasonably =
programmer-friendly (I say, as someone who couldn=E2=80=99t afford =
Merlin, the real assembler of the day, at that point, and did his =
assembly by hand, so, yeah, maybe not THAT friendly).  Once you learned =
what the zero page addresses were for in the particular OS/ROM BASIC you =
were running, it was a pretty intelligible system.

=E2=80=A6.and now having done a little googling, there was indeed an =
Aztec C for Apple II DOS 3.3 in 1982.  If that was what you were using, =
well, yep, looks like you had to use its editor, but the sample program =
(slightly more complex than =E2=80=9CHello world") looks pretty much =
like it would have in any other C (interestingly, no #include <stdio.h> =
needed):

main(argc, argv)
int argc;
char *argv[];
{
  register int i =3D 1;

  printf("Program <%s> has %d arguments\n", argv[0], argc-l);
  while (--argc) {
    printf("Arg %d =3D <%s>\n", i, argv[i]);
    i++;
  }
}
So I=E2=80=99m guessing you were using something for the //gs plus =
GS/OS.
