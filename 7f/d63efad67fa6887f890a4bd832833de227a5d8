Maybe I've missed something, but I'm in the intermediate camp.  Emacs
is in my fingertips, and I wouldn't want to live without it, but I'd
far rather see info go away.  In some ways it anticipated HTML, but I
find navigation particularly painful.

It's linear.

Yes, but you need to follow the link manually.  Theoretically a good
HTML document would be better, but it's nice to have a linear form
that you can search.

For an extreme case of man pages, look at something like mplayer(1) or
mpv(1):

  $ man mplayer|wc -l
     9435
  $ man mpv|wc -l
     13939

That doesn't make them easy to read.
