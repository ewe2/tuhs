Back in those days, there didn't exist any process limits, except for 
system wide ones... :-)

Another fun exercise that actually hurts systems today, but didn't hurt 
much back then, are programs that allocate a large chunk of memory and 
hit on a single address on each page repetedly.

Talk about thrashing the memory system... :-) But on the PDP-11, you 
don't use demand paging, nor can you allocate that much memory.
