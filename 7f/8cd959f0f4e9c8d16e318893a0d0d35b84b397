Well, it would be nice to know what you're really trying to do.
What's the hardware?  If the file system is UFS, it's unlikely to be a
good fit for Linux.  I'd say "try FreeBSD", but without knowing more
about your software and hardware, it's not clear if that would be any
better.  Google suggests that it runs on ARMs.  Is that correct?

In that case you should copy us.
