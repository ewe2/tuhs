Subject: [TUHS] Archive of old ;login or EUUG newsletters?
Message-ID: <20140614033019.GA16666@www.oztivo.net>

Speaking of old publications, is there an on-line archive of old ;login:
or EUUG newsletters? I did one for the AUUG newsletters here:

http://minnie.tuhs.org/Archive/Documentation/AUUGN/

but it would be nice to have an archive for the U.S and Europe.

Cheers,
