You know that Linux implements several different competing methods to access 
these drive types?

You know that some of them do not (or not correctly) support DMA?

You know that DVD drives will not work for writing if you do not have DMA?

Why do people always repeat the same questions that have been answered many 
times in the past already?

1)	CAM is a standard, why not use it? full stop

2)	**Most** Operating systems do not support /dev/* based access to SCSI.
	This includes a POSIX certified system like Mac OS X.

3)	**Most** Operating systems do not even support a file descriptor based
	interface to SCSI commands.
	This includes a POSIX certified system like Mac OS X.

4)	CAM is the only interface method that can be mapped to all
	existing operating system specific implementations.
