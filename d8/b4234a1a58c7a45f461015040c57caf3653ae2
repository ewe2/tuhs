Hello from Gregg C Levine
Okay, now this begs the question: Can the VAX Station boot code which
is targeted to that specific system, be rewritten to accommodate the
VAX processor that SIMH emulates? I am not a good C programmer, just a
whatever comes before that. I can only offer these suggestions, and
ask these questions. 

For that matter, do any of us have any of the SUN hardware that I do
know Sprite ran on? Or that VAX Station? For me, its no to all three.
