Can't speak for the *source trees* them themselves more than I have
already, as they came from all over - BL Research, USL, IBM itself, ISC,
LCC, UCB, CMU, MIT, etc...; but IBM negotiated a very extensive *SVR3
license* with AT&T and and marketed it primarily an System V based system
with "BSD & IBM specfic enhancements".

This license agreement was the basis for AIX shipments as well as all OSF
shipments.  While other places covered it, if you google around for
articles from "Unigram/X"(Maureen O'Garia's crew) in the years of 1990-2000
in particular  you should find a number of articles that described the
transactions and how it effected the "Unix Industry."
