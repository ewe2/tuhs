(I think its mentioned in an earlier post already).  I copy the
files to my 7ed system (make a tar, put it on a tape image, and
attach it in simh, then tar x to get contents).  Probably easier
if you're using apout and local filesystem...  I'm using the following
script (in my tools but not checked in because I'm using nonstandard
conv2):

    tools/rebuild
    (cd rebuilt; gtar -O -cf ../u.tar u?.s)
    ./conv2 -o tape.tm u.tar
    cp tape.tm ~/work/simh/unix-v7-4/run/

Anyway to assemble I run:

     as - sys.s u0.s u1.s ux.s

btw, I noticed some unicode characters in the files you committed.
I havent' had a chance to spend time editing it yet..  The ocr
often uses unicode for things like "-".

a.out is so simple, it wouldnt be hard to reproduce if we had to.

I noticed that.  Thank you.
