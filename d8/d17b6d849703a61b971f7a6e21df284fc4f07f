I sometimes use style and diction tools from GNU project. (I have some 
enhancements I need to share back.)

The video also mentioned "proofer" from WWB. Where can I find the 
Writer's Workbench (WWB) tools like proofr, punct, double, splitinf, 
prose, findbe, abst, org, and maybe others?  (It would be nice if there 
were some maintained versions that I can use on NetBSD now, but if not 
I could port them as needed.)
