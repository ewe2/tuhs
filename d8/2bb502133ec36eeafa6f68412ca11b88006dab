Hi Gleb,

thanks for your pointer, unfortunatelly this is NOT the right one, as there
was two Venix distributions:

- PRO/Venix 2.0 (this one is by DEC, the one I also own)
- Venix/PRO 1.x, 2,x (this one by VenturCom).

Your pointer is for the second one, while I'm asking for the first one.
Thanks a lot for your kind answer.

Franco.
