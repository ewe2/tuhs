SunOS 4.x shipped RFS, Howard Chartok (my office mate at the time) did
the port I believe.  Thankless work since Sun ran their entire campus
on NFS; RFS never got any attention.  It's too bad because it did solve
some problems that NFS just punted on.  NFS is Clem's law in action,
it was good enough, not great, but still won.
