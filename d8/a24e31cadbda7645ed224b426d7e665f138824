Does anyone out there have a machine or a tape?  I'm looking for the 
lint libraries I wrote, there were posix, psd, xpg*, etc.  I was pretty
focussed, back in the day, on making it easy for people to write code
that could port easily.  These days nobody cares about that stuff but
I'd like a copy of those lint libs.  If you don't get why think about
how hard it is to care if it is a char* or a void* or an int or a long.

Thanks,
