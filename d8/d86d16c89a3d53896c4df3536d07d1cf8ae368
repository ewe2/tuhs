Subject: [TUHS] Change of IP address for tuhs.org mail server
Message-ID: <20121116035023.GA4212@www.oztivo.net>

All, I've had to move my machine minnie.tuhs.org out from where I work
at Bond University. The new IP address is 65.49.60.197. I've updated the
A and MX DNS records but they are still propagating. If you have any
future troubles sending e-mail to tuhs at tuhs.org, contact me at wkt at tuhs.org.
And if that fails, try my Gmail account "warren.toomey" :)

Cheers,
	Warren
