Possible?  Yes.  Convenient?  No.

You could cat several uuencode files together and send them in one 
email.  You'd have to edit them on the receiving end into separate files 
and uudecode them separately.  In practice, you'd uuencode a tarball.

MIME was a major advance, and what's telling is that 25 years later, 
SMTP/MIME is still the standard.
