More the former than the latter.

Mach entered the commercial world by way of NeXT, and there were a few
other more or less production versions, such as the mt. Xinu one and
MachTen (IIRC), but Mach never really caught on big. (There was even
a port of Linux on top of Mach at some point.)

Mach survives today in the kernel of Mac OS X (Darwin), but I think that's
about it.

Rick Rashid, who was the guiding professor for Mach, went to Microsoft
Research, and as far as I can tell, fell off the radar screen for OS
development work. (Anyone who knows different feel free to correct me.)
