Wes Ã°u hal Wesley,

On Sunday, February 29, 2004, 7:34:03 AM, ure freond feorran awrat: 

WP> I know the SCO topic's been done to death, and all, but I was thinking about
WP> the Microsoft purchase of a Unix license (apparently) for their MS SFU
WP> (Windows Services For Unix) which contrary to the plain meaning of the name,
WP> is essentially a Unix (apparently OpenBSD, according to rumour) box on top of
WP> the Windows kernel and Win32 API.

WP> The question is, wouldn't that put Microsoft and the SCO Group in breach of
WP> the settlement between AT&T and Berkeley?  If Win SFU _is_ OpenBSD, and
WP> Microsoft have bought a license to run it from the SCO Group of all people,
WP> isn't that in effect picking a fight with Theo de Raadt?

There are a few OpenBSD CVS tags in libc.a as well.

However, there are no BSD-style copyright notices in any of the header
files, only this:

$ pwd ; grep -i OpenBSD *
/usr/include
string.h:/* strncat(), strncpy() replacements from OpenBSD/FreeBsd */

This leads me to suspect that BSD isn't the base for libc or the
include files.

Maybe BSD is the base for /bin, /usr/bin etc.

As SFU doesn't have a kernel, this is probably either based on Xenix,
or some other companies attempt at a UNIX emulation layer (note the
copyrights to Softway Systems Inc.)
