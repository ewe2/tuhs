Oh, we'll just ask Oracle for a license 'for all parts of SunOS for which they
have the ability to grant a licence'.

There's no way I'd want them to have to chase down all the corner cases,
that's just a way to guarantee it will never happen. I'd want to ask for the
bare minimum of time/effort on their part.

Anything above that, probably the SCCS stuff would be next on the priority
list, sounds like.
