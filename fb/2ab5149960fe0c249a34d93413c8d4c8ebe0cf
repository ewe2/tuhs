Well, there is an impio.c in the BBN TCP code which has #define NCPs, which
I used to rebuild the original impio.c; although this is very much a devil
in the
details situation.

I do need to do a readthrough for the VDH driver, which says its for "very
distant hosts".
I think that might be for the radio links to Hawaii and the UK? I vaguely
remember coming
across that term in my reading, but I'm drawing a blank ATM.

I did try to run the unix binaries in green and green47, but they seem to
be configured
for a RL0x drive of some sort; the driver is in the NOSC source, so it
might be possible
to get running, but without the host binaries, you'r enot going to get far.

Well, I'm not sure if its trying to initialize the IMP on startup; there's
a userspace daemon,
ncpd which talks to the /dev nodes to do stuff; with network nodes showing
up as /dev/net/*host.

I did determine I at least seem to make it to sched() with my home cooked
kernel, but I can't even
start in single user mode.

Honestly, it reminds me of Plan 9 more than anything.

Will do. ITS feels like an extremely deep (if interesting) rabbithole :)

Yup, that's what I figured. I've been trying to evaluate how much survives
here, but
my general feeling is one of the UNIX stacks might be recoverable, plus the
ARPA
stuff in ITS. I don't know if a runnable build of TENEX has been archived,
or if ARPA
stuff for TOPS-10/20 survived.

I also want to look into System/360 and 370, but I get the sense none of
the mainframe stuff survived.

The other problem is of the surviving stacks, they all seem to be for the
later 96-bit leader,
I'm not certain if any of the IMP software that has been archived is new
enough to work with that.

That said, that isn't an insurmountable problem.
