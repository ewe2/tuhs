Subject: [Unix-jun72] SIMH V3.8-0 released: KE11A and DC11 added
Message-ID: <20080625013712.GA8898@minnie.tuhs.org>

All Simh version 3.8-0 has been released by Bob Supnik. It now has all the
support that we need to run 1st Edition UNIX. In our Subversion repository,
I've updated the Readme file and the simh.cfg file to match the new simulator.

Cheers,
