I doubt that, for the reasons I posted to the list.

I'm working on one, little by little. But I have pretty much zero docs
on the ND-500(0) side of the things, as well as the interface between
the ND-100 and ND-500(0) processors.

I believe they were plasma screens, and emulated a pair of standard
TDV-22xx serial terminals (the OS did AFAIK not support the huge
framebuffer natively).
The writer of the original version in Norwegian has all parts of the
Technostation apart from the giant desk.

Which museum? Did you include the funny desk? Was it running when you
gave it up? What software did it run?

I personally have a ND-5700 computer, and would of course *kill* for
ENQUIRE. :)

http://toresbe.at.ifi.uio.no/technostation.jpeg offers a more detailed
view of the console. The article is in Norwegian, about the machine
winning a design award.
