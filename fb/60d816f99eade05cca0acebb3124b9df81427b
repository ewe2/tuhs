Subject: [TUHS] off-topic: RS232C standard
Message-ID: <CAFZPMoZ3aSxH48M7b74v-ggZTGoe+-A-NPRyCjmVog=uhHiiNw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all!
Sorry for slightly off-topic question, but do anybody have a copy of
original circa 1969 RS232C standard? I need it to resolve conflict with me
and my customer regarding if RS-232C REQUIRES the use of DE-25M connector
or just
RECOMMENDS it? It seems that there is a lot of interpretations of this
standard, but
no original document anywhere :(

I know it might cost $$$, but I will pay all needed fees.

All the best,
S.
