As a similar feature, Joy's experimental "ashell" in the first BSD had a 
feature to run Pascal objects (started with the magic 0404 octal word) 
with the px interpreter. In 2BSD (and then 3BSD), his new csh had the 
OTHERSH feature -- if it started with # it would use csh; if the script 
did not begin with the # it would use /bin/sh.

I still don't see the same #! feature, but the above appear they may be 
inspiration. Also the 1BSD and 2BSD predate CSRG.
