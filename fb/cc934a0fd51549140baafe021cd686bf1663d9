Rob - Fair enough/excellent point/I agree from a pure technology stand
point, but the problem was anything from Research after Seventh Edition was
the limited availability so few people out side really used it (and I'll
have include Plan 9 in that family also - although you guys did get it out
more widely than 8th or 10th UNIX -- funny by that point, I had read about
it and seen the manuals in a book store in the UK, but I did not get the
mess with the actual 10th edition code until  a few years after I had a
Plan 9 boot floppy that Dave gave me running in a laptop).
