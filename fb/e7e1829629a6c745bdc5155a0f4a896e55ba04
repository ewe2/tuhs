(=E2=80=98Unix: A History & Memoir=E2=80=99)=20

Doug McIlroy has commented on v2-v3 (1972-73?) being an extremely =

There=E2=80=99s at least one Internet meme that highly productive coders =
necessarily have good keyboard skills,
which leads to also producing documentation or, at least, not avoiding =
it entirely, as often happens commercially.

Underlying this is something I once caught as a random comment:

	The commonality of skills between Writing & Coding.

Does anyone has any good refs for this crossover?
Is it a real effect or a biased view.

CC (v2 page 52)

V2 saw a burst of languages:
    a new TMG,=20
    a B that worked in both core-resident and software-paged versions,
    the completion of Fortran IV (Thompson and Ritchie), and
    Ritchie's first C, conceived as B with data types.

In that furiously productive year Thompson and Ritchie together
    wrote and debugged about
    100,000 lines of production code.

Programming's Dirtiest Little Secret

et.html>

	It's just simple arithmetic. If you spend more time hammering =
out code, then in order to keep up, you need to spend less time doing =
something else.

	But when it comes to programming, there are only so many things =
you can sacrifice!=20
	You can cut down on your documentation.=20
	You can cut down on commenting your code.=20
	You can cut down on email conversations and=20
		participation in online discussions, preferring group =
discussions and hallway conversations.

	And... well, that's about it.

	So guess what non-touch-typists sacrifice?=20
	All of it, man.=20
	They sacrifice all of it.

	Touch typists can spot an illtyperate programmer from a mile =
away.=20
	They don't even have to be in the same room.

	For starters, non-typists are almost invisible.=20
	They don't leave a footprint in our online community.
