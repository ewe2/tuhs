The Bell Labs 370 port was different, it was based on running inside of
TSS/370, which was an IBM OS which hardly anyone besides Bells's ESS group
used.

Clem can tell us all about the IBM/Locus port to the 370.  And maybe there
was another IBM port??

Much later, Sun ported Solaris to the Hitachi HDS 370 clones (for Hitachi),
and then to Amdahl clones for Amdahl/Fujitsu.
