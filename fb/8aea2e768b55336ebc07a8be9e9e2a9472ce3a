All,
	Just a message to say that the PUPS mailing list DOES exist :-)
It's just very quiet, so please feel free to wake it up. I should
send in a list of new things in the PUPS Archive.

We now have:
	152 people subscribed to the mailing list
	100 people with access to the PUPS archive
	1502 SCO Ancient Unix license holders.

Finally, John Dodson in Australia (who is not on the list), asked
me to forward this message to you all.

Cheers,
	Warren

Free to a good home...

	Complete set of RSX11-M manuals. (Yes it ran on a PDP11 ;-)

	Complete set of Ultrix manuals. (Oh Ok so it ran on Vaxes ;-)

	One or 2 PDP-11/23's + some i/o cards (I'm not making a list, YOU must
			look, decide & negotiate with me to let them go...)
			A volunteer prepared to make a list would be OK.

Well as the list does live (a bit) let me introduce myself, maybe I can get
out some discussion.

My name is Wim Fournier (for known people and friends (not that I have any)
it's Wimpie).
I'm a student of 19 years old and currently doing Technical Informatics...
That is something like system engineer with much knowledge.
I'm higly interrested in electronics; High Frequency radio; computers;
computer hardware; Old stuf (audio/compu/etc);unix/Linux

I own a PDP11/94 with modem-lines / dr11c / tu80 / etc
I have not got it working yet (hacking!!!)
It's from the dutch telecom company KPN who has used it for semaphone
(beepers and stuff) It came with a 19" rack (all black + heavy) and a switch
box for American plugs.
When I put the box and the PDP on power and switch on the switch and set it to
local on or power on, only the switch goes on... the PDP does not react.. I
have got one suspect: the wire between the switch and the PDP (3-wire in the
back)... it was broken and I re-wire it 1 on 1 but do not know if this is OK.

Further more I haven't got a disk yet. I'm searching for an old apple disk
(scsi-1) as someone told me it should work. 

If someone has got an answer to my frustrating problems.. I'm listening.. 8*}

Well... that will be the end of this shout for help plus introduction.. 

Greetings,

Wim Fournier

Unix Support Netherlands (practice training company for my study)

PS: sorry for the bad English if any.. My keyboard doesn't type English that
good... 8*))

That's a good one.. I saw the breaker.. it's holding the floor of the pdp..
But what I'm wordering is what the power consumption is (at 220V) in ampere,
because I will be feeding it from an normal home-socket (line/null/mass) at
+/- 230Volt 10 Ampere.

Well.. I didn't get the test plugs.. but that's OK.. I'll nuke them myself 8*)
And as of the power controller cables.. How much does it cost to send from
your house (where do you live anyway?) to The Netherlands (I live near Utrecht
(about the center of NL))

1502 SCO Ancient Unix license holders!  (Or is it 152?)

Wow, that's $150,000 to SCO for supporting the effort.
That should probably be enough to pay all the lawyers, etc.
(Even if it's only $15,000.)  I hope Warren got a cut, too.  :)
