31 years ago almost to the day, I stayed up until 01:30 PST to write a
description of all of the networks I knew of in response to a query on the
HUMAN-NETS mailing list; it appears under the subject "The Plethora of
Networks" in HUMAN-NETS digest V7 #1 which can be found:

http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~cwm/NetStuff/Human-Nets/Volume7.html

A number of others also chimed in, and the resulting discussion inspired (and
was source material for) John S. Quarterman's book "The Matrix" (1989):

It's a bit of a budgie-killer, but a fine snapshot of what was at that time.
