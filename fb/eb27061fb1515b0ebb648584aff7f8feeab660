Sorry, no help there, I'm reading it as history too. I've just looked
through a lot of the (at least publicly available) historical versions
of the termcap/terminfo stuff in particular, and I looked for VT05
descriptions in particular since it seemed odd to me that even the
modern ncurses terminfo doesn't contain a description for it when it
includes so many other DEC terminals.
