Also from what little I know, that's a decent analogy.

Bear in mind that said terminals were wired directly to the peripheral
controller, usually within the same building, in cable conduits under the
floor, in the ceiling overhead or in various combinations thereof.  It
wasn't TCP/IP over wireless!

Moving the interaction with the human into a peripheral made a lot of
sense; you often had dozens or hundreds of the terminals hooked up to
the mainframes, and the interrupt per single-character model of Unix
and other minicomputer OSes would have brought a mainframe to its knees,
crying like a baby.
