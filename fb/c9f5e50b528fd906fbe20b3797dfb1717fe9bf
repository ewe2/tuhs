Hi all,
	I thought I'd better send in a message to the PUPS list just to
shake out the cobwebs, and to welcome on the newest half-dozen subscribers.

I've added some more disk space, memory and a new OS to the PUPS Archive
machine, minnie. About 100 people now have access to the archive, and SCO
has sold 166 Ancient UNIX licenses.

Peter Chubb recently mentioned that Dennis Ritchie has unearthed some old
C compilers (see http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/primevalC.html). I'll
add them into the Archive soon, and perhaps even try to compile them with
the 5th Edition compiler.

As always, if you have any questions etc. about old Unixes, please drop
them into this mailing list.

Cheers,
	Warren
