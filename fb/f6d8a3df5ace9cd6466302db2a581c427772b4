Hello!
If it helps atll  the strange people at Ibib managed to rescue the
collection that was running on the Linux distro side of the house, and
it's stored in their historic-linux directory.. Oh and the very early
Slackware stuff is available on the mirror of Slackware's FTP site on
the Mirror Services site at ftp.mirrorservice.org. Incidentally a very
early mirror of the TSX site is also inside that historic-linux
directory.

Well it=E2=80=99s the start of adding 3rd parties code and G++ stuff as wel=
