This sounds like a Digital BA-11 of some sort. It could be something  
as early as a pdp 11/20, 11/05, 11/34, 11/35, or as late as a 11/24  
or 11/44 -- possibly others.

Not easy or cheap. It's bulky, heavy and would usually require 2  
persons to move around. I've moved various of my pdp11s around and  
it's always been hard work. Stashing a case of beer in the bottom of  
an H960 is good incentive for assistants.
