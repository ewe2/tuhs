Thanks for the reply. The nroff source for a lot of these is indeed on

it to pdf or ps?

In v6:
# cd /usr/doc/iolib
# nroff iolib

...
pected  to make any sense of it on retlrn.  The first arglment is

Mangled. But when I took the source and copied it onto my mac and did this:
groff -t iolib
ps2pdf iolib.ps

reasonable?
