My belief is that perl was written to replace a lot of Unix pipelines,
which are awesome when you discover them but less awesome as they become
complex (error handling in a pipeline is pretty tricky if you actually
want to handle stuff nicely).

I was a huge fan of Perl 4, still am, wrote a source management system 
in it while at Sun.  It wanted you to be pretty disciplined in how you
wrote it or it becomes write only, but if you are, it was really pleasant.
