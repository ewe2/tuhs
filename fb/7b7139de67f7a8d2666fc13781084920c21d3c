Terminal editing was done in general on the Blit and follow-on systems.
That's primarily why the Research shells didn't do it.

But history (ha!) chose another path.

    8th ed sh (about &#39;84) brought quite a few changes and fixes. Just
    naming a few:<br>
    - environment variable HISTORY, pointing to a writable file,
    providing a history mechanism by means of &quot;=3D(1)&quot;<br>
    - type is replaced by whatis, which produces output that can be
    re-evaluated by the shell<br>
    - functions can be exported, in the same ways like variables<br>
    <br>
    keyword history: I always imagined that the Bourne shell would have
    been in much wider use even nowadays, if only it had provided line
    editing and a history at some point. Why not? Even Kenneth Almquist
    released his SVR4-like reimplementation intentionally without
    history. All that might have been implemented more elegant directly
    in the terminal I/O instead of in every program? (that is, not in a
    MS-DOS-like way, where every program even needs its own pager).<br>
    <br>
    I still wonder if it would be possible to properly provide line
    editing and history in the terminal I/O in general.<br>
