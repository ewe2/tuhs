Hi,

> I don't know if this is interesting to anyone, but I thought I'd share that 386BSD will install on Bochs (although slowly, and it's prone to crashing), however once the first patchkit is installed, it'll then run on Qemu! (0.11.0, it seems the new bios layout of 0.12 is incompatible)
Is it possible to install it in QEMU at all without using another emulator? (hardware machine is ok)

Would you be able to contact in QEMU developer's list with SeaBIOS maintainer to find what makes it stop working on 0.12.x branch?

Would you mind putting the information about how to make it running, how well it runs, so on, on QEMU's officlal OS support list (at http://www.claunia.com/qemu/ )?

Under what license is that operating system?

> qemu.exe -L pc-bios -hda bsd386.qcow2 -M isapc -net nic -net user -no-reboot -m 256

> At any rate, I figure this kind of brings 386BSD back out of it's grave.
