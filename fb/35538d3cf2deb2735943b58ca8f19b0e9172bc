Subject: [TUHS] A Wiki for Unix
Message-ID: <20151230013749.GA15802@minnie.tuhs.org>

I decided that, given that we have a few years until the 50th anniversary,
that I would set up a wiki for Unix in a similar vein to the Multicians one.

So I've made a start at http://wiki.tuhs.org (if/when the A record propagates).

I'd love to get some other people to help out, but I'll keep adding stuff
and we will see how it goes. Any good anecdotes about Unix are most welcome!

If you want to get edit status, register and then e-mail me so I can
manually mark you as having edit status.

Cheers, Warren
