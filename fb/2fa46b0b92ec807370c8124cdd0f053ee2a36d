As was pointed out, you dont get tcp/ip with v5/6/7.
4.2BSD does not run on the simh hardware, although you can
get quasijarus (4.3BSD) to run.

You can run vi in quasijarus.

You can't do this with v5/v6/v7 (at least with the pdp-11) since they
dont support the multi-serial card that simh emulates.  You only
get the console (which you can access over telnet if you configure
it so).

I don't remember if you can use the interdata32 port with multiple
ttys.

You can do this in quasijarus just fine, or even just run telnetd
on the emulated system itself.
