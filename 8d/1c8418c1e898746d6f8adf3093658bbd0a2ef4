> In addition, when Dennis would talk about Coherent and his evaluation of =
the source code, he said he used the known to him, but not widely known bug=
s in Unix to try to catch copying. If there was copying, those would be cop=
ied. If it was freshly implemented, there's a high likelihood that they wou=
ldn't. His conclusion was that someone had access to a lot of knowledge abo=
ut the Unix system given the fidelity of the implementation, but the lack o=
f bugs and novel ways of doing it suggested independent implementation.

Both Coherent and 4.4BSD have stuck out to me as examples of not-quite-so-c=
lean-room implementations that did well enough (more than enough for BSD) a=
nd didn't die a fiery death in litigation (as much as USL tried...).  What =
I find interesting is that in this day and age, it seems there is almost a =
requirement for true "clean-room" implementation if something is going to b=
e replicated, which I understand to mean the team developing the new implem=
entation can't be the same team that performed a detailed analysis of the p=
roduct being reimplemented, but the latter team can produce a white paper/w=
riteup/memorandum describing the results of their analysis and the developm=
ent team can then use that so long as it doesn't contain any implementation=
 details.

I've always wondered how cleanly that sort of thing can actually be proven =
and enforced, and I've always thought back to the Coherent situation as an =
almost model example.  Where proving copying outright can be difficult, kno=
wing one's own product well enough to know the bugs that are incredibly obs=
cure but also reliably consistent is a great way to peg a faithful recreati=
on vs. a flat out copy job.  That said, my assumption with complete UNIX re=
-implementations is that folks at least had access to the manuals, perhaps =
had used UNIX before in some capacity.  I would assume the current definiti=
on of a clean-room implementation only requires that the developers/impleme=
ntors don't have access to the code of the parent product (source or revers=
e engineered), but could read manuals, study behavior in-situ, and use that=
 level of "reverse engineering" to extract the design from the implementati=
on, so not knowing the gritty details, Coherent could be a true clean-room.

BSD is a different beast, as they were literally replacing the AT&T source =
code before their eyes, so there isn't much argument that can be made for 4=
.4BSD being a "clean-room" implementation of UNIX.  Simply for compatibilit=
y and upgrade-ability of existing systems, they had to be incredibly accura=
te to the original design.  Given that, that's one of the more surprising t=
hings to me about 4.4BSD prevailing in the lawsuit, because while Berkeley =
could easily prove that they had replaced most of AT&T's code, there's stil=
l the fact that their team did have complete and unfettered access to Bell =
UNIX code at least circa 32V.  Not sure if the licensing allowed for source=
-code cross-talk between USG/USL UNIX source and Berkeley, but I remember r=
eading somewhere that CSRG students and faculty avoided commercial UNIX lik=
e the plague, going so far as to not even look at the literature to see wha=
t changes occurred since 32V.

Anywho just some thoughts, I find the realm of reverse engineering and re-i=
mplementation fascinating, and am always interested in this sort of discuss=
ion.

- Matt G.

P.S. Don't want to derail the thread with this, unless it's deemed worthy a=
ddition, but feel free to email privately.  Does anyone know if there was a=
 "formal" PDP-11 and/or VAX disassembler produced by Bell?  I know there wa=
s one floating around the "user maintained" utilities at some point, I reca=
ll seeing a note in a manual saying something to the effect "Rumor has it t=
here is a PDP-11 disassembler" but I'm curious if such tools were ever prov=
ided in any sort of official capacity.  I've been doing some research on wh=
at RE tools people had on hand at the time, think "objdump" from GNU binuti=
ls.
