It is rather a part of the VFS interface that has first been completed with 
SunOS-3.0 in late 1985.

There are small changes introduced into the VFS switch for SVr4 to permit to 
mount special filesystems without the need of root permissions. They cause the 
major differences between SunOS-4 and Svr4.

VFS uses two interface parts: 

-	the VFS switch with the vfs interface functions to mount a filesystem
	and to stat it

-	the VFS vnode interface with the vnode interface functions to hold the
	interfaces like open(),	mmap(), ...
