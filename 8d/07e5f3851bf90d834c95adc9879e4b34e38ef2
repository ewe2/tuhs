I am now dangerously close to getting 2.11BSD on my 11/44. ^_^
I got a SCSI disk controller (Viking UDT) and TS11 tapes, and 16 ports of
DZ11s  (Anyone got jumper/DIP switch info on these?), but my problem is
lack of a boot tape.

Anyway, since I have other machines around which can grok SCSI disks, I tried
making an RP06 image on Supnik's emulator, installing the rauboot instead of
hkuboot, but it failed.  The PDP-11 read the bootstrap in OK and the bootstrap
was running but it was looping (I forgot the address).

Has anyone done this before?  I would use a SCSI tape to boot from but the
SCSI tape drive I have died.  (Roached literally - one of the little fsckers
got inside it and got fried.)

Are you sure it was a RP06 image?  hkuboot is the RK06/07 bootstrap.

How did you move the RP06 (or RK06) image to the physical SCSI drive?  You
were asking about doing it with RT-11 a few weeks ago, but you *do*
know that RT-11 won't conventionally access the 65536th (and
2*65536th, and 3*65536th...) blocks on a MSCP partition, don't you?  (There
is a way of accessing that last block, but you have to code it with
a .SPFUN call to the DU driver, and none of the distributed RT-11 utilities
work on that last block, even with the /DEVICE qualifier.)

Did the version of 2.11BSD you're working from have disklabel support in
the hk driver?  Disklabel support there was added recently (where "recent"
= 2 years ago).

Get us the address (HALT the 11/44, either with the front panel toggle
or control-P from the console) and we'll find out why it's looping.

I have the DZ11 (M7814)  user's guide right here. 

1) Priority insert level 5 goes in E41.

2) E72 -- Address.
   Closed (on) is binary 1.

	A12 A11 A10  A9  A8  A7  A6  A5  A4  A3
       -----------------------------------------
       | 10| 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
   on  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
  off  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
       -----------------------------------------

  Addressing examples:
	160000 -- A12 thru A3 OFF
	160010 -- A12 thru A4 OFF, A3 ON
	177770 -- A12 thru A3 ON
	(OFF=Logical 0, ON=Logical 1)

3) E81 -- Vector
   Closed (on) is a binary 0.

       -unused- V3  V4  V5  V6  V7  V8
       ---------------------------------    
       | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
   on  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
  off  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
       ---------------------------------

  Vectoring examples:
	Vector	V8   V7   V6   V5   V4   V3
	 300    ON   OFF  OFF  ON   ON   ON
	 310    ON   OFF  OFF  ON   ON   OFF
	 770    OFF  OFF  OFF  OFF  OFF  OFF
	(ON=Logical 0, OFF=Logical 1)

  Let me know if you need any more info.

Did you successfully build from a boot-tape image on the emulator, or did you copy
the RP06 image (such as on the PUPS archive) directly to the disk and tranfer
the physical drive to the PDP?  (And what method/command did you use?)

I do this regularly for my vaxen.   10 to 1 Steven Schultz has been this route
on the PDP-11's tho (Hi Steven :).

Lemme know if I can help more.

Hmm.. I've got a manual for the Viking UDT, and I'll try to remember to 
bring it in on Monday. 

I don't know anything about how 2.11BSD boots. However, I had an
interesting
time trying to get 4.3BSD on my 750 to boot off this controller. It
turned out 
that the Viking's emulation of the UDA50 isn't *quite* accurate, and
that the 4.3 boot
code was using one of the edge-of-the-envelope features that the Viking
didn't quite 
emulate right. I modified the bootstrap slightly and got it going.
Whether this 
has anything to do with your problem, I don't know. (It was worth all
the effort 
in the end, to see the monster hulking 750 booting of a little dinky
plastic zip drive!)

[Replied to Tim but not the list - oops!]

Method to transfer drive:  FTPd disk image to MicroVAX running NetBSD,
used cat.  Saved the RT11 image beforehand.  When BSD died I put RT11 back.
RT11 works.

Disk image was an RP06 constructed from a boot tape I made.  It used stuff
from the PUPS archive but wasn't the image from the archive.

I will get the loop address shortly - I have to get an extension cord back to
power the machine.
