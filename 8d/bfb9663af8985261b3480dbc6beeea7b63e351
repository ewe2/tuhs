That's a matter of opinion.  Many people consider it good manners to
specifically mention people participating in a discussion.  For
example,
https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/freebsd-questions/arti=
cle.html#idp53204040
specifically states:

  Unless there is a good reason to do otherwise, reply to the sender
  and to FreeBSD-questions [the list].

That's what procmail is for.

Yes, that's in that URL too:

  Put your response in the correct place (after the text to which it
  replies). It is very difficult to read a thread of responses where
  each reply comes before the text to which it replies.

Also another thing that I still think very important:

  If the submitter did not abide by format conventions (lines too
  long, inappropriate subject line), please fix it. In the case of an
  incorrect subject line (such as =E2=80=9CHELP!!??=E2=80=9D), change the s=
ubject line
  to (say) =E2=80=9CRe: Difficulties with sync PPP (was: HELP!!??)=E2=80=9D=
=2E That way
  other people trying to follow the thread will have less difficulty
  following it.

That doesn't explicitly address the issue of change of topic within a
thread, but it should.
