Subject: [TUHS] In V6 exit(): wakeup(&proc[1])) unnecessary?
Message-ID: <200212221317.gBMDHnw00205@bsd.korb>

Hi,
encouraged by the profound answers I thankfully recieved to my previous
question about the Unix V6 kernel, here is another one:

When a process terminates (in sys1.c/exit()), it explicitly wakes up
the init process. In light of the fact, that every process has a parent,
this extra wakeup(&proc[1]) seems unnecessary. Furthermore, the "goto loop:"
at the end of exit() will never be executed.

So is this just defensive programming, or did I miss something?

Greetings,

Wolfgang Helbig
