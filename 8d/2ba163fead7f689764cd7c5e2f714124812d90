I'm not thrilled with the systemd stuff either, I still don't see that it is
solving anything that wasn't solved.  But somebody must like it, it's a big
change.

vim, on the other hand, oh do I love me some vim.  It's pretty faithful to
the original vi but you get split windows, infinite undo, it remembers 
stuff from one invocation to the next, it's pretty sweet.
