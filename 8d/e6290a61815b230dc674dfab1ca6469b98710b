I have no explanation for your problem, but it has nothing to do with speed.
Q-bus is Q-bus, and it follows Q-bus timing, which is completely independent of
the VAX CPU timing.

Is the new CPU board firmly seated? Nothing broken or disturbed in the
backplane when swapping the boards?

Ultrix' MSCP code is vastly superior to anything we've ever had in BSD. I plan
to lift the MSCP/SCA framework from Ultrix wholesale in Quasijarus down the
line.
