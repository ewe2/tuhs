yepp, it gets better with later archive files. In the first run I have
changed: 

1995-October.txt, 1995-November.txt, 1995-December.txt,
1996-March.txt, 1996-September.txt, 1996-November.txt,
1997-August.txt, 1997-September.txt, 1997-October.txt,
1997-November.txt, 1998-April.txt, 1998-February.txt,
1998-March.txt, 1998-May.txt, 1998-August.txt,
1998-November.txt, 1998-December.txt, 1999-January.txt,
1999-February.txt, 1999-March.txt, 1999-May.txt,

1999-November.txt, 1999-October.txt, 1999-December.txt,

I started with an empty line followed by '^(Date|From|To|Message-Id|Received):'.
There is at least one match of a 'Date:' in the message's body and there
are cases where people appended emails incl. headers to their emails. So
a little bit more tweaking is needed.

One other thing I haven't made my mind up about is date headers. Some
emails don't have a date header. I feel a bit uneasy about manipulating
the emails and add a date header. On the other hand an approximate date 
header would allow to sort the emails in the clients and give them a bit
more context. Any opinions on that?
