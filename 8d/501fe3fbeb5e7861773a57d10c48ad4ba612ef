There is FUZIX by Alan Cox: 

  https://www.fuzix.org
  https://github.com/EtchedPixels/FUZIX

which is a blend of V7+BSD userland plus a mix of different UZI
implementations from the '80s and a lot of new code. It runs on a
variety of "small" CPUs, including pdp-11, Z80/Z180/Z280, 8080, 8085,
8086, 6502, 6803, 6809, 68k, and a few dozens platforms. 

There is some initial support for Apple IIe there. 

I have used it myself on several retrobrew Z80/Z180 systems, but not on
an Apple IIe, so I can't tell it will work for sure. It's worth trying
it out though.
