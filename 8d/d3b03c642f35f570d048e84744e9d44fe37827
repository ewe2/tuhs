It's certainly not perfect; if you'd like to suggest improvements,
again, they would be gratefully accepted, the first link I sent you
was documentation for the generic file system code, and while there is
certainly more that I'd love to see documented (improvements and bug
reports gratefully accepted), the entry points are certainly one of
the things that is quite well defined:
