Subject: [TUHS] observations on Unix v6's mount command
Message-ID: <CADxT5N60TwE7y2niitqyJVxo9N3swT=UmSp=23yDe_aoNPzs6A@mail.gmail.com>

I was trying to look at mini-unix so I mounted the disk image inside
unix v6 via:

/etc/mount /dev/rk4 /usr/mini-unix

and I noticed that if I ran the mount command as a user and not root
that /etc/mtab would not be updated (but it was updated as expected as
root). Of course /etc/mtab is owned by root :)

Then I noticed something else when I did an ls in the /usr directory:

drwxrwxrwx 20       31      368 Sep  3  1976 mini-unix

Normally I would see things like:

drwxrwxr-x  2 bin            48 May 13  1975 adm

What does the 31 mean?
