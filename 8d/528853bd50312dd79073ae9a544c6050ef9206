Sorry I' ve been a lurker so long after subscribing. I had a problem in my
e-mail configuration and, coupled with some congress travels, missed most
list messages until I noticed today.

Regarding the disassembler, has anyone tried the one derMouse included in
his emulator in TUHS?

I have also found another PDP11 disassembler (for RT11) at

	http://ftp.dbit.com/pub/pdp11/rt11/

For the bold, there seems to be another PDP11 disassembler in BBC basic
at 
	http://mdfs.net/Software/PDP11/ 
this one comes with an assembler AND SOME UnixIO.mac library which leads 
me to suppose it may work on a.out files. It may probably be used under
a CP/M emulator with BBC Basic.

Finally, what about IDA, the interactive disassembler? It once claimed
to support PDP11 and old versions may be around (the 4.9 is free but 
I ain't sure it still supports PDP11).

Any of those should help build a current one for the a.out format.

BTW, and just for fun, I just found out about pdpxasm, which says is a
"PDP-11 cross-assembler, cross-linker, and cross-disassembler run under
DOS, by Strobe Data Inc." and is also freely downloadable.

Might be fun to see what its cross-disassembler produces.
