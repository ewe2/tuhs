Well, I may have exaggerated the time a CR takes slightly, in fact 
thinking of 5 or 6 perhaps I was remembering my other teleprinter: a 50 
baud Creed 7B which I no longer have.  I'm still sure it's normally more 
than two character times.  Yes, I know about keeping fingers away - and 
how to adjust various parts of an ASR33, and I have the tech manuals. 
I'm sitting next to a working ASR33 right now.
