Subject: [pups] A 2nd http mirror of the Unix Archive
Message-ID: <200109270532.f8R5WbZ62518@minnie.tuhs.org>

All,
	Oleg Safiullin has set up a Unix Archive mirror outside of
Australia. You can find it at:

	http://unix-archive.pdp11.org.ru

He is using the same username & password list as www.tuhs.org is.

Thanks to Oleg for setting this up.
	Warren

P.S I do have a number of other people interested in setting up other
mirrors. When I get back from this week's conference, I'll contact you
all.
