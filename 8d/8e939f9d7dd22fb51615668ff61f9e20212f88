Well, that's true enough.  It's also true that modern standard German is
a "Middle German dialect", in the technical sense of the English word
"dialect", which is not the same as the technical sense of the German
words "Dialekt" and "Mundart".  That is, both have been handed down
from parents to children directly from Middle German, spoken in many
varieties throughout the German-speaking lands in the 11th to 15th C.
