I'd love to document Greg Chesson's contributions in the Unix history
repository [1].  I'm ashamed to say that I seem to have missed them.
Are there particular pieces of code we know he authored?  Just send me a
brief note, or, even better, a GitHub pull request for the author-path
map files [2].  I will summarize to the list.

Many thanks,

Diomidis
