This is sort of my late in life mission.  Here's a description of a session
that I've proposed for an upcoming conference.

	Once upon a time there was Budweiser. Then, along came craft beer
	which started a movement. Now, one can find a whole range of
	offerings from craft cheese to artisanal baking soda. Hard to find
	is craft programming. What’s called "programming technology" today
	seems to be the art of minimizing the damage that can be done by
	monkeys at keyboards. Since we can no longer purchase even a
	toothpick that doesn’t contain a processor and a blue LED, we depend
	on code. How can we revive the art of programming? How do we foster
	the creation of good code instead of spending energy minimizing the
	damage that can be done by bad code? Our lives depend on it.

My two cents is that craft programmers know how to write good documentation.
Probably one of the things that made BTL so wonderful was the breadth of
knowledge that people had.  Ken was recently telling me about Lee McMahon who
was a classically trained monk in addition to writing qsort for V3.
