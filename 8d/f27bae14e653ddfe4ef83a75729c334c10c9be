I don't know if it will help you or not, but I always dealt with this 
problem (allbeit on more modern unixes) via the following:

stty erase <Control>+<v><Backspace>

It seems as if the Control v tells the shell to insert the following key 
literally.  You may not need to do that if the shell is not interpreting ^h.
