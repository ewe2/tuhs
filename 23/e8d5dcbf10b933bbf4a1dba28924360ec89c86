I THINK that I don't like ls colours, but I have to admit that since I
started trying to pay attention more, I find colour coding has some
value, for some meaning of some and no value defined.

Actually no, I still hate colour LS. I like ls -F because the implied
extra information can be semantically extracted with a grep, although
why find . -type d -maxdepth 1 isn't being used is beyond me.

de gustibus non disputandum, but on a unibus, there are also no
disputes because the bus master arbitrates
