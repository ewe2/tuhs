I sent a similar message some time ago, but I haven't
seen it appear in the mailing list, so here goes again.
Apologies if it ends up as a duplicate.

A computed goto is an optimized switch, and that optimization
goes back to the original C compiler. Mostly driven by
considerations of size and speed of the Unix kernel, Dennis
quite early on taught the compiler to choose among three
compilation strategies for a switch: a chain of comparisons, 
a tree of comparisons, or a computed goto, depending on the
number and density of alternatives.

The compilation of the system-call dispatch table was
a perfect example of "good for interpreters."

I have always assumed that other mainline compilers behave
similarly, but I have no solid knowledge about that.
