I just last week installed v6 from tape image. I have to admit, I like
working boot images more :-) (Since I only have an emulator and not
the real thing, I don't have the need to physically transfer the
stuff.)

Hmm, I just did this now, but I have to admit, I only browsed the
instructions of most of them. I followed the instructions of 412/413
because I feared I'd forget to update init before rebooting the new
kernel.
But otherwise I applied all patches to 442, and then rebuilt the
kernel, rebooted, and did "make build; make installsrc". Seemed to
work.

I noticed 2 patches, which patched /usr/src/sys/GENERIC/Makefile, but
this is a generated file I think. At least it wasn't present, because
I removed /usr/src/sys/GENERIC.

chris
