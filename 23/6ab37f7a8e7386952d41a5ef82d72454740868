Pure text interface will always be the most elegant way to converse with a
machine.  And Unix is the most elegant command line based system.

The world lost something when it moved to GUI.  I still prefer to use the
old phosphor based CRT monitors even with modern computers and because the
text mode is still inherent in modern graphics cards (as a legacy mode), it
is possible to not use GUI at all even today.

That was one of the main reasons I disliked Plan9.  It embraced the
"windows interface" trend of the mid 80s.
