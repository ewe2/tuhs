I thought this comment was very good.

I went looking for =E2=80=9CClem=E2=80=99s Law=E2=80=9D (presume Clem =

Any hints anyone can suggest or history on the comment?

	Plan 9 is very cool but I am channeling my inner Clem,=20
	Plan 9 didn't meet Clem's law.
	It was never compelling enough to make the masses love it.
	Linux was good enough.
