In the days when memory and clock cycles were costly, an extra decrement 
or subtract was not something to be taken lightly :)

On the other hand, I can see that you could solve this in the 
preprocessor. In my example, just make it:

MOV AL, [SI + (ARRAY1 - FIRSTELEMENT)]

And let the assembler deal with it.

Still, there's something oddly "artificial" about that, again from the 
machine language point of view. There's nothing "idiotic" about it IMHO. 
It's just the way processors actually work.

Of course, if you're really into abstraction, well, to each his own :)
