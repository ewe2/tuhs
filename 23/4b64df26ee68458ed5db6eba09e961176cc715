Subject: [TUHS] unirubik port to unix v5 is complete
Message-ID: <CADxT5N6D9ZBj+5ZHYTtW6HffBXYZx9-V+5-duDeWpZ4_qe+yPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I finally managed to get unirubik working on unix v5.

I thought you folks might be interested in looking at the changes I
had to make. It was a bit harder than the port to v6 but porting to v6
first did make things a bit easier.

I've included links to all three versions. unirubik.c.v5 needs gets.c

http://www.maxhost.org/other/unirubik.c.v7
http://www.maxhost.org/other/unirubik.c.v6
http://www.maxhost.org/other/unirubik.c.v5
http://www.maxhost.org/other/gets.c

The unirubik for v5 was considerably smaller than the other versions,
a mere 5492 bytes.

Mark
