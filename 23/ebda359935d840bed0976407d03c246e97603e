I got it sorted.. the program was mistakenly thinking there
were constant window resizes.  the flicker is now solved.
There is still some issue where the keyboard processing
is sometimes getting stuck during startup...  when it
works, it seems to work well, but it usually fails on startup..
more debugging.
