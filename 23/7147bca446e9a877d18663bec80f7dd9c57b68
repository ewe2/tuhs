I find those flags really useful when doing forensic analysis on a file 
system :-)  One particular instance was at $ORKPLACE some years back when 
a critical chunk of a file system had somehow disappeared overnight (it 
was our source base!).  I got to work by comparing login sessions with 
those someone-unknown "ls" flags and had just about nailed the perp who 
was online at the time when I was ordered off it in no uncertain terms.

Ummm, did I mention that my then $BOSS had a habit of working from home 
after a few (and quite a few) drinks?  As I said, I was this -><- far away 
from fingering him...  As it stood I knew who it was but wasn't able to 
prove it in time.
