I think that's right.  The missing bit is that while once the only =
people who had to worry about processors with a lot of parallelism were =
the HPC people, who fortunately often had algorithms which parallelised =
rather well.  Now you have to worry about it if you want to write =
programs for the processor in your laptop and probably the processor in =
your watch.  Or you would, if the designers of those processors had not =
gone to heroic lengths to make them look like giant PDP-11s.  =
Unfortunately those heroic lengths haven't been heroic enough as has =
become apparent, and will presumably fall apart increasingly rapidly =
from now on.

So he's right: the giant PDP-11 thing is a disaster, but he's wrong =
about its cause: it's not caused by C, but by the fact that writing =
programs for what systems really need to look like is just an unsolved =
problem.  It might have helped if we had not spent forty years sweeping =
it busily under the carpet.

A thing that is also coming of course, which he does not talk about, is =
that big parallel machines are also going to start getting increasingly =
constrained by physics which means that a lot of the tricks that HPC =
people use will start to fall apart as well.
