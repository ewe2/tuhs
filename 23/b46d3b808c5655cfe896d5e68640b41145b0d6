Subject: [pups] 2.11BSD networking on simulator
Message-ID: <3A78919C.3D604E23@bigfoot.com>

I'm running 2.11BSD on the Supnik simulator, and wondering how to get it
networked.  
This sim seems to only support serial lines, so maybe I have to move
over to the 
Begemot simulator - in which case, is it best to use FreeBSD or Linux as
the host
for the sim?  I'm more familiar with Linux but I have FreeBSD running
now - the question
is what's easier to set up for networking.

Does anyone have a working Begemot sim setup with networking, used with
2.11BSD?  If so,
could you post your config files?  The Begemot sim seems a lot more
complex to set up
than Supnik.

Cheers,

Richard

I've tried the suggestions for getting files in and out of the Supnik
sim,
in particular using rl0 mapped to x.tar, and 'tar cvf /dev/rrl0a
/etc/hosts'.
However, tar complains: 'tar: tape write error: Read-only file system'.

The disklabel for rl0 looks like:

# /dev/rrl0a:

disk:

Presumably I need to create a valid disklabel, but it would be good to
have some advice on what a valid one
would look like.

I've also tried the same sort of thing with 'tar cvbBf 20 /dev/rmt0
/etc/hosts', and 
something like a tar file is produced - however, GNU tar on Linux and
FreeBSD 4.2 tar can't
read this, saying 'this doesn't look like a tar file'.  Is there some
trick to getting this
to work, and am I better off using rl0 or rmt0?

The Begemot emulator was written on BSD, so you'll probably find it
easier to use under FreeBSD.

*sigh* I used to, and it worked well.  A number of changes in FreeBSD
have rendered the emulator non-functional, and I haven't had time to
find out what's wrong.  I'll take a look and see if I can see anything
obvious, but it might take me a while.

	It can not be done except perhaps with a SL/IP link.  The Supnik 
	simulator does not have an emulated ethernet device.

> the host

	I use BSD/OS myself, but FreeBSD works very nicely also.  I've not
	tried it with linux.

> Does anyone have a working Begemot sim setup with networking, used with

	Quite a few folks have it running.

	Yes, it is quite a bit more complex (cryptic) to set up.

	Here's what I use to run P11 with.  If you strip out all of the
	macro preprocessing stuff the config file is much more readable and
	not nearly as cryptic as before.

When I looked last night at the machine assist (mch.s) for Ultrix-11/3.1
source, all I could easily find was consistent with this, contained in
the V6 start document:

    The main difference between an 11/40 and an 11/45 (or 11/70)
    system is that in the former instruction restart after a
    segmentation violation caused by overflowing a user stack
    must be handled by software, while in the latter machines
    there is hardware help.

which in more detail means, if I understand right, there is no SSR2
register in the MMU so the kernel code needs to disassemble the
instruction to backup over it for restarting as per above.

The Ultrix mch.s file has code that does this (quite a lot) and I
noticed a few cases that checked it the cputype is 34.

Cheers,

I have the begemot simulator running very effectively on Linux, although I have
not used the emulated ethernet connection.  If anyone knows how to set this up
on linux then I would welcome some help.

I must say that although p11 takes quite a bit of setting up it is well worth
the trouble.

Regards

Robin

Well, as some response to this challenge "get an image to run in an emulator",
I visited Bob Supnik's Computer History Simulation Project web page

	<www.tiac.net/users/mps/retro/>

and followed the links to the sources for SIMH v2.5a and to the Unix V6
disk images.

I read the documentation file "simh_doc.txt", and compiled the
simulator.  Then I read "simh_swre.txt", unpacked the V6 images, ran
the simulator and attached the three RK05 images to it, and booted
RK0.  All according to the instructions.

I got the bootstrap prompt "@" to which I typed "unix" and it came up
with a "login:" prompt, to which I could log in as root, and do things.

It's not quite the same V6 image that I remember from the olden days of
loading onto an 11/40 from magtape.  The login prompt seems not to be
";login:" as we still see on the Usenix magazine.  dmr's account seems
to have vanished but ken's is still there.  And that's how I spent a
few hours last night.

In case it matters, the underlying hardware/software platform is an AMD
K6-3 running Mandrake 7.1 Linux.
