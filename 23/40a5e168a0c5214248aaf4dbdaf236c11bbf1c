​Larry is being polite.   It sucked.​

​ It was never designed for it.  dmr designed Streams to replace the tty

networking into it.​

​Right.   This is one of the places where SVR4 != Solaris

I was researching a book a long time ago and looked at this.  I had
Solaris, SVR4 and some other stuff at the time.  Like you bit rot has long
set in on the details, but I do remember that the primary thing that
Solaris had was support for Sun's threading model and the networking code
had to be a first class citizen ​or it was not going to scale.
