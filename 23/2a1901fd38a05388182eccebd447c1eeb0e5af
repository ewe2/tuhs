Side note on my own post:

I use Thunderbird to read all my personal/professional email except 
where I'm forced to use Outlook

I've built an extensive list of whitelisted email sources and 
destinations (TUHS for example). Anything that doesn't match that 
automatically goes into my SPAM folder.

So even if I turned off all SPAM filtering upstream, I still wouldn't 
get anything in my Inbox that I didn't want to see. My SPAM folder would 
be huge though ;)
