Subject: [TUHS] Reorganising the Unix Archive?
Message-ID: <20170218001244.GB17910@minnie.tuhs.org>

Hi all, I think the current layout of the Unix Archive at
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/ is starting to show its limitations as we get
more systems and artifacts that are not specifically PDP-11 and Vax.

I'm after some suggestions on how to reorganise the archive. Obviously
there are many ways to do this. Just off the top of my head, top level:

 - Applications: things which run at user level
 - Systems: things which have a kernel
 - Documentation
 - Tools: tools which can be used to deal with systems and files

Under Applications, several directories which hold specific things. If
useful, perhaps directories that collect similar things.

Under Systems, a set of directories for specific organisations (e.g. Research,
USL, BSD, Sun, DEC etc.). In each of these, directories for each system.

Under Documentation, several directories which hold specific things. If
useful, perhaps directories that collect similar things.

Under Tools, subdirectories for Disk, Tape, Emulators etc., then subdirs
for the specific tools.

Does this sound OK? Any refinements or alternate suggestions?

Cheers, Warren
