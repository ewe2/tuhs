Here is the PUPS list charter. If you have violent opposition to it, then
please e-mail me.

	Warren

The PUPS list on minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au promotes communication between those
people who are interested in the versions of Unix which ran on PDP-11s. Unix
is defined as the set of operating systems who can trace their source code
ancestry back to the 1st to 7th Editions of research UNIX from Bell Labs.

Topics that fall within the list's charter include:

	+ how to install, configure & maintain a PDP-11 Unix system
	+ discussion of PDP-11 hardware issues related to PDP-11 Unix
	+ applications for PDP-11 Unix systems
	+ modification of PDP-11 Unix systems
	+ technical comparisons between PDP-11 Unix systems
	+ anecdotes relating to the history & development of PDP-11 Unix
	+ discussion & announcements of the contents of the PDP-11
	  section of the Unix Archive

Topics that fall outside of the list's charter include:

	+ discussion on non PDP-11 Unix systems, unless they are being
	  compared technically with PDP-11 Unix systems
	+ attacks on particular individuals, groups or organisations
	+ postings which disenfranchise or alienate a individual list
	  subscriber, a group of subscribers, or a particular version
	  of PDP-11 Unix

The list will, in general, not be moderated. However, if a list subscriber
continues to send off-charter postings to the list after warnings to that
effect, then their postings may be moderated.

Hi Friends,

I really appreciate that. I'm - generally - more a reader than a user
of ancient code, so concentration on a certain version (or
architecture, i.e.  BSD vs the VAX or others) is not as important for
me as is an uninterupted, complete coverage of historical versions.

Having access to this version of BSD4.4 and (soon) all the other
stuff, Tim Shoppa discovered recently, is really GREAT for me.

Please keep everything You can. I think I can predict reliably, future
generations of software historians will be very thankful.

Regards -- Markus

I agree. Still I'd prefer (and humbly ask) from Michael Solokov a more
diplomatic attitude. As far as I can see, Mr Bostic has contributed to
UNIX in general and to the PUPS later, which entitles him to being
treated somewhat more respectfully :-)

UNIX is variance, not a one-size-fits-all system.

On the other side, Michael has ventured, to port BSD4.3 to modern
VAXens (a noble enterprise in my eyes), and it would make me sad, to
see so excellent and noble :-) men fight each other. Let's avoid that,
and let there be no war in the (ancient) UNIX camp.

I hope Michael had no intention to hurt the feelings of Keith Bostic.

Hi Tim,

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. Seriously: If You ever do not want to put
something in the archive, give it to me. I have the impression one
needs the intermediate versions to be ever able to crosscheck the
transfer of features between the diverse branches.

Well, perhaps not the archive structure should be changed. What I miss
is more something like a getting-started-guide: Which versions you
could try first with - let's say the emulator - and how to boot them.

Well, the demarcation lines are not wuite clearly drawn. Only
yesterday my eyes fell on a paragraph in Peter Salus Book: 4.xBSD
brought ... improvments ... also a port to the Intel 386/486
Architecture by Bill Jolitz. Well, 386BSD became FreeBSD and it's
offspring.

Why can't we just stay on big family ? Of course FreeBSD has it's
archives elsewhere, but still no reason to divide instead of unite ?

Well, not to be disprespectful to honorable members of the community
certainly should be a parameter :-)

It makes me sad to see all this.

And some use emulators within modern systems to get a feel for 'the

Weell, I don't know about that.  All them modern Vaxens aren't really

For those trying to keep track of the exact Unix history graph,
it should be noted that the above history isn't quite right.

Jolitz' original 386 port was partially done for CSRG and partially
done for what became BSDI.  A somewhat infamous falling-out during
Usenix resulted in Jolitz *redoing* his 386 port and releasing it
as 386BSD shortly after BSDI released BSD/386.

BSD/386 0.0 was released, then 0.1.  Jolitz kept saying things
about "0.2" but it began to become clear to most people that it
wouldn't be released soon, if ever.  A semi-official "patchkit"
sprung up, and soon most people were running 386BSD 0.1 plus
patchkit X.

Meanwhile, Adam Glass and Chris Demetriou and, soon, a small
number of others, started work on what became NetBSD, a centrally
managed free software project that sought to bring some CSRG-like
focus to the 386BSD chaos.  An early snapshot of this made its
way to the patchkit folks, who declined for various reasons to
participate.  NetBSD 0.8 was released, and a little bit later
the patchkit maintainers (mostly) released FreeBSD.  Though there
was new work -- and would eventually be a *lot* of new work --
there was also clearly a lot of code that came not from 386BSD
or the patchkits but from that pre-0.8 NetBSD snapshot.  Since
these facts are pretty well known among the principals involved
it's always been a mystery to me why Unix history graphs seem
to get the later wiggles in the xBSD line all wrong.

My $0.02:


I once wondered whether the techniques of literary textual
criticism could be used in order to determine whether a Linux,
FreeBSD, groff -- whatever! -- is in any way derived from an
earlier work. Textual criticism considers a work by examining
several or all of the extant textual variations in an attempt
to determine what the author originally wrote; it has been
used to reconstruct the "original" texts of the ancient as
well as some modern writers, such as James Joyce. It
yields a tree of texts, in which the root is the "original,"
and the sibling children of any node are the descendants of a
common, perhaps hypothetical, text. I don't know much
else about it, except that its results may depend on alot
of knowledge and informed speculation. The textual critics
work bottom-up to arrive at an original text; I am thinking
of a top-down process, working from an original text, to show that a
work lower in a tree is derived from the original. If such a
technique were valid at all, its validity would only be improved
with the availablity of many, many "texts." The techniques might be
more useful where, for example, there were several V7 tapes that people
thought were original, but which, on inspection, turned out to be different.
In this situation, textual criticism might be used to reconstruct a "true," V7
release tape, and, in this situation, would be a bottom-up application of the techniques.

In any event, I think that it is important to preserve alot of
tapes, and to keep them separate with as much information as
possible about their pedigree. If someone ever did use such
a technique -- or any other technique -- to reconstruct a "true" release,
it is important that they document their work and not throw away the
tapes that contributed to the "true" tape, because even more
tapes may appear in the future which could lead to
the reconstruction of an even truer tape.

No, no emulator can give you a feel for the genuine article. You won't get that
feel until you get your toes crushed by an H9642 side panel, get your knuckles
scraped by a BA23, or take a day off with your back hurting after carrying an
RA81 across the campus.

Hello!

I recently obtained a beast which appears to be a PDP 11/53+, and I want
to run some Unix on it (Wahey!). I've got a small problem though: It
only has one(!) RD32A disk (42MB). I know that this probably won't be 
enough to hold a complete distribution, but which release can I install
bare-bones on that disk?

I might be able to slip in another MFM disk (but I don't have something
bigger than 21 MB at hand), provided I can low-level format it.

Your help is greatly appreciated..

According to Warren's Charter, PUPS and TUHS are both specifically for UNIX.
His Charter defines UNIX as follows:

"Unix is defined as the set of operating systems who can trace their source
code ancestry back to the 1st to 7th Editions of research UNIX from Bell Labs."

Any system that fits this definition automatically falls under the original
UNIX copyright and may not be distributed outside the circle of UNIX source
licensees. Therefore, if you think that FreeBSD fits this definition and
belongs in this group, you must stop publicly distributing it. Otherwise, it
does not belong in the archive or on these lists.

You can put the root partition of 2.11BSD on there quite nicely, it'll
live in 8 Mbytes.  Trimming down /usr to 42 Mbytes will depend on what
exactly you need from it, though.  Certainly you can set up a system
with compilers, etc., even though you won't be able to have all the
sources online at the same time.

You want to read Terry Kennedy's document on adding third-party disks
to DEC RQDX3 controllers.  You can find it at

  ftp://ftp.spc.edu/third-party-disks.txt

Information about formatting, jumper settings, etc., is all there.

Tim.

+ my $0.02 makes $1.00

From my perspective I have watched this argument on this
list about purism and otherwise.

From a practical sense, historical trueness makes sense
when we are considering changes to something.  That is 
to evaluate whether it was better before or after; with
the ultimate goal of coming up with a truly usefull sytem.
Otherwise O/S researchers would never be able to make
advancements because they would be repeating each others
mistakes.   But to take a lesson from history makes having
such an archive of old source important.

To get hung up on a particular release makes sense I guess
if you are a collector, such as one who collects vases
because that is an art form.  A vase from the Ming chinesse
period is worth more if it has not been modified (for instance
some later owner decides that there are not enough flowers
on the vase--so he adds some).   However with Systems software
this is not the case because it is not a tangible item such
as a processor such as a PDP-11 or PDP-8.  I know many people
that still run PDP-8's (I have one myself), but universally
ever user of the '8 is trying to make the software on it
run better and more efficiently.  

So I would not be one to castigate some pioneers of systems
software whoses names happened not to be K&R.  I am sure that
the both Kernigan and Richie both are marveled at what Unix
has become.  In fact I believe one of them went on to write
Plan-9 which is really off-the-wall compared to their earlier
work. 

Good software is inherrently in a steady process of evolution.
The only piece of software I have ever seen that never evolved
was the classic "Hello World" program that everybody learns to
write on their first lesson in programming.  

OK, That's it...

Now, stop right there! I'm an international agent and I'm armed! :-)

To start with, I don't want to use the term "modern", ever. As for what VAXen I
support and target, my primary emphasis is on BI/XMI VAXen, which are very big
and are absolute miracles of architectural beauty. They don't undermine the
original VAXness a single bit. On the opposite, they actually implement many of
the astounding miracles of the holy original VAX Architecture Reference Manual
that the original VAX-11s were only going to. I also place a high emphasis on
Q22-bus MicroVAXen, as they are readily available and don't require special
power, and yet they fully comply with the proper VAX architecture.

There are also BabyVAXen, which is what NutBSDists and others talking about
"modern VAXen" are probably talking about. Those are indeed very cost-reduced,
VAXness-deprived, and PeeCee-fied. I do plan on supporting them, just so that I
support every VAX ever made, but I by no means endorse them. They are not real
VAXen.

I'm asking you, once more, to take your fanaticism elsewhere.  I'm also
asking the moderator, once more, in light of this, your recent attacks
on Keith Bostic, your totally gratuitous "NutBSD" swipe in your most
recent missive, and your general misbehaviour and abysmal nettiquite in
your time on this list, to cause you to take your fanaticism elsewhere.

Had it ever occurred to you that others might not delineate "Unix"
in quite the same way in which you do?  Of course not.  Your opinion
is the only one that matters, and if anyone else doesn't see it that
way, well, then, by God, you'll just have to spew flamage until he
goes away.  Great.  Really, absolutely what's needed in a preservation
project.

Thor

In this case my definition of UNIX agrees with that set by the Charters for
both lists.
