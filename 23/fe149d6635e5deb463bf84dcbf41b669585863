I'm not thrilled with it either, but it seems to be how things are
going, so, I've been forced to learn how to use it.

I resisted it for a long time, installed nvi on my penguin boxes so I
could have something resembling the vi I was raised on, but I've come to
appreciate a few of its features.  It just took some time to reprogram

but it's not really 'the unix way'. :)
