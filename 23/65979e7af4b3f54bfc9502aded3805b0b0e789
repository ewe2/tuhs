How about this?

  In 1971 I began to extend the B language by adding a character type
  and also rewrote its compiler to generate PDP-11 machine instructions
  instead of threaded code.  Thus the transition from B to C was
  contemporaneous with the creation of a compiler capable of producing
  programs fast and small enough to compete with assembly language.  I
  called the slightly-extended language NB, for `new B.'

  [...]

  After creating the type system, the associated syntax, and the
  compiler for the new language, I felt that it deserved a new name;
  NB seemed insufficiently distinctive.  I decided to follow the
  single-letter style and called it C, leaving open the questing
  whether the name represented a progression through the alphabet or
  through the letters in BCPL.

Maybe this?

  After the TMG version of B was working, Thompson rewrote B in itself
  (a bootstrapping step).  During development, he continually struggled
  against memory limitations: each language addition inflated the
  compiler so it could barely fit, but each rewrite taking advantage
  of the feature reduced it size.
