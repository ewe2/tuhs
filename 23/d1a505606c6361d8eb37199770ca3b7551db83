A couple of Cambridge quota-related anecdotes:

In its early days the Debian bug tracker was run out of Ian Jackson's
personal account on our central Unix service. He had to delete bugs when
they were closed to keep within his disk quota.

Our mail software Exim has a two-level quota system: it handles quota
errors from the OS as a hard limit, with some annoying portability hacks
https://github.com/Exim/exim/blob/master/src/src/transports/appendfile.c#L1208
Exim it also has its own per-mailbox quota implementation. This can help
control memory usage (mainly by Pine, back in the day...) as well as
providing soft limit warnings and other bells and whistles.
