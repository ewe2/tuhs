Brantley can tell you that Plan 9 isn't dead, although the Labs aren't
really providiing the "central control" that Steve mentioned and which
is so valuable. 

There is even some innovation in the Plan 9 world, but much of it is
"researchy" - not something to run your enterprise on.  (At least, not
without a few very sharp gurus handy.) It seems like Plan 9 has been
stuck somewhere between V7 and 4.3BSD in terms of "solidity" for many
years now. This is rather sad.
