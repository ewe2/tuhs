So anyway, it seems my best bet would be getting an old "restore" and
hack it till it runs.

Part of the problem is that there are hundreds of these images, so it
would be a lot of work to examine them individually in emulated systems.
A good first start to examine the content would be to just list the file
names.

The tapes are from MIT's "Tapes of Tech Square" collection.  Likely
candidates include PDP-11 V7, 4.x BSD on VAX, and Sun workstations.  I
suppose the latter would use the big endian format.

There are also many variations of the tar and cpio formats, but I'm on
firmer ground there.
