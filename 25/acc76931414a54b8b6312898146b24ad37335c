Subject: [TUHS] Working e-mail for Henry Spencer?
Message-ID: <20160126231853.GA30456@minnie.tuhs.org>

Does anybody have a working e-mail address for Henry Spencer? I've
tried his "zoo.utoronto..." address but the box is refusing SMTP
connections (from me, at least). Alternatively, could someone e-mail
him and see if he would be interested in joining the TUHS list?

And ditto for any other old Unix users!

Cheers, Warren
