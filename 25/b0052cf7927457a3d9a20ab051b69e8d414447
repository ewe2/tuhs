I should add that in the UK the vaxes we run included "systime"
equipment: They got done for photocopying DEC boards and reselling
without licence fee, and for selling kit to the USSR.  They'd started
as a Vt100 seller. nice terminals.

Shame about the bad business practices. The headquarters was a
modernist building used for the BBC tv series "edge of darkness" and
did have the CEO's helicopter parked outside: he flew it when they
could afford the avgas.
