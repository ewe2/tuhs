Stoll mentions the worm in an epilogue to The Cuckoo's Egg; it happens
after the main events of the book. Apparently, for a brief time, some
folks thought that he might be the one behind the worm and someone
called him up and asked him if he'd written it.

Cliff Stoll talked to a number of people in law enforcement and in
government and thus made a number of contacts while he was pursuing
Markus Hess (the pursuit of Hess being the main story of The Cuckoo's
Egg): Robert Morris Sr was among those contacts. When the worm hit, he
talked to Morris Sr and asked him if he knew who started it. The
response was something along the lines of, "Yes, but I can't tell
you."
