1BSD ls.c has:

        for(;;) {
                p = &dentry;
                for (j=0; j<16; j++)
                        *p++ = getc(&inf);
                if (dentry.dinode==0
                 || aflg==0 && dentry.dname[0]=='.')
                        continue;
                if (dentry.dinode == -1)
                        break;
                ep = gstat(makename(dir, dentry.dname), 0);
                if (ep->lnum != -1)
                        ep->lnum = dentry.dinode;
                for (j=0; j<14; j++)
                        ep->lname[j] = dentry.dname[j];
        }

so it skips all that start with "." unless aflg is set from invoking ls with
-a.

I got it from the 1BSD tape that is on the CSRG archive CD-ROM set.  I had to
port ar11 to FreeBSD/i386 to get the sources out of the cont.a files.  If
anyone wants my port of ar11 I can send it to them.

ls.c starts with this block of comments:

#
/*
 * ls - list file or directory
 *
 * Modified by Bill Joy UCB May/August 1977
 *
 * This version of ls is designed for graphic terminals and to
 * list directories with lots of files in them compactly.
 * It supports three variants for listings:
 *
 *      1) Columnar output.
 *      2) Stream output.
 *      3) Old one per line format.
 *
 * Columnar output is the default.
 * If, however, the standard output is not a teletype, the default
 * is one-per-line.
 *
 * With columnar output, the items are sorted down the columns.
 * We use columns only for a directory we are interpreting.
 * Thus, in particular, we do not use columns for
 *
 *      ls /usr/bin/p*
 *
 * This version of ls also prints non-printing characters as '?' if
 * the standard output is a teletype.
 *
 * Flags relating to these and other new features are:
 *
 *      -m      force stream output.
 *
 *      -1      force one entry per line, e.g. to a teletype
 *
 *      -q      force non-printings to be '?'s, e.g. to a file
 *
 *      -c      force columnar output, e.g. into a file
 *
 *      -n      like -l, but user/group id's in decimal rather than
 *              looking in /etc/passwd to save time
 */

It's interesting they called CRTs "graphic terminals".
