C itself is going to be difficult on the PDP-8.    Too much ingrained (and
now codified by ANSI/ISO) that requires shorts to be at least 16 bits and
longs to be at least 32 bits, neither of which the 8 supports well.
Even the EAE or FP modules only added limited 24 bit support.

There are Unix-like systems for 8-bit micros which might possibly be adapted
for PDP-8.  Lunix, UZI, FUZIX...

The tiny instruction set is surprisingly versatile!
