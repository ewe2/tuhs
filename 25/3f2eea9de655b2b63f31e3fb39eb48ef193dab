Well sure, but I think this sort of reinforced Ted's point: you're not
going to run Fuschia on that machine. The machine you are describing is,
conceptually, more in the camp of the things you'd find in a big company's
datacenter rather than in an end-user's cell phone or laptop.

One of the issues with Unix/Linux-style kernels is that they try to be
"general-purpose": suitable for any number of tasks. A new direction in
systems is the realization that the software we run in datacenters doesn't
need to be the same as the software we run on our desktop machines. The big
iron in the rack doesn't necessarily need a graphics subsystem or USB
drivers for keyboards, mice, or other data-entry things, for instance; it
certainly doesn't need X11, GNOME, and on-and-on.

Fuschia's approach is the dual of this: the kernel to drive the cell phone
doesn't need datacenter-class storage support or 10Gbps networking.
