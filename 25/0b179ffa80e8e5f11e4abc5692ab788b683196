It's hard to trace. There's one on the UNSW distributions called
macro-linkr with file dates from 76 in
tuhs/Distributions/UNSW/7/source/macro-linkr (the last few elements in the
path are from an extracted tarball). The 2.9 and newer has a m11 command
that looks like a macro assembler. 2.79 (from 1980) has a number of lisp
source files that are in m11 with Harvard copyrights on them. There's a
file called 'macro' that is a binary and another called 'linkr'. The UBC
tapes posted here a while ago had rt11 emulators of various flavors (from
libraries to trap interception) and those were dated in the 76-80 time
frame. These dates seem to line up with the lisp that's on the 77 usenix
tape we have, but I've delved no further there since there's no sources.

There's also a macro/linker from stanford on the 81 tape... But it says
it's from Harvard:

NetBSD, as cool as it is,  is about a decade and a half too recent :)

The 2.9BSD and newer have the m11 sources, but they are written in m11.
I've not seen if apout can be used to compile/assemble them on modern
hardware.

It has been >>years<< since I was really familiar with any of this stuff.

Yea, that's the stuff I talked about in my talks... The files I think are
somewhere in tuhs/Applications/Usenix_77, though I've not diving in too
deeply there this morning.

The files are in the TUHS archive for the curious, but the github stuff
looks like the best place to start...

Definitely. You could spend weeks exploring this area...
