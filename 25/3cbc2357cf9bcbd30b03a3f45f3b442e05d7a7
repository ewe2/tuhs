Hello!
Egads! I remember trying out AIX (On an original RT/PC rig) at a
UNIXEXPO years ago. I found that the units were all networked
together, and used the telnet command to log into them from the first
one. Surprised the heck out of the sales 'droid that was present at
their booth. As for AIX/370 I found about it at a different event that
same year, And yes I did want a copy to try out under a certain
emulator named for a plane and mythological figure. And of course as a
guest under VM/370.
