Thanks Doug!

So Unix m6 was a port of the Fortran version, it sounds like.

Q1. When and why was it dropped from Unix? When and why did m4
enter the picture?

Q2. What's the history of Fortran on Unix?  Clearly there was a
lot of Fortran going on in 1127 (cf. BWK's book, ratfor,
software tools ...)  Who wrote the first Unix fortran compiler?

Much thanks,

Arnold
