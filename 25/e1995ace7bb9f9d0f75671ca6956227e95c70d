I think I saw that in CACM: "Prepare to throw out half your code, because 
you will anyway".

Then there was the time I saw a Uni student, when, ambling down the 
corridor at UNSW Comp Sci, he tripped and spilled the entire deck of 
cards; after laughing for a while, I helped him to put them through the 
reader-sorter (fortunately, they were sequenced, I think).

When I think back on some of the code I wrote, I still shudder...  Mind 
you, this was back in the days of the IBM-360 and the PDP-11, and I'd only 
just graduated, m'lud.
