Microsoft probably wouldn't have any problem releasing the PDP-11 version
of XENIX - it is, after all, really just a minor V7 variant with very 
little Microsoft
code in it.

The two problems you will have are:

- finding anyone at Microsoft who knows what PDP-11 XENIX is,  and 
understands that
  it has no commercial value.

- finding either a binary or source distribution of it


XENIX for the x86 family hasn't quite reached the status of "no 
commercial value" yet.
Caldera still ships XENIX compatibility with the OpenServer operating 
system,
customers still use it, and we still pay Microsoft royalties on every 
copy of OpenServer
that we ship for that very reason.
