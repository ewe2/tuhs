I can't remember 127 ever having a "paste" command. We did have "ov",
which overlaid adjacent pairs of formatted pages to make two-column
text. "Serial concatenation" would seem to be what was done by "pr"
or "cat".

"ov" figured in the flurry of demos on the day of pipes' birth.
        nroff | ov | ov
made four-column output.
