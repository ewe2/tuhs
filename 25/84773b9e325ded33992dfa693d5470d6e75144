Compiles before the return key

That phrase as i recall it i have associated with the Amdahl mainframe, not
IBM. Anyone else recall this event at a  USENIX conference???

They released a C Compiler for it and I think also a unix version for it.

the phrase that they coined to indicate the shear speed of it  at the time
went something like this -

You can compile the entire UNIX kernel in the debounce time of the return
key.

It was part of the presentation on their C compiler implementation. Perhaps
it was IBM and I need to replace some faulty core and rebuild some database
indices......

The phrase has been stuck in my head ever since.
