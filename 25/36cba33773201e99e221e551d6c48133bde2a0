All I know is the two mails from DMR from '80,

http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4BSD/usr/src/sys/newsys/sys1.c

">From dmr Thu Jan 10 04:25:49 1980 remote from research
The system has been changed so that if a file being executed
begins with the magic characters #! , [...]"

That's why I call it post-7th ed (between 7th and 8th ed) and why
I understand the above as original code (but I have no idea about
what went on with research Unix then).
Or should I interpret DMRs mail differently or with caution?
