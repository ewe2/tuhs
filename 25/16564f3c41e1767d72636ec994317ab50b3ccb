Thanks for that link!

The SysV R3 source floats around on the web. Its FSS is very different =
from what is in 8th edition.

In 8th edition the switch has 11 entries (i.e. a file system is an =
object with 11 virtual methods).

I have never really studied R3 but at quick inspection the FSS there has =
27 (!) entries and seems to be more a sys call switch.

In 10th edition it is still 11 entries, although some refactoring has =
taken place. Also later work from Research keeps it concise: the 9P =
protocol from Plan 9 has 14 messages.
