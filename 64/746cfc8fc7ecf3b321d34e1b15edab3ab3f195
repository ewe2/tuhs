Hi Don,

Did some variation of this appear in CACM?

    The Internet Worm Incident

    As Rick Adams of the Center for Seismic Studies observed in a
    posting to the Usenet, we may someday hear that the Worm was
    actually written to impress Jodie Foster â€” we simply do not know the
    real reason.
