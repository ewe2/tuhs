Steven Schultz is still the canonical source for 2.11BSD patches. He
sends them to me and I add them to the TUHS archive.

Recently I asked him to roll a new install tape which had all the patches
applied, at https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/UCB/2.11BSD_patch457

I know somebody tried a while back and reported here. They found it wasn't
possible to apply all the patches sequentially. I'd have to go look in
the mail archive for details.

Maybe it's time for someone else to have a go!

Cheers, Warren
