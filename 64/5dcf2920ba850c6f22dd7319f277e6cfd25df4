As for archive stats, my copy is some 11GB (but I have expanded a number
of subtrees and added a few things). It changes very little if any at all
usually, meaning that monthly traffic for syncing is negligible.

BTW, I'm supposed to be hooked on a 2Gbps pipe, but since we mirror many
huge biological databases (in the order of TB) and they may change by day
significantly, and other sites use us as a hub to mirror their copy of
said dbs in turn, out bandwidth may vary depending on day and time of
day (if you hit us during the mirroring phase of the day it may be quite
slow). We're also on the Grid running large jobs with large data moves...

Oh well. Just give it a try. BTW, on our site you'll also find an 'os'
directory with a large collection of additional UNIX/UNIX-like/other
systems and sources (ftp://ftp.es.embnet.org/pub/misc/os/ or
rsync://ftp.es.embnet.org/tuhs/ ).
