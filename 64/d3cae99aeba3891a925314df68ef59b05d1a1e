Let's see how much this thread can drift...

The venerable PDP-8 was introduced in 1965 today (or tomorrow if you're on 
the wrong side of the date line).  It was the first computer I ever used, 
back around 1970 (I think I'd just left school and was checking out the 
local University's computer department, and played with BASIC and FOCAL).

And (hopefully) coincidentally the Pentium first shipped in 1993; the 
infamous FDIV defect was discovered a year later (and it turned out that 
Intel was made aware of it by a post-grad student a bit earlier), and what 
followed next was an utter farce, with some dealers refusing to accept the 
results of a widely-distributed program as evidence of a faulty FPU.
