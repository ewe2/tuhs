I deleted all the code I wrote at Sun but there was a great toolkit, 
I want to say xview?  Can't remember the name right now but it was
a really pleasant API, it was

interface(key, val, key, val, key, val, ... END);

and all interfaces took that and all had sensible defaults.  So you passed
in stuff to change the defaults.

I wrote a bunch of GUI tools for what was the system before BitKeeper in
that toolkit.  As a non-gui person, I found it really pleasant.
