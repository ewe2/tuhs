man woman
make love
cat "tin of catfood"

the first two were easter eggs. the last one was just assonance from
"cannot open" error message.

I think they were always tolerated.

the ADA specification"

out of the compiler messages section: it was tickling the test harness
and didn't meet compliance (or so I was told)
