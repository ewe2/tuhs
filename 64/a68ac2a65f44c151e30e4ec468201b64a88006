I haven't got a live 2.11 system anywhere near but the following occurs 
to me.

1) I think that the GENERIC kernel only has 2 RL02s configured and will 
expect these on device selects 0 and 1.  The idea is to get the generic 
going and then rebuild for your specific config.

2) Are all of your RL02s on one controller?.  If not then two things 
occur. The first is that I think the GENERIC kernel is only configured 
for one controller.  Secondly, if the second drive is on the second 
controller then the physical select will probably be 8 and the device 
will probably be rl8a.

3) If the SCSI controller emulates an MSCP device then I think that 2 
MSCP discs are configured for the GENERIC kernel.  Again, if you need 
more then you will need to rebuild the kernel.

Although the generic kernel is configured for a lot of devices they will 
not necessarily be attached if the appropriate file in /etc doesn't have 
the rems taken out.  Can't remember the file name but that will need the 
appropriate controllers to have the rems taken out.

I assume that you can mount rl0 and rl1 from your note.  Load the kernel 
sources onto these two discs, You should be able to get everything 
except the usr src onto the two rl02s.  Then create a kernel that has 
only the devices that you need and then you should see everything that 
you have.

The autoconfig system is not as informative as newer OS's but it will 
tell you if something is detected that the kernel is configured for.  If 
it exists but the kernel knows nothing about it then autoconfig will not 
display it.

If I am attempting to teach my grandmother to suck eggs then forgive me.

Cheers

Robin
