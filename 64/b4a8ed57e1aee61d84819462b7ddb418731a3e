There is more in that issue of BSTJ, and indeed it seems this was a =
precursor.

The first paper makes mention of repeaters starting to self oscillate, =
and a redesign being underway.

There is a possibility that a Unix PDP11 was connected to this earlier =
network prior to Spider existing, in which case the accepted quiz answer =
would be wrong.
