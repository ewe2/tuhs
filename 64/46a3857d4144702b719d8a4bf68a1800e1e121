Same.  Though vi in ex mode was also good.

I also got a little corrupted by whatever editor came with BDS C, my=20
=2Eexrc looks like this:


map # :.,$
map @ :1,.

Those came from that editor, # says do whatever to the end of the file,
@ says do whatever from the top of the file to here.

map , !}fmt=0D

This came from Udi Manber, , runs your paragraph through fmt

map! =01 =14

I set shiftwidth to 4 spaces because when you have code like

	if ((this big thing =3D=3D that big thing) && (this other big thing) &&
	    (yet another big thing)) {

I use 4 spaces for what I call the continuation line.  I used ^A to write
that example, why I don't like ^T is lost to me.

And yeah, I paren stuff that doesn't need to have parens, it just makes
the code more obvious.

set redraw ai aw terse=20

redraw I think is left over from modems, autoident because duh,=20
autowrite because who doesn't hack, hack, hack, ^Z, !cc?  terse
because I'm not a newbie.

set sections=3DuhshSHNH
set paragraphs=3DPSPETSTEFSFEKSKECSCERSREDSDEIPNPLPPPTLABAIAELIB1B2HH

Troff.

set ts=3D8 sw=3D4
set shell=3D/bin/sh
set showmode
set textwidth=3D1000
set vb

Etc.

I've been carrying around that .exrc for around 40 years.  Sheesh, I'm old.
