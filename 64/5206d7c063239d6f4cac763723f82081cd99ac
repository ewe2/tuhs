I don't think I've installed RedHat in years, honestly. I believe
you that it's a smooth process.

But define "Linux" here. Do you mean RedHat, specifically? Because
with Arch, you've got to manually run `fdisk` or `gdisk` or whatever, and
add partitions in that tool, set their type manually, etc, then manually
create the filesystems, install the boot loader and configure it. The steps
aren't necessarily hard, but it is tedious. The FreeBSD installer, on the
other hand, does pretty much all of that for you. My point is that YMMV
widely between Linux distributions, which vary between extremes of,
"manually partition the disk" and "this graphical wizard does all the nasty
stuff for you" and FreeBSD is somewhere between those two.

Huh. I remember before GPT you had to manually create MBR partitions
and, if you wanted more than 3 or 4 (or whatever the number was...) you
had to go and explicity create an extended partition and then subdivide
that. With FreeBSD, you just created one MBR partition and then the
installer let you create filesystems within that using their pseudo-graphical
installer (pseudo- in the sense that it was all text-based, but at least it
was menu driven if that was your bag). I found whatever Linux distribution
I was installing at the time a lot more complex than FreeBSD, but I get
that individuals differ here.

Then again, I care a _lot_ less about carefully dividing my disk up into
different filesystems these days. Back in the day, especially on multiuser
machines, you had to either due to limitations in the filesystem code
(2GB FFS partitions!) or to keep random users from filling up / or /usr.
Most of the need for that kind of subdivision has gone away.

Oh, absolutely!

The world that might have been.

I was thinking more about the ABI compatibility stuff that Ted had mentioned,
and the more I think about it, the less I think that the kernel ABI is all that
relevant. Yes, it's nice that you can take a binary compiled on one distribution
of Linux and drop it onto another distribution and it will
theoretically run because
the system call numbers will mostly line up and the convention for trapping into
the kernel is basically stable, but that's only part of the equation,
and for any
non-trivial binaries, you've also got to make sure that a whole slew of shared
libraries are installed and the correct version (hence why my colleague can't
use the Salae controller software on his Arch machine). To compensate, we've
built up a huge amount of complexity around containers and flatpaks and all of
that stuff, which sometimes doesn't work; not to mention moving across ISAs.
A stable kernel ABI may be necessary, but it's definitely not sufficient.
