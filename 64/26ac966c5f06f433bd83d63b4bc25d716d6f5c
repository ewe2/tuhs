Well, you were right, sim didn't want to build 64 bit. However, I 
already had a working sim, so I simply used the existing pdp11 binary 
and your instructions. They worked!

In the process, I figured out that the original approach that I used 
worked as well. The issue wasn't with the RP disk, it was with the 
singular lack of a Boot prompt '@'. There isn't one. After the simulator 
prints 'Disabling XQ', the boot loader is just sitting there waiting for 
the user to type 'boot', at which point the loader will print 'Boot' and 
the ':' prompt will appear, allowing the kernel to be specified:

pdp11 tboot.ini
PDP-11 simulator V4.0-0 Beta        git commit id: 0f43551d
Disabling XQ
boot
Boot
: hp(0,0)unix
mem = 2020544

Thanks Hellwig and thanks Cole!

Regards,

Will
