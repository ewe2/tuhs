It was streams, not STREAMS.

STREAMS are outside the limited scope I try to restrain myself to, but =

What in the above case drove/caused the poor performance?

There was a debate on the LKML in the late 1990=E2=80=99s where Caldera =

that STREAMS would make =E2=80=98zero copy=E2=80=99 networking =
impossible. If so, then it is a comment more about the underlying buffer =
strategy than STREAMS itself.

Did STREAMS also perform poorly in the 1986 context they were developed =
in?

*) Other arguments pro- and con included forward maintenance and market =
need, but I=E2=80=99m not so interested in those aspects of the debate.
