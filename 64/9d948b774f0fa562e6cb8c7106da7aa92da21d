Hoi,

my Aha moments were (in no particular order):

- Users can change their login shell! -- This surely was the most
  impressing discovery for me.

- Users are regarded as programmers and are provided with
  structurally all possiblities, i.e. you can recreate the whole
  system to your preferences within your home directory and use
  that as the default.

- The shell as a fluid way from dumb programm calling to full
  programming, where any user can float up and down the level,
  based on personal skills and the problem at hand.

- Chroot (Linux from Scratch)

- To me it's actually more a philosophy behind it all, and UNIX
  itself ist more a demonstration and the scientific experiment
  that helped to uncover and shape this philosophy. The Aha moment
  was that there is so much behind it.

- Those guys implemented about anything there is about an
  operating system and application tools, and -- what is even
  more impressive -- in each of those fields (typesetting, fonts,
  chess, languages, and so on for a long time), they went deep
  and invented there as well. Such a small group and so hugely
  much and deep output!
