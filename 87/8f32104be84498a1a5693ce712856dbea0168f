Greetings,

Multics, while not a 'massive' sales success in retrospect, was certainly no=
t the failure commonly believed and wasn't treated as one in the press of th=
e time - at least not until after the decision was made by Honeywell-Bull to=
 phase out the the Multics (and CP-6) products to focus on GCOS - GCOS7/GCOS=
8 is still a major player today.

"Honeywell is having considerable =E2=80=94 and surprising =E2=80=94 success=
 with the ultra-secure Multics operating system =E2=80=A6 Besides 3-5 system=
s within Honeywell, Multics has been installed or committed within Nippon El=
ectric, Rome Air Development Center, USAF Data Services Center, and Ford." f=
rom mid-1970's industry press.

We have about 120 members on BAN - including many original and new Multician=
s who make the project possible. We're always working on new things and proj=
ects - see "pmotd -a" when logged in for some of the most recent activity.

I'd be happy to answer any questions on BAN.AI if anyone has particular ques=
tions - or just ssh to dps8@m.trnsz.com - feel free to use the guest account=
. I don't want to take the list too off-topic. We have many exclusive featur=
es that I hope makes BAN.AI a 'special' (and loved) system, a lot more comin=
g.
