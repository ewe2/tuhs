Some other people already mentioned this, but... - SIXBIT. DEC might 
have used baudot in the very early machines, but I would say that SIXBIT 
dominated here for a long time. We see it both in the PDP-8, but also 
the PDP-6 and its follow ons. RAD50 was the natural extension of SIXBIT 
on a machine that did not have a word size that was a multiple of 6.

The x.y filename, as well as the 6+3 pattern predate the PDP-11. I would 
say that in this area, the PDP-11 didn't come with anything new, but 
just made life more complicated.

OS/8 for sure only have 6+2 filenames, but still in the x.y form. 
TOPS-10 have, I think, 6+3. And the Monitor (I think that was the name 
for the PDP-6 OS) was, I think, also 6+3.
And it was all SIXBIT.

And SIXBIT also give you the case folding.

I say the PDP-11 complicated life just because DEC was already so much 
into having filenames stored more compact than normal text, and having a 
6+3 pattern, so they came up with R50, which fits the bill, but it's 
more headache than it was worth, if you ask me.
Since the PDP-11 have 8 bit bytes, it would have made much more sense to 
just store filenames as 8 bit bytes. It would have cost some more 
storage, but not that much. But it took time for DEC to realize that the 
space savings here were not really a good tradeoff. Old habits die hard, 
I guess.

By the way, RSX (and early VMS) actually use 9+3 filenames.

I think I agree on the point of having filenames in a free format. Not 
sure I really like storing the type in the file itself. So I'm sortof 
torn. Or rather, I would like to keep type separate from both.
