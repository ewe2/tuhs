Err, V4? :-) At least, that's when pipes arrived (I think - we don't have V4
sources, but there are indications that's when they appeared), and a pipe is a
FIFO. RAND ports just allowed (effectively) a pipe to have a name in the file
system.

The implementation of both is pretty straight-forward. A pipe is just a file
which has a maximum length, after which the writer is blocked. A port is
just a pipe (it uses the pipe code) whose inode appears in the file system.

Doc is here:

  https://minnie.tuhs.org//cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=BBN-V6/doc/ipc

and sources for all that are here:

 https://minnie.tuhs.org//cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=BBN-V6/dmr
 https://minnie.tuhs.org//cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=BBN-V6/ken

(port.c is in 'dmr', not 'ken'where it should be).
