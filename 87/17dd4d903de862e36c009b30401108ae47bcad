"Use the source, Luke!" V7 is simple enough that it's pretty quick to find
the answers to things like this. E.g.

  http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V7/usr/sys/dev/tty.c>

will answer this question (in "canon()").

A quick look through tty.c suggests this doesn't exist in V7 - without running
a user program that puts the TTY in 'raw' mode and prints out what it
sees. Not sure if there is one off the rack, or if you'd have to whip up a
20-line program to do it.
