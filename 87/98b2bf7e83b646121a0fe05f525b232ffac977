There seems to be some confusion about exactly what was removed to
create 'lite'.

http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2012-April/004227.html lists three files.

and

https://github.com/weiss/original-bsd

appears to have copies of these three files (so they were probably not
actually deleted from the original version control)

https://github.com/weiss/original-bsd/commit/e58c89522e6fbf136e9cdf55a393a6bdbdc4eb45#diff-771e2cfcd8808541adc96aa1fa1a0aae

is interesting!

I wonder how many systems actually ever displayed the "4.4 BSD UNIX"
banner? At least one did at UCB.
