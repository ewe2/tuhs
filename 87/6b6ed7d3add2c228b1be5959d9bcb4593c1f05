Correct.  And I would often suspend the shell when I didn't need to
use the Kerberos administration credentials, and then go back to it
later when I did need it, and since I was often bouncing back and
forth between the sub-shell and the parent shell, having the SHLVL
displayed in the prompt for non-top-level shells was useful.

For similar reasons, my shell prompt will also display what git branch
I happen to be one.  For example:

<tytso@lambda> {/usr/projects/e2fsprogs/e2fsprogs-maint}, level 2   (debian/master)
1001% 

Says that I'm on the debian/master git branch, and "level 2" indicates
that I'm in a subshell.  (If I'm in a top level shell, no level will
be printed at all.)  The prompt also displays the hostname ("lambda"
in this case") which is super-useful to identify remote logins.
