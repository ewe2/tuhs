My pet theory is that Acme was going to replace Rio, at which time it
would be 'the interface' again instead of a text editor with a
slightly-incompatible filesystem interface.  There are some hints toward
this if you squint hard enough, but I can't prove it.
       
"Unavailable on the console" is kind of a cheap shot when talking about
an operating system that deliberately doesn't support consoles.  Part of
the point was outgrowing TTYs.
       
The emacs comparison is a favorite of mine because it's so close to
being an anagram, but obviously Acme never suffered from lisp fetishism.
I still dislike Acme for basically all the same reasons I dislike emacs.
