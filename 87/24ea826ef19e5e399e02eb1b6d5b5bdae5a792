My bad, permissions fixed. Assuming you have downloaded the git repository
and you have a directory you want converted into a tarball to feed into
the site5 system:

$ bsdtar cf - <directory> | ./mktape /dev/stdin > site5.tap

Then inside the simulated system

# mt rew
# tar vxf /dev/rmt12

Cheers, Warren
