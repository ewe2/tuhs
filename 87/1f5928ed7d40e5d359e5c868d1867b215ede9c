Hi all,

Some years ago, I did part of the proof-reading for the UTP revival
project (UTP = the book "Unix Text Processing", the original sources of
the book were sadly lost) since I happened to own a copy of the book
itself and quite enjoyed using troff for all sorts of things.

If anyone's interested, I believe the final product (PDf and sources)
may be found at
