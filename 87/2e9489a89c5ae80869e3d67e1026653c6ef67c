Um, I remember this very differently.  The early split between NetBSD
and FreeBSD was a friendly disagreement over whether to continue to be
cross-platform (NetBSD) or go for maximum performance on x86 (FreeBSD).

The only event that fits your description is OpenBSD, which got forked
off because Theo de Raadt's abrasive personality managed to get him
kicked out of the NetBSD core team, and banned from both NetBSD and
FreeBSD mailing list.
