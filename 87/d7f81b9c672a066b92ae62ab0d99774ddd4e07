Subject: [TUHS] making VAX disk file images
Message-ID: <200403061101.09485.wes.parish@paradise.net.nz>

I've got OpenVMS 7.3 and am planning on installing it under the SIMH/TS10 VAX.  
How do I go about making disk file images?

None of the SIMH/TS10 files seem to include a Linux utility for making such a 
creature - does anyone have any pointers?

Thanks
