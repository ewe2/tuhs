Here is what the Lions' Commentary actually says:

This is a specially edited selection of code from the Level Six
version of UNIX, as received by us in December, 1975. ... The
principal editorial changes to the sourcecode are as follows:

 +  the order of presentation of files has been changed;
 +  the order of material within several files has been changed;
 +  to a very limited extent, code has been transferred between
    files (with hindsight a lot more of this would have been desirable);
 +  about 5% of the lines have been shortened in various ways to
    less than 66 characters (by elimination of blanks, rearrangement
    of comments, splitting into two lines, etc .);
 +  a number of comments consisting of a line of underscore characters
    have been introduced, particularly at the end of procedures;
 +  the size of each file has been adjusted to an exact multiple
    of 50 lines by padding with blank lines;

The source code has been printed in double column format with fifty
lines per column, giving one hundred lines per sheet (or page).
Thus there is a convenient relationship between line numbers and
sheet numbers.

Cheers,
	Warren
