This is from my system - check to see if what you have are different

Where did you see that?  Possible of course, but less likely.   PWB 1.0 was
not released outside of BTL.  Parts leaked to some of the Universities and
the MIT systems were famously PWBish, so it's possible it leaked from MIT
to BBN.  AGN is the comments -- Al Nemeth who is a friend of mine and Al
told me in those days, BBN was pretty spooked about where UNIX stuff came
from at BBN.

I think it's more likely if something is not stock V6, is using the
typesetter C compiler - which is the compiler described in K&R1 and would
later be part of V7 and PWB 2.0.  That was released independently a lot of
places had it and if you upgraded your V6 system to it, it was hard to go
backward.

Could not a ton of things - where is stopping -- use simh to get an address
and then check then look UNIX symbol table and see what routine you are in
and see if you can egt a hint.

Should not need it - you can make sure /dev entry is nuked for it.   check
c.c and see what entry it was -- it should be commented it.   The look in
/dev and rm the entry so you don's accidentially try to open

See comments -- I'm thinking this might not be PWB -- but if it is then go
to gunkies and get Noel's MIT system maybe.

Yep - done many times - also if you use a 45 or 70, make the compiler image
split I/D that helps too.   Although we ran them on 40s all the time - even
before Fred's overlay code.
