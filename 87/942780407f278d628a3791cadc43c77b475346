Syntax is a separate issue.  Something like what Macsyma (or
Maxima now) or even LaTeX would be fine. Many word processors
and browsers can render the latter properly. Syntax is the
easy part (though it can be controversial).  The hard part is
having to build in a tremendous amount of math knowledge. Even
if the compiler/interpreter were to outsource the symbolic
algebra manipulation part to maxima, mathematica or some such,
smooth integration with other language features would not be easy.
