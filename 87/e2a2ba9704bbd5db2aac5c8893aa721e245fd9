I just rebuilt everything from scratch and using the images created by
imgbuild I can't get unix to boot.

If I build the cold image use an old tape it works fine.

Are the rf0.dsk images know to boot clean w/o cold?

(I wonder if it's not just a permissions problem on /etc/init)

ps: you won't be able to change the TTIX (DL) address in simh without a patch;
