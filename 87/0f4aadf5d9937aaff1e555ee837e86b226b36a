It is not necessary to have a plan 9 environment to take advantage of Sam,
and there was once a port for Unix that worked outside of the usual Plan 9
world. Indeed, Sam got its start on Unix.

However, I dare say that the best port to use is the one from plan9port:
Sam continued to evolve on plan9, if only gaining incremental improvements
after the early Unix years. By using the plan9port version, you'll pick up
on those changes (though I can't really enumerate them anymore).
