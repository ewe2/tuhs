I want just want to add to this comment Clem.  You are spot on in my
experience.  It's one of the bright spots of our industry, in my 
opinion (I can imagine that there are people who will disagree, this
is just what I've seen).

In my experience, nobody cared if you were male, female, gay, lesbian,
transgender, whatever, it was all cool if you could figure out this 
kernel panic, we'll kiss your ass (well, maybe not that but we'll buy
dinner at Harry's Hafbrau and that's better than a kiss).

I've watched a tech writer go from female to dude to female and nobody
cared, she was a good tech writer.

I'm sure there are people that will disagree but the world I lived in 
was super welcoming to people being different, all we cared about was
can you do your job.
