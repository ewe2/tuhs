	Ah ha!  For moving filesystems dump+restor or 'afio' need to be
	used.   Dump+restor also have the advantage of preserving the
	file flags (see chflags(2) and chflags(1)) - other utilities do
	not preserve that metadata.

	The other thing that dump+restor (or afio) handle correctly is
	the special files in /dev.  'tar' does not know how to archive
	files such as "/dev/rp0a".

	Mmmm, I wonder if the problems you were having  were caused by
	/dev not being correctly populated.

	Yes, they do look (more than a little bit) strange.

	On my system here (a P11 based emulated PDP-11 - I have a real 11/73
	but it is only powered up when I'm actively testing):

Filesystem  1K-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/xp0a        8228     3163     5065    38%    /
/dev/xp0h      155328    84188    71140    54%    /usr

	What patchlevel did you mention the system was at?   There were a lot
	of patches issued after the ' 2.11_rp_unknown' image was created.
	One thing, which probably will not make any difference, to try would
	be to recompile 'df' (and possibly 'libc') and see if the problem
	changes.   Looks like it's a math error of some kind so either
	the compiler/libraries are broken or P11's having a problem doing
	arithmetic.

	Cheers,
