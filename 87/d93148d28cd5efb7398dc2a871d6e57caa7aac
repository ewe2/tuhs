If you like sdiff check out this:

You have to install BitKeeper to get it but that's easy, go to bitkeeper.org
and hit the download button.  You don't have to use BK for source management,
you can do

	bk difftool A B
	bk difftool file dir	# dir means dir/file

and you get the highlighting that makes sdiff jealous.
