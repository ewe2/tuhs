Yes, on a DECUS tape with VMS software.  I'm not sure it runs on VMS,
though.

This link sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.  But I have it mirrored.

I haven't tried to compile it, but my guess would be 4.2 ish BSD.
Whatever BSD was contemporary around 1985 I suppose.

I did try 16.56 on 4.1BSD, but it wasn't an immediate success.  Some
things seemed to be missing from BSD.

4.3BSD came with a copy of GNU Emacs 17.61.
