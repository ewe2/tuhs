I'm not sure that I have anything to add beyond repeating citation to 
https://notes.technologists.com/notes/2017/03/08/lets-start-at-the-very-beginning-801-romp-rtpc-aix-versions/. 
It credits ISC and LCC appropriately.

AIX involvement with SCO, if any, would have been after I left IBM. I 
find it hard to imagine what that involvement would have been.
