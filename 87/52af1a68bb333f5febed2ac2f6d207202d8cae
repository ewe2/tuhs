The qe driver does appear to recognize the DELQA.  Same results as with
the DEQNA.  It sees it, recognizes the ethernet address I configured it
with, and the network configuration all seems to work, but once it's all
up I can't get anywhere.

I couldn't say.  I just tried setting the arp information for the gateway
in 2.11BSD, but to no avail.

I just tried it, also to no avail.

tcpdump isn't showing me any packets coming from or to the IP or ethernet
address of the emulated PDP-11.
