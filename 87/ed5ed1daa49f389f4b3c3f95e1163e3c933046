dc, along with ed and I guess awk if we can put it here, is one of my
favorite Unix programs that I use daily.  I don't even have a "normal"
calculator installed.  It just smells like Unix.

There is something sexy about reverse Polish notation.  I really do
encourage everyone reading this to try dc as their "desk calculator"
for some time.
