Yes, I know you said 1972, and I said 1973.
For 1972 I only found the 11/40 handbook. But, as I said, that handbook 
also says "page". If you have some link to the version you refer to, it 
would be interesting.

Told you I searched around in different handbooks from that era, and 
found none who said segments.
