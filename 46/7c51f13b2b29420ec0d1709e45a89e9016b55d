SunOS for the Sun3 machines was derived from BSD 4.2 with a lot of
code from other places.  BSD 4.2 requires an AT&T license because
there is still AT&T code in it.  As such, open sourcing it would be
difficult at best.

Based on what friends that work at sun tell me, the source can still
be obtained internally if necessary...  I never pressed them for
details on the rather curious way they put it (like I did just now).
