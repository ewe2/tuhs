My understanding is that initially Linux project was much simpler
and minimalistic than BSD, which in the late 80s was already a very bloated
O/S as compared to UNIX V6/V7.  And it was also one of the reasons some
folks preferred it.  It was kind of like moving back in time to times of
hacking on V6 for new generation of hackers.  Pure fun.  Minimalism is what
initially brought me to Unix.

Of course today Linux is as bloated Windows, thats why some people prefer
to hack on simpler projects like FUZIX (Alan Cox).
