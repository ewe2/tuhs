Tru64 was about 18 months later.=20

In the early days of Alpha, I was at DEC=E2=80=99s Cambridge Research =
Laboratory (directed then by Vic Vyssotsky, having retired from Bell =
Labs). The lab had various connections to Alpha projects, and we learned =
that there were (I think) 7 different C compilers running on the early =
port of Ultrix. That number, I think, did not include the port of gcc =
that DEC was funding outside the company.

Andy Payne, a recent hire at the lab, had been an intern in DEC=E2=80=99s =
semiconductor group, where he had worked on randomized testing for =
hardware verification. With all the compilers available, he decided to =
hack up a program to generate random small C programs with computable =
expected outputs. His program then compiled the random code with each =
compiler and tested the result. After finding a number of bugs this way, =
he got tired of submitting the bug reports, and changed his program to =
write and submit the bug reports automatically.=20

This caused a little bit of consternation with some of the compiler =
teams at first.

Eventually, this led to some collaboration with the DEC languages and =
tools team, and Bill McKeeman published a paper that line of work in the =
Digital Technical Journal in 1998[1].
