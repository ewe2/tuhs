Has anyone gotten their "Antique Source Code License" yet?

I sent in my signed contract to the SCO 3/11/98, but I haven't heard
a thing.

This is the word from Dion, as at 1st April:

	Well, we have 12 licenses accumulated here and I haven't got any
	"system" set up to deal with these.  I will probably just send
	you a list of the peoples' names and addresses by postal mail.
	Hope that's not too primitive.

I asked if he could send me the list via PGP email, but he countered
that they were all on paper, and he didn't have the time to send me the
list. However, he did say:

	I will just drop them into a DHL or similar express shipment
	thing.  Hopefully in a day or two.

Now, I'm not sure if this means:

	+ he will ship the licenses in a day or two,
	+ he will ship me the list in a day or two,
	+ it will only take a day or two for the list to reach me.

However, the worst-case scenario is that the licenses will be posted
in a day or two, and they should reach you quickly after that.

I checked my bank account, and SCO removed $100 on the 24th March.
I take this to indicate that I am now licensed. I don't know if this
is of much help, though.

I am waiting in anticipation, as we all are.

BTW First person to announce their license in the mailing list wins.
Wins what, I haven't a clue ;-)

I was just browsing for web pages related to PDP-11s and UNIX, and I found:

	http://idefix-45.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/museum/pdp/unix-E.html

which has a most interesting paragraph at the bottom:

	Officially Digital Equipment did not support Unix. With the
	maintenance technicians we made the agreement that the hardware was
	OK, when their test programs did not produce error messages.

	At the end of 1983 we found out that within Digital there was a
	very small group which distributed Unix V7 with support and drivers
	for all PDP 11 models and devices. Sources were distributed freely to
	all source licensees of Bell labs. From then on we have used that
	distribution. 

Does anybody know what `distribution from within Digital' is being
referred to here, and how I can get my hands on it, for the archive.
Is this an early Ultrix?

I've mailed the maintainer of the web page in question for more information.

	I have an Edition 7 distribution from DEC. The work was largely
done by Fred Canter, along with Jerry Brenner and Armando Stettner. It
had prebuilt kernels as follows :-

	CPU	Disk	Tape
	11/23	RL02	TU10
	11/34	RK06	TE10
	11/40	RK07	TU16
	11/60	RM02	TE16
	11/44	RM03	TS11
	11/45	RP03	
	11/70	RP04
		RP05
		RP06

	I have a 1600bpi tape, but haven't tried to read it lately.

Never looked at it as its apparently a tarball and all my systems with

Briefly, Jean tells me the stuff I saw on his web page (early DEC support)
is called UNIX V7M RELEASE 2.1. There's a copy of _a_ V7M in the archive, but
I've asked Jean to look at his tape so we can compare contents.

John Holden, as you saw, also has a tape with lots of pre-built kernels.
I've asked John if we can get a copy of this tape too.

A few people mentioned Ultrix for the PDP-11. This is probably a dumb
question, but I assume DEC still owns these systems. Would it be possible
(and/or worth it) to ask DEC to make it freely available to licensees?

I guess we could ask Bob Supnik about it.

Thanks again,
	Warren

All,
	I've just received this reply from Bob Supnik on PDP-11 Ultrix: 


> If you can clear the other license issues (SCO's) Digital would have no
> problem giving a free license to its value add, whatever that was.
>
> That is, if the user can obtain a valid license from SCO, either binary
> or source, Digital will agree to license its portion at no cost under

I asked him if DEC would permit us to distribute Ultrix to LICENSEES ONLY,
if some license agreement was also distributed. Awaiting a reply....

	Warren

P.S Ken, Allison, can you send in some tape images??? Thanks 8-)

More evidence of a bug is that 'vi' doesn't work right under Bob
Supnik's emulator, either.  At one point Steven Schultz made some
private speculations to me about where the problem might be, but
I've forgotten the details.  Is it possible that these two bugs
are both due to FP emulation?  Does the 2.11BSD 'vi' even use
the FP registers?

Don't know about vi FP, I could go have a look at the source. No, vi
doesn't appear to use any floating point.

I asked Bob about the factor(6) bug in my Ultrix mail, he didn't mention
it, but he might at some stage. I'll keep people informed.

As for vi, what was the abnormal behaviour?

	To the best of my knowledge 'vi' does NOT use any FP at all (other than
	the usual 32 bit arithmetic that all programs do if they do any 'long'
	arithmetic).

	My speculation is that there's a MMU emulation bug somewhere.  'vi' is
	a overlaid split I/D program.  Overlays in 2.11BSD are done via
	'page flipping' (altering MMU registers).  Also 2.11 uses the 'expand
	downward' bit on the stack (as well as relying on MMR3 - i think that's
	the one - for instruction restart after growing the stack).  If there's
	a subtle gotcha in the MMU emulation that will cause problems 
	eventually.  2.11 is not alone in using the ED bit and instruction
	restart - if the problem is MMU related it could show up under other
	systems (V7).   It would be interesting to know if 'vi' encountered
	problems on V7 but V7 doesn't have usermode overlays so getting 'vi'
	to run would be very problematic.

	Steven

The 2bsd distribution in the archive comes with an early non-overlayed vi
which compiles on V7. However, I haven't got it to work correctly yet. I
suspect that the /etc/termcap entry I was using is not recognised by this
early version of termlib.

This is all irrelevant to the emulator bug, BTW.
Steven, have you mentioned your hypothesis to Bob?

In old movies, filmmakers often focused on spinning tape 
drives when they wanted to show a computer "thinking."  What is it 
about tape drives that made them such a powerful symbol for big, 
complicated computer systems?

Was dectape an attempt to remedy some of these problems?  My 
hazy recollection was that you could treat dectape in some ways as if 
it were a disk.

How much data can magtape hold?  If magtape was a portable media, 
does that mean that the manufacturers agreed on the width of 
the tape, the density of recording, the method of recording bits, 
etc.?

I have an old 9 track tape from a computer course I took in 1980.  
For sentimental reasons I'd love to get a copy of its contents.  Is 
this possible do you think?

Dectape was an attempt to achive moderate amount of storage at low cost 
with good reliability.  It's stop, turnaround time was poor but the cost 
was very low.  It was preceeded by linktape which was very much similar.

To a point.

Highly likely if you can find someone with a drive.

<Is 'merge sort' an example of an application that required three tape 
<drives?

Thats a typical one.  Sometimes 4 drives were used plus maybe a disk
system.  Two for source material, one for intermediate results, one or
more for programs and the last for final results.  Some machines were
very limited in the local memory they had so programs often were broken 
into small modules and loaded (chained) as needed on the fly.  Imagine
processing 500k of data in a 16k memory where a portion was also used 
for program code.

FWIW, I've used the latest (and not yet committed) version of the
Begemot emulator to run 2.11BSD for over a week.  In that time, I
applied multiple patches to the system.  I did have some as yet
unexplained problems with the assembler, which Steven Schultz
considers to be due to the emulator (more specifically, instruction
restart), but Hartmut Brandt (the principal author) thinks this is
unlikely.  vi works as well as vi ever works.

It's the one I've been using all along.  I never used an older version.

Sure, that makes sense.  I did too, but I couldn't see anything obvious.

Well, not quite.  I finally got back to the real work I should have
been doing, and I haven't had time to look at it again since.  But
they went into hiding when I tried to show them to Hartmut :-) I think
we still have a problem somewhere.  BTW, Hartmut had already upgraded
to PL 40? before I tried to start, so I'm still not completely
convinced that it's not something I did wrong in upgrading.

Interesting.  I was running this on an AMD K6/233, which should be
slower than a PPro, and I had the impression it was faster.  Does
anybody have some benchmarks?

I don't have numbers for anything running under the emulator, but I do have
Dhrystone sources (and some figures for real PDP-11s of various sorts with
various operating systems and compilers).  If anyone wants to try it, I can
post the source.

I'd be very surprised if factor used FP.  My 7th Edition system's offline ATM,
so I can't check the source.

Well, it is one of the areas that causes trouble on different flavours of
PDP-11.  Both DEC and Unix O/S's had all sorts of games being played in the
trap recovery code, according to which processor the O/S thought it was running
under.  But AFAIK, that code only gets called if an instruction is aborted,
which I wouldn't expect would happen exactly the same way every time factor was
run (but again, I'm speculating without having looked at the code).

Yes, in the sense that you could perform random-access operations on it.  I
used a PDP-8 that had twin DECtape instead of disks.  It supported 4(?)
teletypes in a multi-user environment.  But DECtape was not 1/2" tape, nor did
it use reels like the ones that later became standard.

Yes to all of those, though there are three standard recording densities
(80bpi, 1600bpi, 6250bpi) and several recording methods (NRZ, NRZI, PE, etc).
 There are different standard lengths too:  600' 1200' 2400'.

Shouldn't be hard, unless it's suffered from print-through after 18 years.
 It's probably 800bpi (NRZI) or 1600bpi (PE).  Whether you can understand the
contents depends on the format of the data, of course.

You have to realize that disk storage on mainframe systems in the
1960's was usually quite small.  Almost all "large-scale" processing
was from tape drive(s) to tape drive(s).  If you find a really good
reference on sorting and collating (Knuth, for example) a lot of
effort is made on doing things with as little core and disk space
as possible.  Most of these methods are still used today on really
large data sets (for example, FFT's on multi-gigabyte data sets
which are never entirely in memory.)

DECtape was very much different from other tape media of the time.
You didn't treat it as a disk in just some ways, you treated it as
a disk in all ways.

At the time of DECtape, the most inexpensive removable disk media was
the RK05 DECpack, which cost about $150-$200 per platter.  DECtape was
created as a more affordable "disk-like" removable media so that
each user could carry his files around with him.

A 1600 bpi 2400 foot 9-track holds about 40 Megabytes if you use long
blocks.  Other more recent magtapes (i.e. DLT's) hold 40-100 Gigabytes per
reel/cartridge.  Some specialized optical tape media hold Terabytes
per reel.

Absolutely.  There are ANSI standards for all of the above.  Despite
what others claim, interchangability was always rather straightforward,
and the worst problems are the "concepts" not supported by some operating
systems (i.e. Unix lacks file support for anything other than a file that's
just a stream-of-bytes).

Absolutely.  Part of my current profession is reading 9- (and 7-) tracks
that are up to 35 years old.

These uses aren't just historical - many of us still deal with datasets
that are Terabytes in size and which cannot be disk (or core) resident.

But in the 9-track world at least, 800 BPI was always NRZI, 1600 BPI
(and 3200 BPI) was always PE, and 6250 BPI was always a specific type
of GCR.  

In the 7-track world, recording was almost always NRZI.  One manufacturer
did make a 7-track PE system, but it was never a standard.

On a cow orker's 200 MHz Pentium Pro, Bob Supnik's emulator (compiled
with gcc and running under Linux) is about twice as fast as a real
11/73 for most CPU-intensive operations.  Speeds for I/O based
operations can range from incredibly faster to incredibly slower
than a real -11, of course, and a lot of the interrupt and device
priority schemes seem seriously out of whack with how a real PDP-11
works.  And speed also depends on whether the MMU
is enabled or not, too.

The same emulator running on a 7-year-old 133 MHz DEC Alpha is about
a third the speed of a real 11/73 (slow enough that a lot of 60 Hz
line-time-clock interrupts go uncounted under RT-11, for example!)

Yes, I didn't mean to imply you could have any mixture.  It's always irritated
me that I can't read 800bpi tapes on my 1600bpi drive simply because it doesn't
have the (optional) NRZI board.

	Ok - I finally got around to retrying Bob's emulator.  This is using
	gcc 2.8.1 under BSD/OS 3.1 with a PPro 200 and the Dhrystone 2.1 (C
	language version) program.

	Running under the emulator I get 555 dhrystones/second.  On a real
	11/73 I see 664 dhrystones/sec.

	I/O operations are faster but I suspect a some of that is
	due to Ultra-Wide Barracuda drives vs. HP 3724 and an Emulex UC08.

> than a real -11, of course, and a lot of the interrupt and device
> priority schemes seem seriously out of whack with how a real PDP-11

	The line frequency clock seems to be acting strange.    When running
	the dhrystone program I see:

Measured time too small to obtain meaningful results
Please increase number of runs

	EVEN THOUGH the (wall clock) run time for 20000 dhrystones was 36 
	seconds.

> The same emulator running on a 7-year-old 133 MHz DEC Alpha is about

	I recall when the DEC rep here brought in one of the first 150mhz
	Alpha systems.  Thought it was awesome that a machine could do a
	3 phase build of GCC in about 1 hour.  Ummm, today a PPro can do it
	in about 15 or 20 minutes ;)

	Other benchmarks of possible interest:

	A recompile of the 2.11BSD C compiler:

11/44	9min 20sec
11/73   9min 33sec
11/93   6min 43sec
emulated PDP-11 5min 25sec (BUT the 'time' reported with "time make" was 10min
			    4 sec)

	the 44 and 73 are suprisingly close because the 44 was hobbled with
	RA81s on a UDA50 while the 73 had a HP3724S on Emulex UC08.  Alas,
	the RA81 died so I no longer have a 44 to test with (until I get a RA9x
	or something myself since the support department refused to do it).

	Interesting that the emulated one is faster on this test even though
	the dhrystone rating is about 20% slower.

	Steven

Well, the obvious answer is DEC's (nowadays MENTEC's) own ANSI C
compiler, which runs under RSX and RSTS/e (not sure about RT-11
though...)

Yes, it does run under RT-11 (that's the only version I've used.)
But I've no idea of the lineage of that particular compiler - it wouldn't
surprise me to find out that it was derived from V6/V7 in some way.
(Though clearly with entirely new run-time libraries.)

As long as we're on the subject: has anyone succesfully cross-compiled
using 'gcc' on some non-11 platform to produce PDP-11 object code, which
they than succesfully ran?  While the compiler seems to work fine, I've
run into confusion when trying to use the *.h files from 2.11BSD to
do something useful.

I suspect that the emulator will be quite slow on any math-heavy
benchmark - and your observations confirm this.  Doesn't Bob's
emulator do the FP operations by converting everything to IEEE
and back for each and every operand?

On my cow-oreker's Pentium Pro, the line-time clock under Bob's emulator
appears to work fine, but it "misses" a lot of ticks when running on
my 7-year-old Alpha.  I've never looked at the logic to figure out exactly
what is going on, but I suspect that I couldn't emulate the interrupt/
priority structure any better than Bob's already done!

For most "real" PDP-11 emulation uses this is probably a more realistic
benchark than the Dhrystone.  I know lots of currently-being-used-and-
maintained PDP-11 applications, and none of them are heavy on FP - all
the FP-specific stuff got migrated to a faster machine the instant
the faster machine became available.  (You'd be amazed at the awful
machines that I've seen people use *just* because it did their integral
faster.  Farms of I860's and I960's were the rage a couple of years ago,
and boy was that an icky development platform.)

> (BUT the 'time' reported with "time make" was 10min

The line-time-clock on Bob's emulator doesn't necessarily have anything
to do with reality.  On my cow-orker's 200 MHz pentium Pro, it ticks
about twice as fast as real time, but on my Alpha it'll often not tick
at all if there's something else keeping the (emulated) CPU busy.  I
think other emulators (like John Wilson's) put more emphasis on real-time
applications and probably emulate the line-time-clock more faithfully.

Again, I think the C recompile is probably a better benchmark - unless
someone's specifically interested primarily in FP emulation, which I think
is likely to be the exception.

I don't know which directories you compiled, but here are the results

I don't want to clutter everyone's mailbox with a 32K file, so I've put it on

http://www.dunnington.u-net.com/public/dhrystone.c

and anyone who wants can grab it from there.  If there's any problem accessing
that page from that server, please do two things:
1) tell me! so I can complain, and
2) try http://www.personal.u-net.com/~dunnington/public/dhrystone.c
   or http://www.dunnington.u-net.com/ and follow the "no intel" link :-)

	Interesting!  So P11's time/clock handling is doing the right/expected
	thing.

	I'd give P11 a try but it's refusing to configure and build at the 
	moment.  Also the version (2.0) in the archive is about 4 years old 
	and only (from the looks of it) supports RL02 disks.  I've a nice 
	RP06 image built using Bob's emulator that I could "boot up"  if

Hmm.  That's a big difference in favour of Begemot.

It's not 100% accurate.  On my machine, it loses a few minutes a day.
But all the numbers add up, and it didn't lose noticably more time

I'll put some stuff together.  I've exchanged some mail on the
subjecte today with J�rg Micheel, one of the authors.  Hartmut Brandt,
the other, is in Germany and thus probably sleeping.  The version I
have him includes images for 2.11BSD, which I can't give to anybody,
though I suppose we can make an exception in your case :-)  I'll see
what I can put together.

There is indeed a bug in the floating point emulator: MODf was setting
the condition codes off the integer result, not the fractional result.

To fix the bug, look for this code fragment in source module pdp11_fp.c

case 3:							/* MODf */
	ReadFP (&fsrc, GeteaFP (dstspec, lenf), dstspec, lenf);
	F_LOAD (qdouble, FR[ac], fac);
	newV = modfp11 (&fac, &fsrc, &modfrac);
	F_STORE (qdouble, fac, FR[ac | 1]);
	F_STORE (qdouble, modfrac, FR[ac]);
==>	FPS = setfcc (FPS, fac.h, newV);
	break;

Change the indicated code line to be:

==>	FPS = setfcc (FPS, modfrac.h, newV);

and recompile.

Thanks to Warren Toomey for getting me the source to FACTOR, which
showed the bug.

(I can't believe this is the problem with vi, but who knows?  A bug in
MODf could affect the binary to decimal conversion routines in the run
time libraries.)

	The 'primes' program also uses 'modf' so it might encounter the same
	problem as FACTOR.

	'modf' is used in the runtime routines which compute 'long' (and
	unsigned long) remainders.  So if 'vi' is doing something like 
	"long % X" or "unsigned long % X" it's possible (likely) that it's 
	getting a wrong answer and becoming extremely confused.

	I'll check this later tonight.

Well, I agree.  I really shouldn't have been first.  Probably you,
Warren, should have been an "honorary" first, for all the effort you put
into it.

But, look at it this way.  Notice that the licenses are all "AU-#".  We
are all paying homage to "au" for bring this about.

I don't think the licensing section in San Francisco knows me from Adam.
I asked Dion if AU stood for Ancient Unix, Australia or both :-)

I'm so glad at least two people have got licenses (Charles Retter too).
It sets a legal precedent, in case SCO ever change their mind.

I wrote a little square root program in "C" to test the floating
point in Bob Supnik's emulator (see attached code).  The program
works fine under Linux, but bombs on Bob's emulator, confirming
people's theory that the emulator has a floating point bug. 

I used Newton's method for the algorithm and only uses add,
subtract, multiply and divide.  The emulator produced identical
incorrect results for two different versions of the program one using
floats, the other doubles.

Here's what the program does on Bob Supnik's emulator:

# cc mysqrt.c
# a.out

Curious about how heavily uv7 relies on floating point?

I was.  I wrote a little program to count the occurences of op code
'17' (the prefix for all PDP-11 floating point op codes) in Unix
executables.  It would seem from my results that Unix relies rather
heavily on floating point.  

Are my results in error?

I like that :-) and will pass it on to Dion. I think mine's in the mail
already, though. And of course I'm away for Easter, so it'll sit forlorn
in my mail box until Tuesday next week.

For those people interested in the PUP Archive, once their license arrives.
It is still changing (growing), as we get stuff. We plan to do a `freeze'
of material around the end of April, and cut a CD image then.

Anybody who wants a CD copy will get this CD image. The archive will diverge
from the CD of course, but I will be providing ftp access. We don't want to
create new images more than once or twice a year. You will need to pay the
volunteers to burn and mail you a CD.

Cheers,
	Warren

Is your tape just a raw format tape, or are you using the 32-bit
preamble/postambles to indicate the record/block sizes?

Read the tail-end of simh_doc.txt for details.

Anybody who gets a tape from me will get the latest version.  The same
will probably apply to CDs if I ever get round to installing a burner.

How did you recognize the instructions words?  Just because it's in
the text segment doesn't mean it's instructions.

All,
	I have the list of the first 12 SCO AU license holders in front of
me. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them :-( Anyway, things are humming along.

Charles, David, Doug, Ed, James, Jennine, John, Jorgen, Ken, Matthias,
Paul P, Paul V, Steven

Cheers,
	Warren

P.S Matthias has the most interesting number, AU-3B	 8-)
