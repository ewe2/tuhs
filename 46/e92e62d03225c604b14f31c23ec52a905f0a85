That was true at first, certainly the original binary was passed around.
It might have been an early net.noise  pass around, but ISTR for Tektronix
on V7 I got the binary from someone at UCB directly -- Mark Bales, maybe,
who was a UCB doing a summer Internship and he may have brought them with
him.

The sources were later released as part of a CSRG release in the post 4.2
timeframe ??reno/tahoe I think??, but by then the binary for the Vax was
pretty popular and the sources had begun to sneak out - as I know I had
them at Masscomp and Sun had them too.  Paul Cantrell (of video teco fame)
created a color version of it and IIRC may have added some other graphics
when running on a Masscomp tube.
