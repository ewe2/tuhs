hi there!

mine is about 40 inch high, 19 inch wide and
as deep as
the rl02 is. the "microcomputer interfaces
1983-84" shows
some pictures of boxes: is might be the
BA11-S

on the backplane i found H9276-A.
i don´t know what -A means, but it should be
a Q22/CD
so no serpentine?

now i´ve got the numbers here:
CPU:   M8190-AE      KDJ11-B
MEM:   M7551-CC      MSVC11-QC
RL02:  M8061
DELQA: M7516
RQDX3: M7555
DEQNA: M7546

hmmm, this is really confusing, since i have
AE
can it take an FPU? maybe it has a fpu? what
does
the fpu look like?

so i should put in first memory then cpu.

well it´s a BA11-S i suppose by now.
the panel and the pcb wich connects to the
two disks were literally "hanging"
when i got the box, it was a pdp-cabinet
and a second 19inch rack, containig old,
unused stuff and the tk50 and those 2 disks
there is a separate power supply for the
disks
now the tk50 and the disks are on a separate
table

it´s a original dec panel and dec pcb.

i suppose they changed CPU and memory from
the pdp11/23plus and put in half a 11/83.
the 3 switches at the frontbezel of the
BA11 work, the other "front"panel at the back
(from a 11/83) is only used to put the disks
online and write protect them. this would
also
explain why there is a connector "hanging"
at the rear-frontpanel.

a weird pdp.
