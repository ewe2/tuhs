Some thoughts...

1.) UCB Regents Position per AT&T/BSDi/UCB - anything through 32V is public
domain (see groklaw)
2.) All of Sun & IBM, bought out source licenses from AT&T with rights to
do anything.... IBM is based on the SVR3 license, Sun on SVR4
3.) IBM's license is the basis for the OSF/1 license
4.) HP independently eventually gets is own bought out license, but I'm not
sure what it's based [need to google the old UNIGRAM/X or the like]
5.) Sun takes SVR4 in and starts to add "Solaris features" to it (not going
to argue percentages here for the moment).
6.) Sun open sources this code base...

Now some questions....

From the above, one could argue that set of code included in Solaris from
the SysV linage was made public by step 6.

I have seen argument that anything through SVR3 is public because of the
actions of IBM, HP, and SUN when the code was bought out; but I have not
seen a definitive action like step 6 that infer all of SVR3 was public.
