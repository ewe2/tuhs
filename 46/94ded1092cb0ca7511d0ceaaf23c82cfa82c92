And for that reason, I have never used Python.  (I have a mental block
about that.)

As an 80-column aside, my alma mater allowed free runs in PL/C
(remember that?) on card decks.  I always numbered my cards in columns
73+ (and that save me from my clumsiness more than once).  One day,
they decided to read in all 80 columns.  Easily fixed by programming a
card-punch to add /* and */ but highly annoying.  But using cards
probably baked 80 columns into my head.
