Awesome, looks like my theory was completely wrong. Here's what it looks
like to me, please correct me as needed.

C's popularity has 2 distinct phases.

1972-1987 Unix drove C. Writing a functional PCC for a particular
architecture was easy, but not unusually so compared to other languages at
the time.

1987- gcc made C uniquely free to compile, so people chose to write C
because it was free and already popular.

Perl also came out in 1987, and afaik that was always free, but C still
took off because there was so much room for multiple languages.

So, now Im curious about embedded systems. In my limited experience, every
"embedded system" I programmed for from 2002-2011 had C as its primary
language. After 2011, I stopped programming embedded systems, so I don't
know after that. Why was C so dominant in this space? Is it because adding
a backend to gcc was free, C was already well known, and C was sufficiently
performant?
