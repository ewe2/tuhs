The Multics Pascal compiler has a "-french" option which maps all of the
keywords to French.

Some examples from "pascal_french_keywords.gi.info":

English             French
-------             ------
$export             $exporte
array               tableau
file                fichier
otherwise           autrement
unpack              detasser
