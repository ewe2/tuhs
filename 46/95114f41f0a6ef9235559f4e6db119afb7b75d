​Right - that follows what I had been told.   So /usr/local (for locally
compiled) and /usr/ucb (to differentiate from Research programs) were
introduced, which worked when UNIX was a source release.​

​Many makefiles in USENIX tapes use the /usr/local convention for new
programs but it failed to deal with binary distributions from ISV's ​

​Almost right --- This was one of the things the /usr/group gave us.   IIRC
it was Heinz Lyclamia that proposed it BTW.   Before IEEE P1003 (aka POSIX)
the burgeoning industry folks started to talk about how to deal with the
plethora of almost, but not quite the same UNIX flavors.   The 1985
/usr/group API was the result (which would begat POSIX but that's a
different story).

Heinz was the pushing an ABI not an API.   He was sure UNIX would never be
able to compete with VMS or the like and get ISV's to the table without
one.  Two of the things he insisted that we consider was where to install
vendors code and /usr/opt/vendor was born (** /opt would come later **)​.
It was put in /usr because symlink did not yet exist AND people agreed that
the root file system should be as small as possible.
