Subject: [Unix-jun72] init
Message-ID: <Pine.BSI.4.64.0805031915580.20114@malasada.lava.net>

I looked through init briefly and the version from s2.tar.gz is
slightly different than the one in the pdf printout.  In the printout
/dev/rk0 is mounted on /usr at boot time.  In the s2 version the
string "/usr" is still present, but the call to mount is gone
and so is the "/dev/rk0" string.

The init source is fairly short and shouldn't be too hard to type
in or get from ocr.  Has anyone yet worked through the details of
using the V7 compiler to make 0405 binaries?  Also has anyone
successfully used a populated /usr on rk0 yet?
