Subject: [TUHS] v6 lecture notes
Message-ID: <20170201103449.CF41916F4996@mac.korb>

Hi,
my site at the ba-stuttgart was removed. It hosted course ware for my
unix v6 lecture. This includes:
Unix Programmer's Manual (aka man pages)
Documents for use with the Unix Time-Sharing System
prepared as postscript files.
I provided the man pages as HTML-pages with the references replaced by
links.

The lecture notes contain tips for installing v6 on the simh emulator,
a description of the pdp11 instruction set and hardware as well as
a description of unix v6, including booting, kernel and user land software.

So if anyone is interested let me know.

Greetings
