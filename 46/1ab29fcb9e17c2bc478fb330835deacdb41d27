Subject: Moving a RL02..
Message-ID: <Pine.NEB.4.05.9812202150320.660-100000@spektr.ludvika.se>

Hi,
I was given a couple of QBus PDP11 on which I'm going to run 2.11BSD or
some other version of UNIX. One /73 and one /83. Both had RL02 drives, a
couple of RD53's and loads of serial boards and an extra expansion box
each. Now there's that little question of lugging them back to my
apartment. So, is there any particular precaution I should take when it
comes to the RL02's? Are they sensitive to vibrations or something? Do
they have to be in some sort of transport mode? 

Is there some information available online which explains how to operate
the RL02? Like how to open the drive, for starters... :) Or how the RL02
controller should be jumpered. (I guess that depends on what else is
present on the QBus though...)

Is there some other UNIX version that I can run on any of these machines?
I already have one PDP11/83 which happily runs 2.11BSD so it would be nice
to run older UNIX versions as well.

Thanks!

I could donate SunOS 3.2, SunOS 4.0 (MC68010), and the 4.0.3 upgrade to the
archive, assuming they want Sun2 material. I also have the SunOS 4.0.3 
_upgrade_ for the 68020. All the tape files are tarred and gziped on a CDROM
I burned not too long ago.

Well I'd sure love to see SunOS 1.x running on my 2/120. :-)

It would be 4-track QIC-11. SunOS 3.2 also came on four QIC-11 tapes. But
SunOS 4.x _probably_ only came on two QIC-24 tapes. (I say "probably" 
because my SunOS 4.x tapes are in 9-track QIC-11 format. I _assume_ this was 
done by somebody other than Sun so that it could be installed on a Sun2 with 
older ROMs.)

Dear PUPS List, 

I have connected a Fujisu M2444 9 track to an Emulex TC13 that is in my
11/84. The following is what happens when I try to boot a BSD 2.11 tape
that I made on my uVax3600/TU81+ (@6250 bpi):

	Enter device name and unit number then press the RETURN key: MS0

	Trying MS0	(tape starts rolling)

	Starting ROM boot  

	140276		(tape stops)
	@

The boot programs that are available are quite extensive on this 11/84, it
does tapes, disks, just about everything.  The M2444 is checked out by
doing the test (01 start, etc)and passes all the tests.  If I reverse the
cables on the M2444 the LED on the TC13 comes on and the M2444 will not do
anything.
