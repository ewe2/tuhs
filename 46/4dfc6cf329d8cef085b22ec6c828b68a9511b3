As far as I know that was never true.  We used used POSIX as a
reference mainly because it was more easily available as a
specification.  So that meant that we implemented termios support, and
not termio, or the BSD variant.  The networking layer was all BSD
sockets; we certainly never implemented STREAMS, for goodness sake!  :-)
