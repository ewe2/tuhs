I certainly don't want the kernel making that decision for me; I might 
want to abandon the entire read() if I was signalled.  I did write some 
code that did that, but I've long since forgotten the details.

Agreed; the kernel should make as few decisions as possible, and I've used 
variations on that wrapper, depending on the signal etc.

Almost invariably serial lines, and I used to do a lot of that code.
