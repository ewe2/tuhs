One of the things we liked about Datakit was that the computer didn't have
to establish the connection before it could reject the call, unlike TCP/IP
where all validation happens after the connection is made. This is also why
sockets and Datakit never worked together; sockets pretty much assume
Ethernet-like connection rules.

I am not a networking expert, but to me in this regard at least Datakit
seemed like a prettier picture. I suppose you can DOS-attack the network,
but not the machines. Datakit had other issues, for sure, like the
expensive racks of hardware, but then that's because, for better and worse,
it was designed by phone engineers rather than.... however you'd
characterize Ethernet and its original "I scream while listening to your
whisper", 5V into 50=E2=84=A6 Schmidt-triggered craziness. Ethernet's come =
a long
way, but the engineering of the original Radio Shack parts was not favored
by the Bell Labs crowd.
