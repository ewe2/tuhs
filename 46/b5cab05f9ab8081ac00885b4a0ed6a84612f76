I was going to ask the same question.

Funny, I still often (tend) to use line numbers to do multi-line operations
not marks - probably because SOS was one of the first editors I learned and
first I learned to use really well.

Now here is where my memory is hazy.  I do remember using SOS on the
PDP-10s which had mostly glass TTYs, but for some reason I have memories of
using it on an ASR-33 on the TSS/360 - which must be wrong.    I thinking,
there probably had to have been an IBM editor similar to it that I'm
confusing with the TOPS/TENEX.  I also have no memories of what editor we
used on the original VMS V1.0 machine -- it must have been a member of the
TECO family, although again I want to say we had something like SOS.

I do remember that learning ed(1) on UNIX was a piece of cake and
immediately loved regex for patterns.  I was still doing some PDP-10
hacking for the CS-Dept in those days, and bitching that I wanted ed(1) on
the 10s after I mastered it.
