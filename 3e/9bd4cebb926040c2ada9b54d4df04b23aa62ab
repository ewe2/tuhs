Similar fun Unix/ITS emacs story.

In the mid/later 1970s, my least techie sister Cynthia was/is a concert
harpist with a degree from Oberlin's conservatory.  She can type extremely
fast as she has super manual dexterity.  But playing the harp is not
something that paid a great deal or offered her 'regular' gigs, so to make
the monthly rent she got a job working at MIT as Ron Rivest's admin .  She
typed all the RSA papers in emacs and tex on one of the MIT systems.  She
did not know any better, that's what they gave her/taught her.   When she
later would look for a job at other places and they would ask her, 'do you
know how to use a Wang System' and she would say: "No, I know emacs" [for
the younger set, longer before MS-Word, "Wang" was synonymous with "word
processor" and many/most commercial offices had a 'Wang unit" for the folks
doing the typing.].

 [As a side note when she found out the elevators were hacked and
controlled by the student's different computers, she stopped using them and
would take the stairs in Tech Sq].
