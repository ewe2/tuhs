Thanks Paul, I vaguely remember being told about this effort by my 
mentor which is what sparked my interest.  At the time we were trying to 
optimally use all available CPU resources for rendering and while we did 
have working solutions it required lots of perl and shell.  so the idea 
of CPU resources being available and shared as a foundational concept on 
the network was really interesting to me.

I also seem to remember him telling me about working on the patriot 
missile system, although i am not certain if i am remembering correctly 
that this was something he did at apollo or at another company in the 
boston area.
