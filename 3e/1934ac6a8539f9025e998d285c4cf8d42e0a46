IIRC, the main issue from back in the day was different densities on the
same form-factor tapes. So if you want to the same model 8mm drive, it
works, if you go to a different (older?) model, it wouldn't. Eg, going from
the 8500 -> 8200 caused problems due to data density issues. IIRC, you
could write low density data tapes on the 8500 for interchange with the
8200, but it wasn't the default on some platforms?

But it's been a long time and my memory is hazy... so long that Exabyte
went bankrupt, several new tenants tried to rent the old space, the
developer that bought it at the exabyte firesale wen bankrupt too and the
new developers that bought it have torn down the old Exabyte offices in
Boulder and replaced it with a set of luxury apartments... I could be
misremembering...
