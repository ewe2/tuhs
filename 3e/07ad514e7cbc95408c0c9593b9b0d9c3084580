About two queries on the topic.

Yes, L. L. Cherry is Lorinda Lillian Cherry.

Rudd Canaday was in on building the foundation, but not the
ground floor. When the Thompson/Ritchie/Canaday (and independently
Strachey/Stoy) file system came to be built, Rudd had completed
his visiting assignment in Computing Science Research. When he
did get a login, he was rhc, but his UID was not among the
single-digit set.
