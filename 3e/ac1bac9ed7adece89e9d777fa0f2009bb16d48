Hello (again) from Gregg C Levine
I agree. You will note I didn't say where the medium sized box would
use those parts, just that they did. However, according to three
authors, also AMD engineers at the time of their writings, wrote this
book, "Bit-Slice Microprocessor Design", and the authors were, John
Mich, and Jim Brick. The application notes, that they compiled into
it, suggest that something along the lines of the LSI-11 could evolve
from their work. And indeed a different pairing did just that. 

The book's name, and the author's names were, " The art of digital
design : an introduction to top-down design / David Winkel, Franklin
Prosser". In that book they, completely cloned a PDP-11 system, or
something that could run such software, as we would run on the
families of simulators, and emulators. 
      
So we are both right from a certain point of view. 

And you've got a better idea of what I am up to.
