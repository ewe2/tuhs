XENIX was initially targeted for the PDP-11, for some reason beyond my
understanding.  Looking at the Wikipedia page, it seems that the first
Intel ports were not aimed at the PC-AT.

You don't say where this quote comes from.  The use of pluperfect
suggests that it's not from the Unix/World article.  The PC was
announced in August 1981, and the PC-AT was released in August 1984,
so the date of the article fits well.
