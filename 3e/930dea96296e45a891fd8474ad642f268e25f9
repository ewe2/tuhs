Actually, I like playing with emulators - they use a LOT less power than 
real computers :)

HP-UX comes with a REAL K&R c compiler that wont handle ANY ANSI stuff.  
It's used to rebuild the kernel, but you can use it to build K&R C 
programs too.  That should be usable for the kernel C routines and 
utilities.  But as you pointed out, the assembly stuff you have to be 
rewritten.  Also, you'd have to deal with disk and tty drivers.
