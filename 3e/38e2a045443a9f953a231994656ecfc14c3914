â€‹Not a  lawyer... but for patents, I am under the impression that the date
is defined as "first public discloser."  So I think the official date would
be the UNIX talk given in *"paper presented at the Fourth ACM Symposium on
Operating Systems Principles, IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center,
Yorktown Heights, New York, October 15-17, 1973."   [*

I believe that said paper predates all of the books.   Fact is before Bach,
UNIX shows up in a number of OS texts, so the point is that the IP is being
taught by Universities and studies by students.   Which is of course what
the judge points out when the case was decided.

And clearly, the legal battle was stupid.  But pride is an amazing thing
and corporate pride seems the worst in my experience.

all quite sad.
