Well, I can share a bit of the piece of the elephant(s) I saw.=0A=0AWhil=
e most of the Unix folks were PDP-11 only (after MULTICS), I had=0Aspent=
 a couple of years helping to run the MH comp center.=C2=A0=C2=A0 The=0A=
system for the IBM 7094 was among the best anywhere -- card decks were=
=0Astaged to tape and the overhead of changing from one job to the next=
=0Awas minimized.=C2=A0 Most modest-sized job submissions were finished=
 in=0Aroughly an hour.=C2=A0=C2=A0 When MULTICS started, the 7094 went a=
way and it=0Awas a huge jolt.=C2=A0 There were some amazing programs (e.=
g., a LISP=0Acompiler written in MACRO FAP that would go 250 levels deep=
 to produce=0Agood code).=C2=A0 There were acoustic simulation programs=
 that were way=0Aahead of their time.=C2=A0 And they were all lost.=0A=
=0AWith MULTICS still way in the future and no more 7094, a software=0Ap=
ackage was put together to allow the MULTICS machines to run the=0Acomme=

 I=0Adiscovered it, and started to use it to write some system admin=0Ap=

Dennis for some changes.=C2=A0 He listened politely, and then said "Why=
=0Adon't you fix it.=C2=A0 The compiler is just a program, after all..."=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=0ASo I put some things into B, including support for the GE=
 native 6-bit=0Acharacter set.=C2=A0 This eventually found its way into=
 C and CPP.=C2=A0=0ADecades later, if you wrote `abc` in the DEC C compi=

 ADA and PASCAL, and to base the code generation on the=0APCC2 model to=
 gain portability.=C2=A0 Although AT&T's computer business=0Awas pretty=
 much a disaster, I felt that I had met these goals=C2=A0 -- Elf=0Aand D=

 my watch.=C2=A0 I also had a lot of fun working with a bright=0Aand div=

 I=0Aunderstand it, the genesis for their system was a kernel from MH th=

=0Abunch of other utilities that Summit had collected/developed, but=0Aw=

 RJE and SCCS was needed for the IBM support and=0Awhile Ted (and his un=

 =C2=A0Tar did not yet exist. TS had some of the PWB tools like volcpy;=
=0Abut we were using DOS-=0A11's similar but different backup =0Ascheme=
 (I've forgotten the name of the format; but the tapes were=0Aboot-able,=
 which=C2=A0volcpy=C2=A0tapes were not).=0A=0AFWIW:=C2=A0 cu(1) did not=

=A0 We used it to download images to the Microprocessors=0Alike the KIM-=
1.=C2=A0 =C2=A0It was originally written with the v6 portable C=0Alibrar=
y, which is also what the original fsck used (it's what we had=0Aon v6).=
=C2=A0 =C2=A0Ted introduced me to what would become stdio and one of my=
=0Afirst tasks was using it with connect(1cmu).=C2=A0 The other thing I=
=0Aremember about that program is it was the first time I wrote somethin=
g=0Athat used two separate processes on a UNIX system that cooperated wi=
th=0Aeach=C2=A0other and found it so much easier than on the PDP-10.=0A=
=0AAlso, Dennis' stand-alone system for V7 was not yet available BTW.=C2=
=A0=0A=C2=A0If I think of anything else about that system I can remember=
, I'll=0Asend an update=0A=0APWB 2.0 was released just after V7, also "b=
ased on it".=0A=0AI think the confusion is that TS and V7 were done sort=
 of at the same=0Atime and while the folks working on them talked to eac=
h other,=C2=A0it has=0Anever been clear to me who was behind TS. For ins=
tance, I would learn=0Athat Bourne was the 'project leader' for Seventh,=
 in that he was the=0Aperson that collected everything for it.=C2=A0 I n=
ever heard of someone=0Ahaving the same role for TS, which is why I some=
times think it was a=0Aname inside of Summit, but never actually saw the=
 light of day as a=0Aformal release.=C2=A0 =C2=A0I really am not sure an=
d would love to learn more=0Adetails (I wish Ted were still alive to fil=
l us in).=0A=0AAs for V7 itself, Ken wrote tar(1)=0A in response to cpio=
 (preferring an ASCII based header, but=0A'threading' it like cpio did,=
 but keeping the user interface that=0Atp/stp had).=C2=A0 As I understan=

 Lo=0A=0Ats of new peripheral support, which is why he also added lseek(=
) as=0Adisks overflowed a 16-bit integer for the seek position=0A.=C2=A0=
 Plus there were a number of other small changes between v6 and=0Av7.=C2=
=A0 Some of this stuff from PWB and Summit went back to MH (fsck as=0Aan=
 example), but not everything (like cpio/volcpy/SCCS).=C2=A0 I kind of=
=0Athink of the kernel and Typesetter C going from MH to Summit and the=
=0APWB teams.=0A=0A@Steve Johnson, I need your help here.... at some poi=

aw.</div><div><br></div><div>While most of the Unix folks were PDP-11 on=
ly (after MULTICS), I had spent a couple of years helping to run the MH=
 comp center.=C2=A0=C2=A0 The system for the IBM 7094 was among the best=
 anywhere -- card decks were staged to tape and the overhead of changing=
 from one job to the next was minimized.=C2=A0 Most modest-sized job sub=
missions were finished in roughly an hour.=C2=A0=C2=A0 When MULTICS star=
ted, the 7094 went away and it was a huge jolt.=C2=A0 There were some am=
azing programs (e.g., a LISP compiler written in MACRO FAP that would go=
 250 levels deep to produce good code).=C2=A0 There were acoustic simula=
tion programs that were way ahead of their time.=C2=A0 And they were all=
 lost.<br></div><div><br></div><div>With MULTICS still way in the future=
 and no more 7094, a software package was put together to allow the MULT=
ICS machines to run the commercial GCOS system (the software was called=
 the K package, K standing for kluge.=C2=A0 It was well named...)=C2=A0=
=C2=A0 Anyhow, they needed help, and asked me to help, and I did so for=
 a couple of years, largely supporting FORTRAN.=C2=A0=C2=A0 Meanwhile, D=
ennis was inventing B, and there was a limping version for the GE.=C2=A0=
 He may have actually used it as part of a bootstrap of the language --=
 I'm not sure.=C2=A0 So I discovered it, and started to use it to write=
 some system admin programs.=C2=A0 I soon ran into some limitations, and=
 started to lobby Dennis for some changes.=C2=A0 He listened politely, a=
nd then said "Why don't you fix it.=C2=A0 The compiler is just a program=
, after all..."=C2=A0=C2=A0 So I put some things into B, including suppo=
rt for the GE native 6-bit character set.=C2=A0 This eventually found it=
s way into C and CPP.=C2=A0 Decades later, if you wrote `abc` in the DEC=
 C compiler, it produced GE strings...=C2=A0=C2=A0 I also made it possib=
le to call FORTRAN from C (the other way was a bit harder...).</div><div=
><br></div><div>Eventually they set up an organization to formally own r=
unning the comp center, and I was invited to return to Research and I di=
d.=C2=A0=C2=A0 But I had gained a lot of sensitivity to the needs of Eng=
ineers and Scientists just wanting to get their work done. <br></div><di=
v><br></div><div>Years later, when I was asked to come over to Summit an=
d head the System V language department, V7 was behind us, and the Inter=
data port had taught us a lot about portability.=C2=A0 PCC had proved it=
self on a half dozen machines and had been well received.=C2=A0 But most=
 of the Bell System was using 16-bit DEC machines and Dennis' compiler.=
=C2=A0 C++ was under develpment and looked like a clear winner, but it n=
eeded a lot of work.=C2=A0 The debugging of C++ was horrible -- a progra=
m, Cfront, converted C++ to C, but in the process screwed up the line nu=
mbers and names so that using a debugger was almost impossible. =C2=A0 M=
y three goals in going to Summit were to make C++ commercially available=
, to provide a debugging technology that could handle not just C++ and C=
 but FORTRAN and ADA and PASCAL, and to base the code generation on the=
 PCC2 model to gain portability.=C2=A0 Although AT&amp;T's computer busi=
ness was pretty much a disaster, I felt that I had met these goals=C2=A0=
 -- Elf and Dwarf, C++ debugging, and the first commercial C++ product h=
appened on my watch.=C2=A0 I also had a lot of fun working with a bright=
 and diverse group of talented people.</div><div><br></div><div>Sadly, a=
s the AT&amp;T computer business collapsed, I realized that I loved doin=
