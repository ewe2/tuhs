The first two were fixed; the prototype was

  Xv_object xv_create (Xv_opaque owner, Xv_pkg *pkg, ...);

The keywords (XV_WIDTH etc) contained a bitfield encoding the type and
cardinality of the value argument(s) so that the argument list could
be traversed without knowing every package's keywords.

Using NULL as the terminating argument looks unportable.
