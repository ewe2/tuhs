You haven't lived until you've dealt with a 1's-complement machine i.e. -0 
!= 0 ...  To be fair, it was *mostly* normalised.

Ever tried a Univac or a Honeywell?  I don't remember the exact details, 
and I prefer to keep it that way...

I had to support an old Alpha once; that was one of the reasons why I was 
happy to leave the joint.  We had just one customer who used an Alpha, and 
thus we/I had to maintain the thing.

And don't even ask me about HP-UX (just as well that they weren't called 
Packard-Hewlett), nor Xenix, nor early Slowaris, nor National Cash 
Registers, nor...

Excuse me, I now have to take my sleepy pills :-)
