This sounds similar to some work with which I'm involved at the
University of Washington.  I'll see what I can learn....  -- Ian

As I am reading the details of this, it seems that they are at a
planning 
stage,
and wanting to coordinate the Library of Congress centrally with other
federal and non-federal agencies and organizations to develop the
"network" of libraries and repositories for these materials.  It was not
clear what funding was available to non-federal agencies.  My
expectation is that the PUPS and TUHS efforts ought to be somewhere in
the overall thicket of the Library of Congress effort.  We need to find
out more about this legislation and potential work and funding.  It
sounds very interesting...

Spinning the ol' propeller-headed beanie at full speed, and thinking out

loud....
