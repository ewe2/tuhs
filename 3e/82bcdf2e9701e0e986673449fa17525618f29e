I also had something like that in mind, except being British/Australian 
I'd spell it with an "s" :-)

Which is why I suggested there be a means to turn it off; I'm becoming a 
fan of environment variables to modify the standard behaviour of tools 
(but I loathe the Penguin/OS default to use colours).

More than likely; as I approach age 68 I notice that I'm losing some 
cognitive facility...  I might start using "," and see if I like it, but I 
see that the Mac doesn't have it (my Penguin is off the air at the 
moment), and having it as an environment variable would be nice.

Agreed; as for the bug I think it comes down to what is meant by an
unprintable character.  I certainly remember finding "hidden" set-uid
shells with the name of ".. " etc back when I was going after the
UNSW kiddies with an axe back in the late 70s...
