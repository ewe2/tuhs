I have not so far come across an NCP Unix that was not based on the UoI =
code base.

At a time there was a =E2=80=9CRand Unix=E2=80=9D, that combined the UoI =
code with a few other
extensions. A 1978 document describes the kernel as:

"UNIX version 6 with modifications some of which are:
- Accounting
- A system call to write end of files on pipes
- A system call which checks whether a process would sleep upon doing a =
read on either a pipe or tty
- Pseudo teletypes
- The network control program NCP written at the University of Illinois
- A new method of interprocess communication called ports. Ports are =
similar to pipes but have names and can be accessed by any process.=E2=80=9D=


The system call to write EOF on pipes is eofp() and the blocking read =
test is empty(). Both are available in the NCP Unix source code as =
included on the TUHS Unix Tree page. It could well be that the hack =
Lawrence refers to above was a modification to empty() to also cover his =
bisync driver.

I guess empty() is the first step on the path that includes =
capac()/await() and later select()/poll() as the preferred mechanism to =
prevent blocking on IPC files (incl. tty=E2=80=99s).
