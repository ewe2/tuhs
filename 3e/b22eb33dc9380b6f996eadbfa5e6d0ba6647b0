Or perhaps it was added precisely to get rid of the window, and then someone
discovered that it could be used to freeze the system, so they decided they'd
better not document it?

If the system had MOS memory, and you had to power cycle the machine to get it
out of this state, there wouldn't be any evidence left of who did the deed
(unless the system was writing extensive audit trailing to disk), so it would
be a great 'system assasin' (aka vandal) tool.

PS: I guess this is more PDP-11ish than UNIXish - apologies for the off-topic!
