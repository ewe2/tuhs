Subject: [TUHS] Early TCP/IP: 3Com UNet
Message-ID: <54216FB6-4D50-46F5-9DCC-03E90BB59B69@planet.nl>


Just stumbled over another early TCP/IP for Unix:
http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/3Com/3Com_UNET_Nov80.pdf

It would seem to be a design similar to that of Holmgren's (NCP-based) Network Unix (basic packet processing in the kernel, connection management in a user space daemon). In time and in concept it would sit in between the Wingfield ('79, all user space) and the Gurwitz ('81, all kernel) implementations.

I think it was distributed initially as a mod versus V7 and later as a mod versus 2BSD.

Would anybody here know of surviving source of this implementation?

Thanks,

Paul
