Subject: [pups] missing V6 Docs
Message-ID: <200105012219.f41MJKa23332@RVC1.Informatik.BA-Stuttgart.DE>

Hi,

In "SETTING UP UNIX - Sixth Edition" some documents are mentioned
that are not in the V6 distribution (v6doc in from Dennis or the
corresponding part of the tape from Ken Wellsch). These are:
(numbers from the cover page)

	10. NROFF Users' Manual
	12. A Manual for the Tmg compiler-writing Language
	14. The M6 Macro Processor
	15. A System for Typewriting Mathematics
	16. DC - An interactive desk calculator

Does anyone know, why these docs were not included in the distribution
if they are somewhere on minnies disks? I am only searching for the V6 docs,
not V7, where these files were distributed. Just curious.

Wolfgang

I recall stumbling across them in an odd place in Ken Wellsch's
distribution.  I'll try to remember to look when I get home (it's on my
PDP-11) and send another mail -- Ian
