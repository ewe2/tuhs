Warren,

Thanks for your help.  To my amazement in one day I received
8 requests for the documents you posted on the TUHS mailing
list for me.  If you think it's appropriate you can post that
everything has been claimed.  I will be mailing the Unix TMs
and other papers to Robert Swierczek <rmswierczek at gmail.com>
who said he will scan any one-of-a-kind items and make them
available to you and TUHS.  The manuals/books will be going
to someone else who very much wanted them.

Mel
