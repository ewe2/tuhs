Subject: [TUHS] BSD family tree with Quasijarus in it

I found this while playing with AmphetaDesk for the very first time.

Offhand I think the very top of the graphic is terribly misleading.  It
insinuates that UNIX is derived from Multics.  It would be just as true to say
it was derived from Project Genie or to say that Linux is derived from UNIX. 
They are independant systems with similarities, nothing more.
