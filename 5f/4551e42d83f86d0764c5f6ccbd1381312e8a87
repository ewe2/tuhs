The 11/70 service manual is all good, but it's definitely not enough.
Ideally, you should have access to the full drawings, the service manual 
for the CPU, the service manual for the memory subsystem, I seem to 
remember that the FP11 has its own service manual, and I think the 
massbus interface also has its own documentation set.
Also, the memory system consists of both the Unibus map, the cache and 
memory bus system, and they you have separate documentation for the 
memory boxes (either MJ11 or MK11 box).

I don't know how much documentation have been scanned, and I haven't 
really checked. Since I still have access to all the documentation on 
paper I usually use that.

I don't even remember all the manuals and drawings that exist.
