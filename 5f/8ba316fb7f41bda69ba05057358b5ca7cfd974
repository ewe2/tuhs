Hi,
Does anyone of You know of any public mainframe/as400 offering public 
service with 3270 interface, I mean which can be contacted via x3270 
running in Unix X.
locis.loc.gov, serving in Library of Congress for 2 or 3 decades, seems 
to be gone, but perhaps there are still some survived in USA .

Andrzej
