(Yes, a repeat, but this momentous event only happens every few years.)

The International Earth Rotation Service has announced that there will be 
a Leap Second inserted at 23:59:59 UTC on the 31st December, due to the 
earth slowly slowing down.  It's fun to listen to see how the time beeps 
handle it; will your GPS clock display 23:59:60, or will it go nuts 
(because the programmer was an idiot)?

I actually have a recording of the last one, over at 
www.horsfall.org/leapsecond.webm (yes, I am a tragic geek),
