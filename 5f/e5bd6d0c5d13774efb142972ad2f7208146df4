QNX is awesome.

I was friends with Dan Hildebrandt, he was one of the 3 people who were
allowed to touch the microkernel code.  That kernel could fit easily in
a 4K instruction cache and leave room for other processes.  They measured
everything in cache misses, every commit had them thinking about cache
misses.

I'm definitely a unikernel guy but I had mad respect for QNX, Dan and
I would talk often about stuff, like how would this work in your world
and how would it work in my world.  The QNX core team was amazing.

Sadly, we lost Dan to brain cancer (I think) in 1998.
