Yep, great guy.  We could argue long and hard but it was always about
the tech, never about the person.  An engineer's engineer.

Um, I've been reading about Mill for at least a decade.  It's not 
real until it ships.  It's still vaporware, no?

That's been the claim but there is no data to support that claim.  In fact
the opposite.  History has shown that microkernels can work if you are 
super super careful.  Monolithic kernels work in spite of all the idiots
checking in stupid stuff.

I *love* the idea of a microkernel with a bunch of processes implementing
the OS, it's so much a better design.  I also have been in the real world
long enough to think that I'm not going to see Linux replaced with a 
microkernel in my lifetime.  I wish, but I don't see it happening.
