That is helpful info. I sure hope the source survived in your basement.

Bob Metcalfe is indeed a professor at UT now and Bruce Borden is at gThrive. I will reach out to both and ask for their support in getting the code released. If the company founders support the release of 40 year old code with no current commercial value, we might have a good case with 3Com's general counsel.

I was not aware of a link between Bruce Borden and Rand Ports. The Rand reports about this were written by Sunshine and Zucker, and I had assumed Zucker was the implementor of the code.

Steve Glaser wrote a HyperChannel driver for it, which is a pretty amazing piece of work.  BTW:  Somewhere, I have the mailing envelope that is dated the "32 of December, 1980" because they had an end of the year clause with their VC's and ran into a problem right before they shipped it too me.  I thought that was pretty cool, so I kept it.

The original tape would have been at Tek but I did have somethings in my archives from those days, i.e. my home directory which in couple of cases has compressed tar or cpio images of interesting things.   For instance it was discovered a few years back that I last known copy of UCDS - which Dennis was able to get released as a very late delivery of part of V7 and Warren now has in his archives.

It's there copy-written IP.

Borden might be able to help as the original author, but he has not worked for 3Com for eons, plus I have not talked to him a few years, although I may know how to find him.   Bob Metcalfe might also be able to help, but other than being a stock holder, I'm not sure what influence he has with 3Com management.  Similarly, I have not spoken to Bob is while either, in fact the last time I did he was still a Principal at Polaris and one our Board of Directors at Ammasso -- I think he's now @ UT Austin.

In time and in concept it would sit in between the Wingfield ('79, all user space) and the Gurwitz ('81, all kernel) implementations.
