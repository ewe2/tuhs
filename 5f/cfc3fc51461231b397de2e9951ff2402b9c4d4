Did you write bos.s and msys.s from scratch?   I noticed your
wunix contains no header, just the binary bits.  Was this standard
procedure in other versions of unix or is it possible that
the msys program took in an 0405 or 0407 and stripped the header
off before writing it?  Is there an easy way to strip the header
from within the unix system with standard commands?
