I'm not sure how people keep missing the original point.  Which was:
the market won't choose a bunch of wimpy cpus when it can get faster
ones.  It wasn't about the physics (which I'm not arguing with), it 
was about a choice between lots of wimpy cpus and a smaller number of
fast cpus.  The market wants the latter, as Ted said, Sun bet heavily
on the former and is no more.

If you want to bet on what Sun did, feel free, but do so knowing that
people have tried to tell you that is a failed approach.
