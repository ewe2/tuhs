	Wow, that is quite old.

	A faster link is at FTP.TO.GD-ES.COM (that's a T-1 vs the ISDL 
	link I have at home).

	It _might_ be easier to create an install tape from the files in
	the 2.11 portion of the PUPS archive - I think that was updated
	to about patchlevel 432 or so.   There is documentation on how to
	create a boot tape, etc from the compressed files.

	On the other hand it might be instructive/interesting/whatever to
	apply the 42 updates manually - just be sure to read the instructions
	that come with each one :)

	Cheers,

	Steven
