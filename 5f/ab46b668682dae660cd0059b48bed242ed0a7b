It hasn't really started yet. The person who found the tapes is
moving a little slowly, still trying to choose someone to do the
work.

When there's something to report, I will do so.

I did find Scott Lee's program to dump Pr1me MAGSAV format tapes
onto a Unix system. It's now available at

	https://github.com/arnoldrobbins/pdump

if anyone wants it.
