Hmm.  Well, the V7 tape is saved... took a bunch of retries, but
I managed to grab all of it.

The V6 (Mini-UNIX) tape was OK, but some !$%(!@#$%@# must have run
out of blank tapes, and decided to use this one.. it contains binary
data.  Major bummer, sorry :(

Still working on the 2.8BSD tape, which needs more work.  I also
have to work on Christian Corti's tapes.. now that I have a working
800bpi SCSI drive, I actually *can* :)  [thanks Walter!]

Images will be sent off to the PUPS archive.

Cheers,
	Fred
