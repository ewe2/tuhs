I for one would be VERY interested. It would be an interesting exercise 
to try it out on a SIMH emulator.

9 bits would work - and still, waste 4 bits of the 36-bit word ... any 
code carried over from elsewhere would never use the 9th bit unless you 
know of stuff that does?

And yup, I remember KLH, not personally, but as the KLH-10 author :)
