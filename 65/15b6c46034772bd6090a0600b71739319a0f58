There's more BSD in the Mac OS X kernel than you might think, at least
judging from the stream of patches that come back into FreeBSD.  They
use BSD networking, and FreeBSD's 802.11 stack, for example.  Some of
the file system code is also from BSD.  Darwin is a classic example of
what one can do when one doesn't care where one gets one's code from.
This has both pluses and minuses...
