There's definitely Rob Pike's talk "UNIX Style, or cat -v Considered 
Harmful", which he delivered at the 1983 Usenix Association Conference 
and Software Tools USers Group Summer Conference.  Unfortunately, I 
can't find it online.  It's interesting that the talk's date is now 
closer to the birth of Unix than to the present.
