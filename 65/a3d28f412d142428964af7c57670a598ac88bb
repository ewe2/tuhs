You do you, I had undiagnosed ADD so partys in college were just an 
awkward cringe fest for me.  Looking backwards, now that I've figured
that out, yeah, I can see it, sort of, if I knew then what I know now.

I was pretty committed to learning in college.  I'm not trying to judge
or anything, it was just such a fun focussed time for me, I'd happily
give up a party (where I was gonna get nothing) for a few hours on slovax
where the BSD source was.

Details aside, I think we both self identify as engineers and love it.
