The move into RAM disks happened as memories grew. This obviated the need
to copy a filesystem to a new disk's swap space and then use that to really
install the system.

Kernels with bundled RAM disks were a thing in BSD for a long time, though
I'm unsure when that functionality entered the code stream. I know the
early versions of FreeBSD's installer ran out of a RAM disk loaded off
floppies, though that's not the same as initrd since there never was a
pivot to something else: just a reboot to boot the real thing.

FreeBSD, at least, has the functionality to also do a RAM disk to get
things configured enough to pivot to the real disk on boot, but that's a
niche operation there: most everybody just boots off / directly without the
initrd-like thing. It's rarely needed, but it's one of those things that
when it is needed, it's really needed, which is why one can do it.

FreeBSD has an interesting 'tertiary loader' that plays a similar role to
initrd. It orchestrates loading of modules, setting tunable parameters and
launching the kernel. It's grown up to be a mini-kernel stand-alone
program, but as the real kernel is now 28MB, the boot loader leverages off
'boot services' or other well-known interfaces to weigh in at only a few
hundred k. This has proven to be both a blessing and a curse at times,
however.
