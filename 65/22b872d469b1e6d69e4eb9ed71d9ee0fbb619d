Arnold -- good memory.

It was in 4BSD (see disk1 of the McKusick disks) but it is not in 3BSD.  I
agree with you, it was not in V7  or 32v (but was in later BSD 2.9/10/11
releases). Frankly, I have memories of Ratfor in V7 on the PDP-11 [and used
as part of my thesis on the Vax].   IIRC to use ratfor on the 11, you
needed the V7addenda that had a bunch of F77 fixes.

I have memories of EFL and reading the doc.  But I have no memories of ever
using it - although Hilfinger may have talked about it in the UCB
grad comparative languages seminar maybe in 81/82 timeframe (my memory is
hazy - I know it was there that Paul was the one that taught me to not
hate Ada so much and understand why Ada was like it was).  What I can not
place is where I first saw EFL.  My WAG would be UCB.

FWIW:   Stu did a sabbatical at UCB when I was a grad student.   I'm going
to guess maybe he brought it with him during that time.
