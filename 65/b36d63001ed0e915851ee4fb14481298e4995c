They are certainly worth something.  (And, being finite, will probably
be worth more in the future.)  If they mean something to you personally,
you should probably hold on to them.  If you want to sell them, I would
recommend eBay (which seems to be the best venue for selling used computer
manuals at the moment).  Be sure to include a write-up of what makes these
two volumes so special.  

Note that BSTJ vol. 57, no. 6 will likely fetch a much higher price than 
vol. 63, no. 8.  (I've bought the latter for as little as ten bucks.)

(Does anyone know how many copies of BSTJ vol. 57, no. 6 there are out there?)
