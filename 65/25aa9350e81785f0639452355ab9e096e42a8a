Noel,

Yikes! I admit to reacting to the content of Deborah's email comments 
about how things used to be and on a general level without doing my due 
diligence and checking into the specific conversation that sparked the 
appeal. If the conversation she was referring to was your ARPAnet 
clarification, and I fear it was, then was I ever out of line for 
commenting about civility, and I'd like to set the record straight here. 
I have since done my due diligence and read through the ARPAnet thread, 
and your comments were direct, for sure, but not at all inappropriate 
given the personal experience you have with this particular group and 
the circumstances of the events in question. It would seem that my 
sentiments while well-meaning ,and generally sound,Â  were mistakenly 
motivated by what appears to have been a skewed understanding, and you 
have my apologies for the unintended implications of my civility and 
netiquette comments. I apologize.

Regards,

Will
