We gained Niklaus Wirth, otherwise known as Mr ALGOL (and thereby freeing 
us from the chains of FORTRAN), back in 1934; you can either call him by 
name, or call him by value (non-programmers are not expected to understand 
this computer joke).

Upon the other paw, we lost Richard Feynman, back in 1988; he was the 
bloke who sorted out those NASA management liars, over that little O-ring 
incident...  Well, that's what happens when the suits ignore the 
engineers.
