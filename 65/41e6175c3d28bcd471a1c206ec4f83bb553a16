Subject: Does anybody have an assembler in C?
Message-ID: <19980311163735.37825@freebie.lemis.com>

I'm trying to set up a cross-development environment for 2.11BSD
(running under 4.4BSD), and I've run into trouble because the
assembler's written in, well, assembler.  It would be Real Convenient
if I could find an assembler written in C.  Does anybody know of one?

Tim Shoppa I believe is familiar with the "chip" or "sunchip" tar bundle
that contained a PDP-11 C compiler, assembler and loader. I could swear
the assember was in C - I am sure because I recall fighting with all the
code to port it a long time ago to another UNIX box. Now I was the jerk
that kept saying "gee that C compiler sure looks a lot like the V6/V7
C compiler" (yeah I know they are different - I never bothered to go into
the details of precisely which one it matched more closely).  If Tim
does not still have the contents I know I've got it archived away and
can fetch that part for you.  -- Ken

Vaguely.  I'll try to track down the exact reference - I'm not
sure whether your referring to the DECUS C package or not.

I seem to recall that the DECUS C compiler is written in MACRO-11 assembly -
and pretty much a straight translation of the V6/V7 C compiler - but
with different run time libraries for RSX and RT-11.  Does
this ring a bell?  Or am I completely on the wrong track?

Taking a quick look at the DECUS C package, I see that isn't the answer.
There's an "as"-style assembler there written in MACRO-11, though :-).

I think you were referring to the XINU-11 package available by anonymous
ftp from sunsite:

ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/academic/computer-science/history/pdp-11/xinu

in particular, if you look in

ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/academic/computer-science/history/pdp-11/xinu/
    unpacked/src/cmd/as11

you'll find the "as11" sources in C, specifically written for BSD4.3 on
a VAX.

I have to admit that I'm not fully aware of the copyrights regarding
the XINU package.  If research shows that this is freely distributable,
is this something we'd want to distribute through the PUPS archive,
Warren?

Tim,

No, the DECUS C compiler is a very different kettle of fish.  Sorry to
be so vague - I can only go by memory now as all my archived info is on
CD-ROM's at home.  Back in the mid to late 80's a few folks made available
a bundle put together by the folks at Purdue I think - I believe it was
related to Dr. Comer (sp?) and the Xinu stuff - but this bundle was
intended to provide a compiler environment on SunOS systems of the mid
80's to teach lower level system stuff - I've forgotten if it related
to simulating an 11 or was instead just for a cross-compiler environment
to build Xinu mini-kernels on faster platforms to then download to the LSI
11 testbed.  One place I picked it up (via FTP) called it "sunchip.tar.Z"
or similar, while another I think just called it "chip.tar.Z."

I mentioned you only because I do remember grabbing it from your sunsite
archive while you were still at Caltech and later sending e-mail WRT the
licensing thing.

Xinu is freely distributable, as long as it's not sold as a competing
product to Doug Comer's book. It's in the archive.

Another solution for a assembler in C is some stuff I've got from a
Russian, who `ported' either cc or pcc to a Sparc, as a cross-compiler.
Greg, have a look in .miscfiles. If someone can make some order out of
this, I'll put it in the archive.

To the PUPS readers, there is a whole lot of stuff I've got but I haven't
added into the PUPS ARchive as yet:

	+ System V		(SCO license doesn't include it)
	+ copyright stuff	I haven't cleared it's release yet
	+ unsorted jumble	Someone has to categorise this

I could put the unsorted jumble into the PUPS Archive. Yes or no?

P.S Woke up to a barrage of email today. Wading thru it....

Warren
