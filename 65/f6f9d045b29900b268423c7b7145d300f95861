Thanks Johnny, that was exactly the problem. jove sets the terminal
(or the emulator) into 'Application Cursor Key' and 'Application Keypad'
mode. Looking in xterm at the VT Options popup (with CONTROL-MB2) shows
this nicely. Binding the 'ansi-codes' function of Jove 4.9 (that's what
comes with 2.11BSD) to \[O resolves the cursor issue.

What I still don't understand is why jove comes with defaults which
don't work. It puts the cursor and keypad keys into application mode,
which makes perfect sense especially for the keypad, and than looks
for \[[ rather \[O. Probably to make retrocomputing more fun :).


			Thanks and with best regards,	Walter
