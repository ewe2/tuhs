There are many other satellite internet providers that have appeared since
stargate. For instance:

http://www.infostar.de/knowhow/satfeed.txt

The dnews documentation references them:

"DNEWS can read UUCP bag files in standard rnews format, these are often
used by satellite systems,
the satellite receiver software may write 'uucp' files to a directory on
your system, dnews can then
automatically scan and read in items that appear in this directory."
