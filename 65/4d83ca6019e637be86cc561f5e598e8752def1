Noel is correct. DECtape (aka linctape) was a block oriented technology.  Traditional 1/2” mag tape which had 5, 7 or 9 tracks is a stream oriented technology.   

DECtape was used liked disk in the late 60s.  It was comparably cheap and very reliable.  The joke was you could unroll it and run over it with a car and then roll it back up and it would still work.  

Magtape was traditional back up scheme.  Cost per bit was low and good for archiving.  But you could only add to the end of a tape.  You can do funny things like change recording techniques between files (not recommended as it can confuse many tape controllers but is technically allowed and was done). 

Because of the variable nature of things the OS needs a way to support these behaviors.  Unix makes it pretty easy by letting the user do it all in user space and passing info to the driver.  Other OSs do a lot of work when ‘mounting’ a tape.  But either way simh needs to support these type of functions.  Hence the idea of the virtual tape format that includes meta data to describe things like the size of each block written.  A ‘file mark’ can be read/written (which is special) besides data blocks    

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.
