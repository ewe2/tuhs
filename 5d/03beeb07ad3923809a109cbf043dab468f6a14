From what I've been able to determine, FORTRAN came out shortly after
the IBM 704.  Undoubtedly both were under development at the same
time.  So the question is, was arithmetic IF put in FORTRAN to take
advantage of the CAS instruction, or was CAS added to the IBM 704
instruction set to provide hardware support for arithmetic IF?  Or
maybe neither?

According to the Wikipedia article on FORTRAN, CAS was usually not the
most efficient way to implement arithmetic IF anyway.  CAS takes up
four words of memory and takes three cycles to execute, whereas you
can do it in two words and two cycles with the transfer instructions.
