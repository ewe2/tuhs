Yep.  I found that one, and it actually works.  It was a breeze to set up.

I'm using mktape.c to make tape images, but it doesn't compile correctly on my copy of Windows, so I'm using my Mac to make images, then transfer them back.  But, that's beside the point.
The hard part is finding the standalone utilities like mkfs, restor, etc, and creating a root dump without a pre-existing system.

I got the 4.1c archives from an acquaintance with the CSRG CD-ROMS.  Unfortunately, they're just loose files in a tar archive.  I'll probably try manually compiling the 4.1 stand-alone bits under 4.0, and see if I can create a dump by extracting the tar file onto an empty partition and dumping that...

But, can someone tell me, what program gives that '=' prompt, and how do you get utilities like mkfs, restor, etc onto the tape so that you can load them?  Do you just dump them as separate records to the tape using dd?

Sorry for the newbie-rific questions.  Gotta learn somehow...

Thanks in advance!
