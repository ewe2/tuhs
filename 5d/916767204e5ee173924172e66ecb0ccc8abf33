This.

I work for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.  I'm in the Data Management
group, and specifically in the Science Quality and Reliability Engineering
team.  The 50,000 foot view of what we do is try to bring software
engineering to astronomical software.

In general, the thing about scientific software is that, to put it crudely,
no one gets a Nobel Prize for software.  There's a very strong incentive to
write a thing that will solve whatever particular problem you need solved
for your paper, and no more.  There's also the (highly correlated) problem
that, to an established researcher, graduate student labor is free, and
your graduate students want to finish their thesis, not engineer quality
software.

Whereas what I'd like to do is factor the common infrastructure--of which
there is a lot--out of the various teetering stacks of special-purpose
software and create some sane and maintainable infrastructure that
individual researchers can easily and relatively gracefully extend to
answer their specific questions.
