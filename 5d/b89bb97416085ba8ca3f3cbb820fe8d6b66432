Amen to that!  As the old saying goes, "when in Rome, do as the Romans
do".  On UNIX, tools are expected to send output to stdout.  On
Windows, users expect text selection and ^C/^V copy-and-paste to work.
On VMS, you use the CLI interface to parse the command line.  And so
on.  The principle of least astonishment should always be foremost in
user interaction design.

I used to work in that organization.  The installer situation is one
of the worst cases of not-invented-here syndrome that I've ever seen.
Or maybe it was just empire building by some ambitious manager.  The
"it's easier for us and we can use it everywhere" argument is pure BS.
Any savings that they got from having the a common code base for the
installer was wiped out by all the extra development effort needed to
track the release-to-release changes that the various platforms made
to their software deployment setup.  Their installer was always a step
or two behind the curve, late in supporting new platform features, and
full of subtle bugs and mis-implemented edge conditions.  It wasn't
really "easier for them" in the long run after all.  It was a
maintenance nightmare.
