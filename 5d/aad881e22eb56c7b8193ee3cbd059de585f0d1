But every distribution has its own installer, and they vary wildly.

At the start of the pandemic, we realized really quickly that our older
kid needed a dedicated computer for her use, so I put Mint on an Intel
NUC and gave it to her. It was a delightful experience; very simple,
graphical installer, all of that. It does everything she needs for school
and goofing around stuff. It's great.

The other day, I needed a Linux machine for work. I grabbed another
NUC and put Arch on it. A vastly different experience: much more akin
to installing 7th Edition than Windows or macOS. Oh! And I missed a
step, so I had to pull some shenanigans to fix that.

I'd put the FreeBSD install process somewhere between the two.
Sure, it's textual, but it's pretty straightforward. OpenBSD is probably
a tad closer to the Arch-like experience -- it's not as colorful -- but it's
not too hard[*]. So the experience varies across BSDs, but not that
much, while it's vastly different across Linux distributions.

The ABI compatibility thing breaks down, too. A colleague was trying
to get the host-side of a Salae logic analyzer working on Arch, and it
doesn't. They more or less require Ubuntu 18.something, and that's
not what he runs. As far as most end-users are concerned, your
distribution of choice is "Linux", and distributions vary in all kinds of
ways.

        - Dan C.

I ran into some weird behavior in their bootstrap, though; I traced this
to something slow in the BIOS, did a fix locally, sent a bug report along
with a patch, and got told, "go use UEFI." Meh. Ok.... So I went back
and used UEFI, and the same thing was slow (unsurprising as almost
certainly the BIOS and UEFI flows share common code), wrote back,
and got silence. I pinged again the other week and still haven't heard
anything. Very discouraging. I suspect it's that kind of thing that turns
people off of at least some of the BSDs.
