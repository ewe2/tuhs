I cannot imagine any other real step forward but control-by-
thought, aka brain computer interfaces.  (I personally am even
convinced we will get the brain implant -- ever since i got all
those B and C Hollywood movies from the 50s wrong, back when i was
a kid.  It is convincing still, automatic emergency calls, health
record and cases of incompatibility at hand when needed, and not
to talk about the hints it will give the law enforcement side of
the road.)

Just last year i have seen a report on the current stage of
affairs, Carnegie-Mellon and Minnesota Universities seem to have
build a non-invasively controlled robotic arm, pretty high
precision.

  "Wir haben erhebliche Fortschritte im Bereich
  Robotervorrichtungen mit Gedankensteuerung =C3=BCber Gehirnimplantate
  gemacht.
  We have made substantial progress in the region of
  thought-controlled robotic devices via implants.

  Das ist hervorragende Forschungsarbeit", sagt He.
  "That is superb research work", says He [Professor Bin He,
  Carnegie-Mellon].

  "Nichtinvasiv ist jedoch unser ultimatives Ziel.
  Fortschritte in der neuronalen Dekodierung und der praktischen
  Auswirkungen auf die m=C3=B6gliche Entwicklung nichtinvasiver
  Nutzbarkeit nichtinvasiver Roboterarmsteuerung werden erhebliche
  Neurorobotik haben."

  "Albeit non-invasive is our ultimate goal.
  Progress in neuronal decoding, and the practical usability of
  non-invasive control of robotic arms will have substantial
  effect on the possible development of non-invasive
  neuro-robotics."

 |But I'm a grumpy old man and getting far off topic. Warren should cry, \
 |"enough!".

I personally would love it, if it where only in the hands of
empathic beings, capable of reflection.  Yet it is us. ^_^
