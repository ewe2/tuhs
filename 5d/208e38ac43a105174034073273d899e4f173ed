Subject: [TUHS] Tape images of 2.9BSD for SIMH?
Message-ID: <8dd2d95c0602231353j53ece473kac6def1f728f9fc7@mail.gmail.com>

I was wondering how I can turn the provided TAR files of 2.9BSD into a
proper tape image for use with an emulator? Is a premade emu-friendly
install tape available? I don't have either a real '11 or a physical
tape drive on my computer?
