That's about what I understood from as well from reading this column
at http://www.cfcl.com/rdm/tin/P/199503.shtml

 "The 386BSD release CD-ROM includes a mixture of BSD and Jolitz code,
 articles, and what have you. The files are hyperlinked with a global
 glossary and index to illustrate the structure and interdependence in
 the discussion of the system files.

 Consequently, the CD-ROM release is not freeware, as a whole, though
 many parts of it are freely redistributable. In particular, the system
 itself will be available at certain "official" Internet sites,
 still(unfortunately) to be determined at press time."

and I have dug around long enough to assume that 15 years later it is
still TBD where to get just the system.

The stuff in WinHelp format being useless, ok, but what about the
system on the CD, did you ever try booting and installing it?
