I've heard of a free VAX emulator called SIMH/vax, and a commercial
one named Charon-VAX (or something), but I've tested neither.  If you're
adventurous enough, you might consider real VAX hardware: the VAXstation
3100 and 4000 series models can be had at reasonable cost, and are not
larger than a desktop PC.  As for VMS, at least the recent 7.x versions
are available more or less freely for hobbyist use.

By the way, are there releases of Xenix that run on PDP-hardware?
I've only ever heard of PC (8086+)-based ones.
