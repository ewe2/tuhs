I definitely agree with your words. Furthermore I point to the fact 
that lisp  is totally different to any other language, the archaic 
algol, cobol and fortran languages included. Therefore one makes 
automatically mistakes after longer periods of intensive
lisp coding and vice versa, despite the fact that the lisp approach
basically is very simple, not to say oversimplified. Anyhow there
aren't many lispers anymore. In business lisp plays no role at all.
Its a pet of so backward oriented academicians.
