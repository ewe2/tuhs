Agreed.  That doesn't apply to either piece of code they've shown so
far.  This is http://www.lemis.com/grog/SCO/code-comparison.html
again.

That's the second example :-) The question I've asked SCO is: how
could you have missed the Berkeley license agreement at the beginning
of this file?  SCO have backed off claiming that this is System V
code, and claim it's just an example of their code comparison
techniques.  But on slide 15 of their presentation
(http://www.vangennip.nl/perens/SCOsource_Briefing_II.2.pdf), they
clearly claim that it's System V code.  This suggests that SCO have
recognized their error, though they haven't yet had the decency to
apologize to the BSD community.
