I graduated high school in 1977.     I hadn=E2=80=99t heard anything =
about UNIX but I had hung around the University of Maryland and the like =
enough to know about Digital Equipment Corporation.     One of my =
friend=E2=80=99s mother worked in the doc room a the local DEC office in =
Lanham and being the budding computer geeks we had, we=E2=80=99d often =
stop by the office and pick up whatever manuals she could spare to give =
us.   I had processor handbooks, software handbook, peripheral handbook, =
etc=E2=80=A6 all in my personal library when I enrolled at Johns Hopkins =
that year.

I got a letter from Professor Bill Huggins who was teaching my first =
year course =E2=80=9CModels and Simulation=E2=80=9D stating that the =
course would be taught on the departments PDP-11/45 computer (this I =
found in my documents) using BASIC/PLUS (again a fine DEC product taken =
from the RSTS operating system) on the UNIX  operating system.    The =
last one stumped me.    There was not a mention (obviously) of UNIX =
anywhere in my docs.   Of course, you couldn=E2=80=99t google it back =
then, and I probably could have asked around at the UofM (I had friends =
in various computer installations there) but probably would have not =
yielded an answer.

All was answered a few weeks later when I started classes.    The EE =
department had the PDP-11 and it was run by an organization called the =
UCS (Undergraduate Computer Society) on behalf of the department.   This =
was a group of indeed undergraduates headed at the time by Michael Muuss =
and Pete Koziar.    It was split into groups including the system =
programming headed by those two, documentation (led by George Toth), =
hardware (run by Bill Lindeman), and Operations (Joe Pistritto).    It =
was at an early meeting of this where the whole UNIX things was =
explained to me.    Also, having pretty much BASIC=E2=80=99d myself out =
in high school (We used HP 2000 systems that only ran basic) and was =
desperate for a higher level language (I=E2=80=99d done some Fortran and =
Cobol as well as APL and PLUM (and odd PL/I-ish variant at UofM), I set =
to learn C.     At the time there were mimeographed copies of K&R=E2=80=99=
s document which was the first chapter of =E2=80=9CThe C Programming =
Language.=E2=80=9D    Mike Muuss, always the one to mentor someone, =
helped review my early stabs at C.   I remember typing many of these on =
a Model 33 using \( \) for curly braces, etc=E2=80=A6

I quickly moved through becoming an operator (where you had to =
demonstrate knowledge of the file system structure as well as use of =
icheck/dcheck/clri and the like to recover from crashes).     Mike then =
mentored me through basic system programming.   He printed out a copy of =
the kernel sources for me.    I volunteered to debug some device drivers =
George Toth had written and Mike spent a night half sleeping on a bean =
bag chair in the computer room supervising my stabs at Kernel work.

At that point UNIX did crash a bit and this wasn=E2=80=99t helped by the =
fact that there were many students who thought that crashing or =
otherwise hacking on the machine was sport.     I rapidly became adept =
at working both sides of the scheme, but trying to break the machine =
from user mode and then going back and fixing things (either ones I had =
found or figuring out what others had done).     It was probably the =
only machine other than ones I owned myself that I was deeply involved =
in all aspects of.   The University had a graphics display system =
donated to them and I set about using a DR-11 to interface it.

After college I was hired to do database work on an RSX-11M system.    =
However, the QA department had just gotten in to PWB and source code =
control so I got deputized into helping set up an IS PWB system to =
maintain the source and project documentation.   It was here that I =
hacked on the -ms macro package and the lineprinter spooler to handle =
security classifications.

About six months into it, I ran into Mike and former classmates Bob =
Miles and Doug Kingston at a Unix conference and they told me they were =
porting UNIX to a supercomputer, the Delelcor HEP.   I actually had a =
HEP manual (my friends at the UofM had given it to me after they passed =
at doing the software).    Soon I was back at BRL working with Mike =
doing not only the HEP (I did the ld and F77 ports and all the IO =
system, as well as conspiring with Denelcor=E2=80=99s Burton Smith on =
redesigning the IO system so it had reasonable performance), but also on =
early TCP/IP work.    I was going to use the MIT C gateway (written by =
fellow list member Noel Chiappa) but support from MIT was problematic as =
Noel had been deported to Bermuda (or some such thing) at the critical =
time, so I wrote my own based on my own pidjin operating system, though =
it booted using a UNIX boot block and filesystem.

Among other things I did, having detested the C shell syntax, was add =
many features (notably job control and the TCSH-style command line =
editing) to /bin/sh.  (KSH hadn=E2=80=99t escaped the labs yet).     =
Amusingly, since I sat down at a UNIX conference and explained to some =
guys working on some of the open source shells how job control actually =
worked, my name showed up in many of the Linux manual set as a =
contributor.

Those were really the glory days.    Mike=E2=80=99s standard answer to =
any computer problem at the labs was =E2=80=9CLet=E2=80=99s put UNIX on =
it=E2=80=9D and we usually did.

I then went off to spend several years as a University administrator =
(Rutgers) and then got sucked into a startup Image Processing company =
where I remained for 21 years only randomly dabbling in UNIX.    Though =
several years in I was using a MIPS workstation.    Of course, I was =
using /bin/sh and absent mindedly typed =E2=80=9Cfg.=E2=80=9D    It came =
back and said =E2=80=9CJob control not enabled.=E2=80=9D    That was =
odd, I thought.   It sounds like something I wrote.   I typed =E2=80=9Cset=
 -J=E2=80=9D and it said =E2=80=9CJob control enabled.=E2=80=9D   Holy =
crap, this is one of my shells.    I later found that Doug Gwyn had put =
my shell on his SYSV-on-BSD emulation package tape.    The mach guys =
included the shell from that in all their distributions, so any =
mach-derived system had a =E2=80=9Cron shell=E2=80=9D on it.
