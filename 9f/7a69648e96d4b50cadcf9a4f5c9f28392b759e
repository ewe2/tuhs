Ran into trouble with patch 141.  The /usr/src/bin/ld.c file from 2.10.1
is too old; patches from between that and the initial 2.11 are missing,
and the file gets deleted and replaced at a later level of 2.11 patches,
breaking the history.  Patch 141 uncovers the problem.

I can make the patches work, of course - but it means that for much of
the resulting 2.11 history, /usr/src/bin/ld.c will be wrong.
