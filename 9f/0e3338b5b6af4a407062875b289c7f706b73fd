Reminds me a bit of the old saying: "This is George Washington's

owned it..."

Speaking of how ancient code works... There's still AT&T code dating

replaced, etc. But there's still some bits dating all the way back to
those early times. Having competition from Linux is great and keeps
the BSDs honest...
