The qemu project does this, for the most part. It makes things a lot
easier, but
does take some getting used to to find the proper file to be included. It
helps
a lot to keep the twisty maze of #ifdefs down to a dull roar.

FreeBSD (and all the BSDs) has a similar philosophy. You define the page
size,
for example, of the target, and the rest of the system is written to that
abstraction
rather than having #ifdefs in a lot of places. NetBSD is much better about
keeping
the total number of #ifdefs out of MI code than FreeBSD. In both cases, most
of the #ifdefs are basically #ifdef __HAS_FUNKY_THING <do funky thing here>
#endif that are needed on a couple of architectures, though usually that
idiom
is expressed by a macro (that's empty for most platforms) or an inline
function.

As long as they are always defined... :) Though older gcc/clang compilers
get cranky
when they view the if expression as a tautology (warning about the idiom
rather than
encouraging it: stupid clang tricks).
