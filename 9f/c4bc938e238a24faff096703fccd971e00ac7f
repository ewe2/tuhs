Has it, though?  Most of the stuff I=E2=80=99m working with right now is =
either asyncio and Python, or Javascript, both of which are very much =
about threading.

I think there=E2=80=99s a lot of stuff that does work better with =
multiple program counters for different things executing at the same =
time with shared access to memory, although of course reasoning about =
concurrency is always hard and having to manage locks on things that =
shouldn=E2=80=99t be shared _right now_ is a lot of work and easy to get =
wrong.

I like Go and goroutines and channels as an intra-process communication =
mechanism.

My problem with processes, in the traditional sense, is that there ARE =
often pieces of state you want to share between the things concurrently =
acting on that state.  A channel-like mechanism could work as IPC, but, =
equally well, why _not_ have multiple things=E2=80=94we can call them =
threads if you want=E2=80=94that can just see that shared state?
