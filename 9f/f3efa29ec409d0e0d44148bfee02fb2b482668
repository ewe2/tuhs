	It might be a corrupt freelist.   If that is the case then running
	fsck will detect that fact and reclaim the space by rebuilding the
	freelist.

	My guess is it's "missing" - that can happen if the system's shutdown
	(or the emulator terminated) prematurely.   In that case the freelist
	metadata might not have been updated.

	I see Greg mentioned running fsck.   That sounds like an excellent
	suggestion.

	Cheers,
