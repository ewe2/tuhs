Subject: [TUHS] Happy birthday, Grace Hopper!

OK, slightly OT...

Rear Admiral Grace ("Amazing") Hopper PhD was given unto us in 1906.  She 
was famous for coining the term "debugging", whereby a moth was removed 
from a relay contact in a *real* computer[*].

However, she must be condemned for giving us COBOL; yes, I know that vile 
language, but I carefully leave it off my CV, as it seemed to be designed 
for suits (Business Studies of course, but nothing technical) to spy upon 
their programmers.

[*]
Defined, of course, where you could open a door and step inside it; I 
actually did that once.
