I've been meaning to jump into this, since I own both an 11/05 and an 
11/03, which I'd very much like to run Unix on.  I've also used simh for 
various things (including bringing up 2.9BSD on my 11/23), but I can 
hardly call myself an expert.

Are there any notes you can share on how to get to the point you're at?

Found this in the v6 sources 
(http://www.retro11.de/ouxr/u6ed/usr/sys/ken/nami.c.html).  The code is 
doing a string comparison between the name in the current directory 
entry (u_dent) and the current pathname component (in u_dbuf).   The 
expression in brackets is the relative distance between the two name 
fields within the u struct.  If the if expression evaluates to true, 
then the names do *not* match, and the code loops back to eloop to check 
the next entry.

Since namei() searches for a particular named entry in a directory, its 
reasonable to assume that this particular comparison would fail a number 
of times before finding the correct entry.

 > It seems to check most of the (wrong) directory entries OK, but then 
inexplicably (to me) fails.

In what way does it fail?  Is it simply that namei() doesn't find the 
file its looking for?
