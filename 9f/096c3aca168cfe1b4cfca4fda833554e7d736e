My other favorite Wirth joke (I believe he coined himself) plays fun with the pronunciation of his name:

You can call me by name… VEERTH or by value… WORTH.

As opposed to Niklaus Wirth, who presumably would rather say:

"Testing lower bound, lower bound plus one, lower bound plus two."

 

"Testing: the set N, defined so that there are some elements 'b' and 'e' in N with known values taken from the integers and such that b less than or equal 'e' and every other element is both the natural successor of an element in N and less than or equal to 'e'."
