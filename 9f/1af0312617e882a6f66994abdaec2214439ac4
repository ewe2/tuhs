The "pdp11 peripherals handbook" (1975 edition at least, I can't be bothered
to check them all) says, for the RK11:

  "Tracks/surface: 200+3 spare"

and for the RP11:

  "Tracks/surface: 400 (plus 6 spares)"

which sounds like it could be for bad block replacement, but the RP11-C
Maintenance Manual says (pg. 3-10) "the inner-most cylinders 400-405 are only
used for maintenance".

Unix blithely ignored all that, and used every block available on both the
RK11 and RP11.
