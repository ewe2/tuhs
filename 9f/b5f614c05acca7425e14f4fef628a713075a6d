I know from wearing my FreeBSD hat that random people on mailing lists
often say 'nope' and people go away not realizing they aren't the abitors
of what gets into FreeBSD. We lost a lot of good contributions because of
delays created by scenarios like this...

I also know that getting changes into Linux suffers from this and for a
long time (especially pre-git) was almost impossible unless you knew
someone and were on good terms with them.

Also, people will get frustrated after one or two things don't go up and
they don't do the rest. Or they do one big huge thing that's impossible to
review (maybe it went to the wrong place) and they give up too unless
there's an 'advocate' that works with them to make the changes bite-sized
and sorts out the wheat from the chaff that's almost always in huge change
sets. The process that was documented was hit or miss. Plus lkm wasn't the
nicest of places with the best of interactions, which put off a lot of
people from even trying... Much has been done to improve things in the last
20 years, but for a while things were truly awful for someone without a
huge reputation to get anything non-trivial into Linux. Even today,
projects following the Linux model can be difficult to land changes in,
even when you are nominally the maintainer of a part of the tree...

VPROC was done for 2.6, which is long enough ago to be in the 'bad old
days' of getting things upstreamed.

It wouldn't surprise me at all that enough things were done wrong, and/or
they listened to the wrong people and/or submitted things in the wrong
place they the OpenSSI folks just gave up in frustration early on w/o
getting the right people's attention...
