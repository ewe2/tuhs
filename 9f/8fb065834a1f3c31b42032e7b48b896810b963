Subject: [TUHS] mailing list archive test, please ignore
Message-ID: <20100402112211.GA20924@minnie.tuhs.org>

Several people have noticed that the web archive for the TUHS mailing list
had stopped at June 2009, which was when I migrated over to another box.
Looks like I had a perms problem, which should be now fixed, but this e-mail
is just to test that it is indeed fixed. Please ignore, and/or browse the
old mail at http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/ :-)

Cheers,
	Warren
