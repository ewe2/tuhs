'od' is your friend!

If you look here:

  http://mercury.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/tech/V6Unix.html#dumpf

there's a thing which is basically 'od' and 'dd' rolled in together, which
allows you to dump any block you want in a variety of formats (ASCII, 16-bit
words in octal [very useful for PDP-11 binary], etc). I wrote it under CygWin,
for Windows, but it only uses the StdIO library, and similar programs (e.g. my
usassembler) written that way work fine under Losenux.

Try downloading it and compiling it - if it doesn't work, please let me know;
it'd be worth fixing it so it does work on Linux.

The 0th block does seem to contain some PDP-11 binary - a bootstrap of some
sort. I'll look in more detail in a bit.

From what I can see, it's probably a tp-format tape: the 1st block contains
some filenames which I can see in an ASCII dump of it:

  speakez/sbrk.s
  dcheck.c
  df.c
  intel/as80.c
  intel/optab.8080

You don't need to mount it on DECTape drive - it's just blocks. Mount it as
an RK05 image, or a magtape, or whatever.

Generally there would have been some prior communication, and the person
sending it would have told you what it was (e.g. '800 bpi tar', or whatever).

Like I said: "'od' is your friend!"!! :-)
