Well, informative.  I am not a Germanist.  But *i* do not *think*
that a Swiss (Alemannian?) word "B=C3=B6=C3=B6gge" (that i never have heard,
a Carnival Goblin mask, see [1-4], where [2-4] are "Larve"nmasken,
referring to "Gespenst" aka "Ghost") is related to the family name
"B=C3=B6gge" in mostly northern Germany.  Schwaben/Alemannen on the one
hand, and Sachsen, Friesen, Westfalen, Franken and who knows which
tribes live "normally" where the name distributes[5].

At [5] one can see a very small piece of land at the bottom, near
Lake Constance, where the name distributes.  Maybe someone was
thrilled after visiting that land during Carnival and decided to
move there -- haha! --, i do not know.  You know, Alemannen
Carnival, they sing things like "kill the cat!" or something, and
have cat fur on their belt!  Listen, Hackers!!  ...yeah, twenty
years ago there was an uprising all across Germany after
Alemannian Carnival was shortly seen in the most widely watched TV
news, iirc, where such a masked one was jumping around and singing
this.  Searching the net i find mostly nothing but [6], and there
you can read

  Miau-Zunft Freiburg
  1. Die Website www.miau-zunft.de  ist nicht mehr erreichbar. Die
  Zunft hat bundesweit Proteste ausgel=C3=B6st, da sie gewagt hatte, im
  Internet auf ihre Katzenfell-H=C3=A4stradition hinzuweisen
  2. Zum BZ-Artikel vom 22.12.2001: Katzenjammer bei der Miau-Zunft
  3. Auch unser G=C3=A4stebuch wurde vom Katzenjammer erfasst.  Wie
  soll dies weitergehen?  Sagen Sie uns doch Ihre Meinung
  4. Beim Rosenmontagsumzug am 11.2.2002 war die Miau-Zunft nicht
  feige und trotz aller Bedrohungen tapfer dabei. Aber nur im
  K=C3=A4fig-Wagen. Welch ein Katzenjammer!

That is not that, but nonetheless, part of the nationwide protests
("bundesweit[e] Proteste") that seems to have been.
Cancel culture, everywhere.  You need a lobby though, fur animals
usually not have; nor have cows, pigs, chicken, it is your fault
you have to read this vegetarian pamphlet.

Coming back to "B=C3=B6ge" [7] aka "Boege" [5] as a name, together
about 1100 entries twenty years ago (data from 2002).
For [7] there are some more in the Alemannian / Swabian area.
I do not know.

Hmmm.  Well, given the zappiness and horniness that often can be
found in this corner, the losses we had due to the golden
Californian gang bangs, let me only think of the wonderful Bruce
Chatwin here, there it maybe was a rape, it is terrible!, but
given the sheer amount of popping and other drugs in this culture
i am better silent know.

 |"B=C3=B6g" means a homosexual male in Sweden also. It used to be derogato=
ry
 |but has been adopted by the gay community itself, so it's really just
 |descriptive now (although I'm pretty sure kids still use it as an insult).

So *i* could *imagine* Norwegians pronounce their "b=C3=B8g" and Svedes
pronounce their "B=C3=B6g" maybe a bit like "Bock", short and tough.
Bo-ck, not Booo-ck (english: not buuuu-ck, o!=3Du), or so.
The German "Bock" is a "Ram", the "B=C3=B6ckchen" its minimization
(often not advisable!), and ramification of a Ram is often seen as
desirable (wham! bam! thank you ma'am!, though that false jobsite,
in this case).

Rams they have in Friesland aka Low Saxony.  Oh, the wonderful
"Heidschnucke" ("German heath"), yes, [s]he lives there,
a "northern short-tailed [Heh! sic] sheep".  These horns can
"bocken" aka "buck"ing aka is in the season.
