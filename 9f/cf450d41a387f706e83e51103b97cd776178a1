I'm pretty sure you could, but only on very rudimentary line mode stuff.    Note that an IBM mainframe terminal doesn't really have the same paradigm as an ASCII terminal.

You could go to a VM monitor and type IPL AIX and watch UNIX boot up.

Does that mean that you couldn't access AIX/370 from a traditional mainframe terminal?

That seems bizarre to me.  But it does sound like some other strange things I've heard come out of IBM before.

What would that have done?  Are you meaning an app that would run on
non-AIX/370 OSs that could then act similar to the i860/i386 client / node?  (Was it trying to emulate a traditional serial dumb terminal?)
