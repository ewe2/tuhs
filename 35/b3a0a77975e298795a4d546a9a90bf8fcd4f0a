"inspired" == blatent ripoff to get around the reporting rules of LMbench.
I had pretty harsh words with Jon, that paper should never have been
published, he ripped off the benchmarks and published some of the results
without all of them.

You'll note that Eros is pretty dead, nothing came of it.  It was an 
academic thing in search of a problem and Jon had to cheat to make it
look good.  It's not a good look on him, color me very disappointed
but it isn't the first time some pointy headed PhD dude claimed a
bunch of stuff that wasn't quite true.
