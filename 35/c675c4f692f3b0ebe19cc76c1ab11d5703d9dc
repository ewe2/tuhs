ews, or email, or the plot of some movie I saw an ad for 20 years ago (but =
never saw) on wikipedia is too great and another 45 minutes are gone.

This is the realest description of the modern predicament I have seen!

Depending on mood and day, things can be great or awful with modern
software for me.  In particular, we live in a world of total abundance
which is great but also overwhelming.  There are no shortage of
interesting kernels, libraries, and applications all for free which is
particularly amazing having grown up in the brief era of the PC world
where most interesting software was shrink-wrapped and cost
prohibitive.

I can't help but eventually tie the current status quo back to
economics.  There is a lot of (perceived?) power in flexing a large
staff of programmers, whether they are productive or not.  It's like
having a large standing army during peacetime.  The mere existence
gives you power in the current market.  Look at the first 10 companies
on this list https://companiesmarketcap.com/.  It's safe to say Aramco
has top quality HPC and development staff and the rest are all mostly
pure tech plays with large staffs of developers and systems engineers.

So in a way, we are sustaining Full Employment Theory for people with
*nix skills.  That isn't great for quality.  Early OS work was done by
small teams relative to current, people who really cared about what
they were doing.  The modern situation is great for people's
livelihoods, so unless you are retired make hay while the sun is
shining.

rt of the complexity of our systems is, as Jon asserts, poor abstractions. =
It's like the recent discussion of ZFS vs merged VM/Buffer caches: most peo=
ple don't care. But as a system designer, I do. One _can_ build systems tha=
t support graphics and networking without X11 and sockets and with a small =
number of system calls. One _can_ provide some support for "legacy" systems=
 by papering over the difference with a library (back in the day, someone e=
ven ported X11 to Plan 9), but it does get messy and you hit limitations at=
 some point.

really. We've got the systems we've got. But a lot of the complexity we've =
got in those systems comes from trying to retrofit a design that was fundam=
entally oriented towards a uniprocessor machine onto a multiprocessor syste=
m that looks approximately nothing like a PDP-11. I do agree with Jon that =
much of Linux's complexity is unjustified (functions called `foo` that call=
 `__foo` that calls `__do_foo_for_bar`...I understand this is to limit nest=
ing. But...dang), but much of it is forced by trying to accommodate a parti=
cular system model on systems that are no longer really amenable to that mo=
