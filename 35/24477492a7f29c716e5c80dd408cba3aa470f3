I grew up on 4MB Suns.  Emacs was "8 megs and constantly swapping".
I thought vi was fine though I did do a lot with xvi (I think that was
what it was called) and I hacked it to use mmap to look at the file.
I had to do something about strings to make that work, don't remember,
but it worked and I could vi 4MB log files and search them pretty fast.

I'm a vi guy to this day.  Love it.
