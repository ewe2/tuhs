Subject: [TUHS] History of "sno" Snobol interpreter (V4, Sys V?)
Message-ID: <40DAB418.nailKRX11RMPN@mini-me.trailing-edge.com>

Can anyone comment about the history of the "sno" Snobol
interpreter that seems to exist in V4 (man page in the
archives gives 2/7/93 as the date) and some later
Unix versions (Sys V, V6, etc.)?  In the TUHS archives
we have the V6 sources but they are remarkably comment-
free.

Was "sno" ever part of the build chain of any interesting
utilities etc?

I'm just generally curious about awk predecessors, if
anyone wants to chime in with their favorite pre-awk
string processing tools.

Tim.
