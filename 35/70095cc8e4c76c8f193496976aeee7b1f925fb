I don't think I'm violating anyone's confidentiality by revealing that
Marcus Weldon, current president of the Labs, at the suggestion of
Martin Carroll, expects the Labs to embark soon on plans to mark
the occasion. I, and no doubt Martin, will keep you posted. Meanwhile
I will be happy to forward pertinent suggestions.

Doug
