I meant to suggest that a unix wide convention, with an API to
access config data from programs, may still be of some use.
This should contain user specific configuration in a few lines.

mh for example has a single per user config file: .mh_profile.
It allows you to specify your local maildir's path (defaulting
to ~/Mail). All mail messages and additional state/data is then
stored under ~/Mail or its subdirectories.

So something like "path: foo" can be used store application
specific stuff that doesn't fit in the minimal config model.
The goal would be to cover the majority of programs and
provide some guidelines for more complex applications.

I suspect most of these files contain some state and cached
application data or content as opposed to configuration.  Try
the following from your home dir:

du -a .??*|cat -n|grep -v / |\
awk 'BEGIN{x=3D1;} {print $1-x, $3; x=3D$1;}'|sort -nr|head

This prints out top 10 of total files/dirs under each
top-level dot directory. You can try similar from .config. For
me, most in the top 10 are programs I haven't used in years!

Not shoehorn in everything but support a core set. =

By "one place" I meant something like a ~/etc or ~/rc or
~/config directory but not a single file. A separate config
file for each program (and library) that needs it.

Ideally I'd separate config, state, content and cache. I find
<program>/{config,state,<content>,cache} to be more modular
than {config,state,<content>,cache}/<program> -- what Apple
forces on Macs. Ex: ~/Library/Preferences/org.tug.TexWorks.plist
