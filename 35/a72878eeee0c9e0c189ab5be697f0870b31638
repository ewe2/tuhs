As for reliability.  The CMU IMP at one time was near one of the big
printer from the PDP-10's and often became a temporary resting place for
something if you had to deal with a printer jam, change paper etc.  I have
memories of the time a milkshake got knocked/spilled into the IMP in the
summer of 76 or 77.  IIRC: somebody was smart enough to pull the breaker on
the power.   Then placed a called to BBN and asked them what to do.
 Somewhere I had a picture of a person ??Jim Teter maybe?? acting on the
response in the parking lot: hose it down and the use hair dryers to dry it
out.

It was powered back up and worked and soon appeared a sign about not
putting stuff on the IMP
