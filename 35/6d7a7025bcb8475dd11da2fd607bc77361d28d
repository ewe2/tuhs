It sounds like it could be a simple matter of precision to me.

It takes 32 bits to store a single-precision floating point value.

Double-precision requires 64.  In IEEE 754, the significand is 53 bits
(52 bits plus the implicit leading 1).

I can never remember the C type promotion rules without looking them up,
but IIRC at least in some circumstances C promotes floats to doubles, at
least for intermediate results.  And the software floating-point library
you used could well have done the same, or perhaps it used doubles all
the way internally.  Either of these could have prevented accumulated
roundoff.

I've heard, with a level of conviction somewhere between folklore and
formal demonstration[1], that for many practical numerical problems,
single-precision is just not quite good enough, but double-precision is
ample.  Somewhere between 24 and 53 bits of significant, perhaps, there
is a sweet spot.

The wisdom I've absorbed is, if you have to do floating-point, use
doubles, unless you can clearly and convincingly articulate why you
absolutely need more precision, or can get away with less.  (For same 3D
game-rendering applications, half-precision is adequate.)

A non-quantified "single-precision will be faster" declaration should be
understood to include a lot of "!!1!11" punctuation after it, and such
people should be handled as delicately as any other Gentoo user.

Branden
