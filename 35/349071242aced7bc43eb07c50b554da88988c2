Well, my experience matches Johnny's.  I used many derivatives of 
MicroSoft BASIC - PET, Apple INTBASIC, Applesoft, Exidy Sorcerer, and 
others - and they all start at 0.  AFAIR HP BASIC did so as well.  The 
original 1960s Dartmouth BASIC (for which I have a copy of the manual) 
also started at 0 (cf. page 38); indeed if you didn't explicitly DIM an 
array, you got eleven elements indexed 0...10.
