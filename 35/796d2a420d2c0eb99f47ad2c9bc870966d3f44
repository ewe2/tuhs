Don't know about a TCP/IP stack, but I'm sorry to tell you that Ultrix 
is still proprietary and now owned by hp.

The source is in danger of being lost unless I'm successful over the 
next six months.  The Manalapan, NJ site where a great deal of Ultrix 
work was done will be closing soon and employees moved to other location 
and otherwise.  I volunteered to take the old tape archives and transfer 
the source code to CD-ROM for preservation.  I don't know if there are 
any other copies in Nashua, NH, where the remainder of the work was done.
