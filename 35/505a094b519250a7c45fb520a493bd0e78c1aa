I too am a big 6502 fan.

XINU was a thing …. buuuuut it was written for a clone with weird bankswitching.  https://comp.sys.apple2.programmer.narkive.com/xN2z7e8K/fixing-xinu-for-apple-ii

As mentioned somewhere in this thread, Fusix might work or be workable with a little elbow grease but I haven’t tried it myself.  Doesn’t look like there’s a boot disk set for it.  https://github.com/EtchedPixels/FUZIX

I mean, it’s not going to feel like a modern Unix or even 211bsd if you get it working, but it might be comparable to a Mini-Unix or v6 on a small PDP-11.

So simple, one accumulator and two index registers but it is only 64K of total address - although with bank switching more memory could be added in 4K banks on a number of Apple II's, but you have 16 address bits and worked a register that switched in and out the 4K banks. and there is of course no protection hardware nor the concept of user/kernel in the hardware.  The size of the Apple Floppy disk was rather small, and your need 3 to run things like the UCSD Pascal system to have any experience other than constantly switching disks.

At one time, I had a fairly good version of the Bourne (V7) syntax shell we got running, but it had to be swapped in and out slowly.  That is; you run the shell, type a command, when exec is done, the shell is tossed out and the new program installed in memory.
