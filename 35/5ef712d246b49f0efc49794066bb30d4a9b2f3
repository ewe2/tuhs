But it's source has been part of UNIX 32V, so it has become part of the 
historical UNIX licensed parts and I could take the source to create a modern 
K&R cpp with the features seen on Solaris in /lib/cpp.

BTW: I had to do this port and the related enhancements because "dtrace", "asm" 
and "rpcgen" depend on a K&R cpp that does not destroy line breaks and that 
marks include levels. OpenSolaris requires this "cpp" for compilation.

See: 
https://sourceforge.net/p/schillix-on/schillix-on/ci/default/tree/usr/src/cmd/cpp/

Also see the original README from the "cpp" directory in 32V:

/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
August 25, 1978

Files in this directory form the C preprocessor, which handles '#include'
files and macro definition and expansion for the C compiler.
This new version was written by John F. Reiser and is from 5 to 12
times faster (on UNIX systems) than the old.

To create the executable file 'cpp' in the current directory:
        make
...
