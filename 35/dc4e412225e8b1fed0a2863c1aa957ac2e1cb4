One of my great stories from the early internet days was I received an email from another site that had a from line of:
    From:  Hi There! Will Martin of AMSAA Here <will at amsaa.mil>

I responded by setting mine to:
    From:  Hi There!  Ron Natalie of BRL Here <ron at brl.mil>

Of course, I promptly forgot about it.    Amusingly it got written up in a HUMAN-NETS discussion of signature lines but it also croaked a few people who had imperfect RFC822 vs. UUCP handlers because of the !.
