Hmm, so the 4/110 being VME is for sure correct, I had one of those when
I was at Sun.  The 3/50, I just don't think it was VME.  I believe they
made a version that was a single VME board but so far as I know that was
a different beast.  I could be wrong, I googled a bit and couldn't figure
it out.

What I know for sure is, unlike a 4/110, you couldn't open up the case 
and shove more VME stuff in there.  If the 3/50 was a VME board I'm not
sure what the point was other than, perhaps, to reuse the same part in
a small case.  I can't see Andy doing that, he was super cost sensitive.
