I'm still using the same GUI I've used for the last decade, although its 
name changed.

Personally, I think a lot of Linux people who haven't come from a Unix 
background don't understand Linux, because they don't understand Unix. And 
because they don't understand Linux, they're trying to mutilate it into 
being something other than what it was meant to be.

I thought of creating a system built on top of Linux that represented the 
system as I visualized it.  And I've come a fair way, but I don't yet have 
the important parts (the ability to self-host, including a working kernel, 
C compiler and libc) up and running, but there's pretty much your basic 
stuff in /bin, /usr/bin etc., and there's a curses library, and there's ed 
and vi (more or less)...so once those are available there'll be enough to 
get the rest of it functional.  Of course, as I visualized it will seem 
remarkably antiquated to most people!

-uso.
