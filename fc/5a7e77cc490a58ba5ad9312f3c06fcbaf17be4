I’m running Yosemite, Sierra won’t run on my hardware.

Does the standard expect an int to be a specific size? I can’t imagine this to be the case. On Mac ints are 32 bits, as are longs. Unlike Linux where long defaults to 64 bits.

So keeping the code I work on portable between Linux and the Mac requires more than a bit of ‘ifdef’ hell.
