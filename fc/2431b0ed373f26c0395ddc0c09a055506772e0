Subject: [TUHS] TUHS archives and rsync
Message-ID: <20071226135747.57741969@veda.cnb.uam.es>

On the TUHS site there is a list of other available sites.

If you want you can try mine (ftp.es.embnet.org/pub/misc/TUHS) but be
advised that I try to keep copies of more things than the original site 
and it may be bigger.

I can't remember offhand now if rsync was set up or not and I'm now on
holidays abroad so it's difficult to check (mainly due to the strange
french keyboard).

Anyway, you're welcome and I will make sure rsync works (when I'm back on
January) at my site.
