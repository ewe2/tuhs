Will,

when I brought up UNIX V7 on simh ~10 years ago, I used
Keith Bostic's tape, a simulated PDP11/45, an RP04 disk and
a TU10 tape drive. With this configuration it worked exactly
as described in 'Setting Up Unix'. IIRC, other configurations
had problems, although I never investigated this further.

You can find my package and a HOWTO here:
http://homepages.thm.de/~hg53/pdp11-unix

One note of caution: I did not try to build the whole thing
on a modern 64-bit system; it may well refuse to run. I will
try to bring it up on my 64-bit Linux box and then report
back here, if you are interested.

Hellwig
