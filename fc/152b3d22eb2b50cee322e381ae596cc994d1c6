Subject: [TUHS] Whence the 2.x BSD numbering?
Message-ID: <20090626014427.GA35098@minnie.tuhs.org>

Can anybody explain why the 2BSDs that were distributed with kernel source
code are numbered 2.8BSD upwards. Why start numbering at 8?

P.S Actually I have a 2.79BSD in the archive which came out in 1979 just
before 2.8BSD, so could it be that the '2.79' means 1979, and numbering
followed incrementally after that?

Cheers,
