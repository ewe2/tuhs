If things are filed by provenance, one useful kind of
cross-linking would be a generic tree whose "leaves"
link to all the versions of the "same" file. All the
better if it could also indicate the degree of
relatedness of the versions--perhaps an inferred
evolutionary tree or a shaded grid, where the
intensity of grid point x,y shows the relatedness
of x and y.
