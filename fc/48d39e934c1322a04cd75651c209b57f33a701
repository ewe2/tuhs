Err, according to the 1975 Peripherals Handbook, both are BR6. (Sorry, only
interested in accuracy.)

I don't know about that, but we built two UNIBUS DMA networking devices,
relying on the UNIBUS description in the 1975 Peripherals Handbook, and they
both worked fine (one became a product for Proteon).

The interrupt isn't lost, it's just that the OS does a WAIT when it should
perhaps return and start up some user process - but that resumption of doing
user computations is delayed by at most 1 clock tick (some other device may
interrupt during the WAIT, before the clock does).

I'd be interested in the details of this. The V6 RK driver didn't use them,
but the RK11-D does claim to support them (having spent a modest amount of
time looking at the drawings), so I'd very much like to know what the bug was.

The 11/40 does not have the SPL instruction; see the '75-'76 PDP-11 Processor
Handbook, pg. 4-5. (Again, sorry, just want to be accurate.)

I am only interested in correct data.
