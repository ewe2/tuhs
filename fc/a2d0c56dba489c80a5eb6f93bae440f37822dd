I know, my dad wrote a book with Blue Sky Research's stuff.

I'd like to learn more about that.  I'd done a ton of stuff in troff,
had to do a paper recently in LaTex and I did not find it at all better.
It was a technical paper, usual stuff, text and tables and figures
and references.  I'm not great at LaTex so maybe it's just my bias
but I really like troff.  In fairness, I like groff, I got James to hack
some stuff into pic for me.  

But it started with troff.  I still remember walking out of the computer
science bookstore with a copy of the troff manual.  That was sort of my
introduction to Unix and it fits.
