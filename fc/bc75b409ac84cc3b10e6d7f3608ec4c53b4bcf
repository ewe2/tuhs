I thought that I posted something about this recently when someone
was arguing for threads being unnecessary and bad.

My two cents is that GUIs were the big driver for threads.  I would
personally like to get rid of them as they're "the same but different"
with regards to processes.  My preference would be to solve the
heaviness of processes problem.  I'm not in the thick of that these
days, but I don't see it being solved in software alone; it's going
to take some serious hardware/software architecture work.  Might be
easier to accomplish now that the world has pretty much settled on
the process model.
