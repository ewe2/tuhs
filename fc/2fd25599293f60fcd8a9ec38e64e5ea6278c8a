Yep - cute hack -- Domain (Aegis) did the same trick (same code author most
likely).  The biggest advantage is that open(2) can be used unchanged and
'parameters' are passed in ASCII to the lower code.

You mentioned that BBN Vax code did not use it.  I've forgotten than how
parameters like IP addresses were passed down?  I had thought that Rob had
is also in at least one version of the BBN code, as I remember talking to
him about it at one point; but I have frankly forgotten.   I'm pretty sure
that wnj thought it was an ugly solution; which is why UCB did not try it.

We played with this solution also in the early Masscomp networking code (I
had seen it in the Chaos driver from MIT); but by then the UCB code was
coming out and user code was using sockets, so we just kept with that
interface for code reuse reasons.
