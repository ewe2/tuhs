Possibly metaphorically but this LPAR facility is provided by PR/SM
starting with later 3090s and ES/9000.  There is good coverage in IBM
Systems Journal or IBM R&D journal (I can check my archives for which one
if anyone needs a reference). It=E2=80=99s a firmware hypervisor like pHyp =
or Sun=E2=80=99s
ldom.  VM is a strange yet delightful strain of operating system where full
virtualization was front and center for both time sharing and isolation.
There=E2=80=99s really nothing quite like it although lately things like Qu=
bes and
MirageOS may share some of the delights.
