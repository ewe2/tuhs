In v6 cc(1) still does the job itself. Here is where it actually happens, in expand():

In v7 various files still have # as first character, but the requirement has gone,
https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/tree/Research-V7/usr/src/cmd/cpp

    # cat x.h
     /* */
    #define macro value
    macro

    # /lib/cpp x.h
    # 1 "x.h"
    
    value
    #
