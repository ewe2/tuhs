I’m with you there, and fought some similar futile battles about NeWS (but it was good practice for later more successfully convincing EA to free SimCity). 

I’d totally given up working on NeWS and for Sun before I graduated, but James Gosling promised me that Sun had turned over a new leaf, Scott McNealy was 100% behind it, and they would make NeWS free. 

What actually happened a slap in the face: Sun released the OpenWindows source code for “free” (as in beer, not speech), at only $995 media cost (and no you can’t put it on your ftp server). So it was “free” as in bullshit, actually.
