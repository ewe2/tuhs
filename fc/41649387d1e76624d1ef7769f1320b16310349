oh maybe I meant "streams" not "STREAMS" I always got confused if the
original ritchie spec was upper or lower case. Charles Forsyth coded
it into the York Uni Vaxen, worked fine. I left shortly after to do
stuff at UCL, it only came back into my life when at UQ in Australia
we got an ICL "certified" SYSV host and along side dead technology
like RFS up it popped (I think ICL had coded an OSI stack we were
testing)
