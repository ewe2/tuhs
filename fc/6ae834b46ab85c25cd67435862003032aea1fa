Um, well, while I am a maintainer I have been too busy to pay attention
to it in the last couple of years.  I am the person who invented/wrote the
attachment code for nmh.  I asked and asked for feedback on the design
before implementing it an received none.  Things were find for about a
decade and then all of a sudden folks had a myriad of complaints and made
a bunch of changes.  My suggestion is that you mention this on their
mailing list after making sure that you have the latest stuff installed.
I do recall that a few changes were made some years back which broke stuff
if one had customized the components files for their own installation.
