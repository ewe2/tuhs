SunOS wasn't multi threaded.  Linux seems to have done that pretty well
without getting all bloated (unlike early Solaris releases, I can't
speak to the later ones). 

Linux is just more mature, has had more people working on it (which is
both a good and a bad thing).  And didn't have Sun's stick in the mud
approach to compat that made things like /proc in Solaris way way way
less useful than Linux' /proc.

So it's really hard to say.
