As someone who did a lot of a Ph.D. in the history of computing, and =
then went into IT because he liked eating protein sometimes:

The great secret is that NO ONE EVER READS THE LITERATURE.

We have now made all the mistakes at least four times:

Once for each of mainframes, minis, micros, and mobile.

You can be a rock star at any development or operations job, even if you =
are, like me, a Bear Of Little Brain, simply by having some idea of what =
was tried already to solve a problem like this, and why it didn't work.

Which you can get by actually stopping to read up about your problem =
before diving headfirst into coding up a solution for it.

If you happen to get stinking rich from this advice, you can buy me a =
bottle of whiskey sometime.
