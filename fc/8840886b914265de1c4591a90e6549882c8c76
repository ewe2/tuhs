As the person who kicked off this last round of editor wars by saying I =
wanted =E2=80=9Cs=E2=80=9D on my v7 system to make it into a daily =
driver: sure, ed=E2=80=99s not terrible.  I can, and have, used it, =
although in most places where I *would* use it, I also have sed =
available, and using sed and then comparing the output and the input is =
just as fast for me and carries less risk of hosing my input file.

As line editors go it=E2=80=99s just fine and indeed rather easier than =
TECO or EDLIN, which are the other two I=E2=80=99ve used from time to =
time.  Oh.  And CMS EDIT which it is about on a par with.

But I still find it much less pleasant to use than a moderately-OK =
screen editor, which =E2=80=9Cs=E2=80=9D certainly is.  Largely that=E2=80=
=99s because I don=E2=80=99t think before I type anymore, and I hit keys =
fast and sometimes inaccurately, because the last 35 years have taught =
me that I can always go back and fix it up.

Now that I have working editing-for-the-sloppy and a way that I can =
reliably transfer files to and from v7, really all I need to do is mess =
with the terminal driver so that ^? isn=E2=80=99t =
immediately-cancel-line, because that too is a finger habit too hard for =
me to break.
