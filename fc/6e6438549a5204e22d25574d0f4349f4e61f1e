No, networking in 2.11BSD is not in userland. But it's not a part of 
/unix either. It's a separate image (/netnix) that gets loaded at boot 
time, but it's run in the context of the kernel.

I'd have to go and check this if anyone wants details. It's been quite a 
while since I was fooling around inside there. Or maybe someone else 
remembers more details on how it integrates.
