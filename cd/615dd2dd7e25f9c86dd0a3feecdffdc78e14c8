Early Solaris would not run SunOS binaries; that was fixed later
on. People could then move the SunOS compiler over to Solaris. That was
less helpful that it might seem, as it was a K&R compiler. But it could
be used to bootstrap GCC and then one could go on from there.

As Larry and others have pointed out, the unbundling of various components
was a big mistake by the vendors.  It just made users angry and motivated
them to switch to other Unix systems.

Also, early Solaris was a dog. Performance was poor. It improved over
time, but it wasn't until around Solaris 2.4 or 2.5 that running it
wasn't painful.
