Thanks for mentioning that; I'd never heard of it. Very interesting.


A query: it seems to have been written with access to a set of manuals for the
various early versions of Research Unix. The Unix Tree:

  http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl

has the manual pages for V3 and V4, and V6 and later, but not the other
ones. Do the manuals used for the preparatio of that note still exist; and, if
so, is there any chance of getting them scanned?

(I have a auto-page-feed scanner, and volunteer to do said scanning. Someone
else is going to have to do the OCR, and back-conversion to NROFF source,
though... :-)
