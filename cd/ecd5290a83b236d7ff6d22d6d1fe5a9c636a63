That article (as noted) was originally published in the Bell System
Technical Journal special issue on UNIX.

The System III manuals say something like "UNIX is an operating system
for DEC PDP-11, Vax 11/780 and IBM S/370 computers" so at least within
the Bell System, the S/370 was supported.

It does not seem to have been released to the world, which is a shame;
it may be because of the underlying I/O supervisor which was a modified
IBM OS.
