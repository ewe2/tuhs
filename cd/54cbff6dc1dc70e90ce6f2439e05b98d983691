I'm hoping that this doesn't devolved into another language preference war.
What I really wanted to discuss was the nature of adding value and maybe
nail down what's meant by value.  The roffians versus the texans was just
a good excuse.

One example to me is that while it has it's own thing, perl packages are
available via dnf/apt so one doesn't have to add extra steps to keep a
system up to date.  Things like pear and npm are negative value to me;
they're an extra step.  Maybe the mentality is that someone else maintains
the system and they just maintain their little corner.

My classic example is make.  Works pretty well, was missing a few things
that Sun and Gnu added later.  The negative value stuff is [a-z]make,
ninja, meson and all that.  Does about the same stuff but in an incompatible
way.
