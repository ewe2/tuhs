Subject: [TUHS] emulating old PDP-11's
Message-ID: <20030621145711.84636.qmail@web10006.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,

Seems that SIMH/PDP11, p11 and ts10 do not simulate older PDP-11's

They appear to cover only /*3 (/23, /53, /73, etc) models.

Am I wrong about this?

Are there any open source emulators for the /40, /45, or /70?

I know about Charon and Esatz.

Thanks,
Ken
