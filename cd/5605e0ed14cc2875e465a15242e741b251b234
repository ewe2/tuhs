As a native english speaker...

'ed', as in the man's name. I pronounce 'vi' as you have it above,
but others at work pronounce it as 'vye' (as in 'vying'), so no
consistency there.

We also have local inconsistencies for how JIRA is pronounced,
so don't expect a canonical answer.

I can't say I've pronounced them before, but I think of
former as 'ee-x', I'd be inclined to pronounce the latter
as 'queue-ed'.  Since Q-E-D has its own meaning.

> What about `od'? (That I pronouce ``oh-dee''.)

agreed; otherwise confusing with 'odd'.

But who knows how the authors pronounced them.
