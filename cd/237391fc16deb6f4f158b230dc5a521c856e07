When would this  have been? In 1978 Szurkowski and I went to the then-famed
Atlantic City Computer Show (still in Atlantic-city, pre-casino, so it was
cheap, and very much the place Springsteen wrote about) and stopped at
Princeton and talked to someone who was doing such a port. Would that have
been Tom?

 Charlie can correct me, but IIRC the compiler was IBM's and as Ron said,

I stopped at the now-closed Palo Alto office of IBM in 1991 or so. Some
ex-Locus researchers told me that the 'move to native' for AIX was being
slowed down a bit by the lack of people who knew how channels really worked
... they implied that many of them had retired! Does any of that comment
ring true?
