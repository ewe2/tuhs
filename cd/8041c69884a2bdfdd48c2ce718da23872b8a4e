On the same AT&T archive site, nobody mentionned:

Extract from the presentation:
    This film "The UNIX System: Making Computers More Productive",
    is one of two that Bell Labs made in 1982 about UNIX's significance,
    impact and usability. Even 10 years after its first installation,
    it's still an introduction to the system. The other film, "The
    UNIX System: Making Computers Easier to Use", is roughly the
    same, only a little shorter. The former film was geared towards
    software developers and computer science students, the latter
    towards programmers specifically.

    The film contains interviews with primary developers Ritchie,
    Thompson, Brian Kernighan, and many others.

This film is a "must see" for all tuhs-icians,

Pierre
