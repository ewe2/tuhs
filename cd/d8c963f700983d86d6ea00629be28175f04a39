I was gonna stay out of this thread (it has the feel of old folks somehow)
but 2 comments:

Keith did nvi (I can't remember why?  licensing or something) and he did
a pretty faithful bug for bug compatible job.  I've always wondered why.
I like Keith but it seemed like a waste.  There were other people taking
vi forward, elvis, xvi (I hacked the crap out of that one, made it mmap
the file and had a whole string library that treated \n like NULL) and
I think vim was coming along.  So doing a compat vi felt like a step
backward for me.

For all the vim haters, come on.  Vim is awesome, it gave me the one
thing that I wanted from emacs, multiple windows.  I use that all the
time.  It's got piles of stuff that I don't use, probably should, but
it is every bit as good of a vi as the original and then it added more.
I'm super grateful that vim came along.
