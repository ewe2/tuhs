Well, it's a matter of what counts as "need".  People normally expect
execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", "date", NULL) to work, but it will not on
systems
that define NULL as 0 and have different sizes of integers and pointers
(or, Ghu forbid, null pointers that are not all-bits-0).  The man page is
careful to warn against this practice, but it is commonplace anyhow,
and on such architectures, defining NULL as (void *)0 will protect
users against this situation.

Clear?  Huh!  Why a four-year-old child could understand this report.
Run out and find me a four-year-old child.  I can't make head or tail
out of it.        --Rufus T. Firefly on government reports
