I'd agree to both. Mind you, once you start patching, where do you stop?
We could bring V6 up to being POSIX compatible with an ANSI C compiler :-)

Seriously, at one stage I did think of trying to check-in every version of
UNIX we have into a single CVS repository. Problem is, files have moved
around, and I want to leave gaps just in case we ever get the missing versions.

I might ask Dennis for the details. From memory, the binaries never got out
of the Labs, and it would have been around the time of V6. Also from memory,
this was the topic of Ken's speech when he won the Turing award. I wonder if
the article is lying around somewhere.

Ken's speech "Reflections on Trusting Trust", was published in the
Communication of the ACM, Vol. 27, No. 8, August 1984.  It describes this
"trojan horse" in great detail.  But I do believe from this article that
it was an example of what could be done, not necessarily something that
was ever released into the hands of the public.

Tim Shoppa:
  This brings up a question: should fixes (and I mean fundamental fixes
  like Y2K ones) be incorporated back into the boot images in the archive, or
  should they be left in their "pristine" state?  (Yes, i know, some of
  those boot images aren't quite so pristine.)

I would argue strongly that the archive should contain absolutely pure
copies of any historic objects, whether they were proper distributions
or just snapshots like most of the older boot images.  It's important
to preserve accurate, unbowdlerized history; that is part of what we
should be doing.

There's nothing wrong with keeping fixed-up versions too, but but they
should be clearly distinguished from the historic originals.  (Perhaps
we could label them `ancient' and `primary platform'?)

Even using a CVS repository somehow doesn't feel kosher to me, though
that is probably silly as long as it is possible (and clear how) to
extract the unimproved original, and as long as the very original
distribution or dump tape or whatnot is kept around too so that future
archaeologists have the right thing to study.

So far as I know (from conversations with insiders in the past), no system
was ever shipped out of Bell Labs with Ken's self-healing trojan horse in
login and the C compiler.  (For those who don't remember, both programs
were involved: login buggered so that a secret string was always accepted
as a valid password for any login; the compiler buggered to recognize when
compiling login or itself, and reinsert the buggery.  Hence one can remove
the buggered sources, but as long as the binaries remain, so will the bugs.)

Ken's Turing Award lecture doesn't say whether those programs were ever
shipped to the public.  He probably left it dangling on purpose, since
the point he is trying to make is that it isn't just code you have to trust,
but the programmer who wrote it; you cannot possibly know everything that's
going on inside unless you created everything involved, including compilers
and assemblers and the operating system.

Dennis's Turing Award lecture in the same issue of CACM is worth re-reading too,
especially for those who think that Open Source is a cure for the common
cold or that it was invented in the 1990s or 1980s.

I agree completely.

With CVS you can tag releases, and so you can extract back from a known
release. You can have branches at various points too, and also merge
branches. However, it really needs a CVS guru to make it work properly.
And, of course, when we get to BSD, we should bring the existing
SCCS deltas into the CVS tree, too.

The CVS idea can be someone else's project :-)

Perhaps Ken went even further and distributed buggered binaries of 'od'
as well (along with a 'cc' patch to re-insert the 'od' hole),
so those attempting to hand disassemble the code to *check* for
the existence of the security hole wouldn't find it.

The 'cc+login' hole is nice, sweet, and self-consistent.  Attempting
to patch all the other tools to make it impossible to find these holes
sounds incredibly more complicated.  Maybe it was just the way Ken
so clearly presented the "how to" lesson that makes anything I try to add
onto it sound incredibly awkward.

Has it ever been independently established that this viral 
version of the compiler ever actually existed, or was this 
just a parable about viral code?
