Hi All.

I announceced this some years ago but it's been renewed, so I'll announce
it again.

In 2004 sometime I downloaded all the comp.sources stuff I could from
uunet.uu.net, which was still making it available for anonymous ftp.

I've made a tarball of it available from http://www.skeeve.com/Usenet.tar.bz2

Warren, if you don't have this in the TUHS archives, maybe you could add it?

Thanks,

Arnold
