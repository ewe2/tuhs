I sent a picture (actually two at different resolutions; keep reading) to
the list, but being images they are larger than the address space of a
PDP-11 so not allowed here.

Is it really necessary to have such a low message size limit in an era when
I can buy a terabyte of storage for less than a hundred bucks?

Here is a Google Drive link, for the adventurous.

management wxx dream&quot; (Jim was never at a loss for words); Jim found<b=
r>
some yellow Police crime scene tape and placed it in front of the<br>
doors to the new space. It was redubbed &quot;the innovation space&quot; or=
 some<br>
such, and looked kind of like an ikea showroom. Much was lost. I tried<br>
to find a way to save the contents of the room; I had this dream of<br>
recreating it at Google, much as John Wanamaker&#39;s office was preserved<=
br>
in Philadelphia for so many decades, but I was too late. I have no<br>
idea where the contents are now. Maybe next to the Ark.<br>
<br>
One day in 2008 or so jmk took me for a tour of the buildings, and we<br>
at one point ended up high in the top floor of what I think was<br>
Building One (since torn down?), in what used to be Lab Supply. Nobody<br>
was there, and not much supply was there either. Finally somebody<br>
wandered in, and Jim asked where everyone was. &quot;Oh, they closed lab<br=
>
supply, maybe 4 years ago?&quot;<br>
<br>
Bell Labs had seen hard times since the Lucent split, and it was clear<br>
it had not quite recovered, and Lab Supply was just one sign of it. I<br>
think the saddest thing was seeing the visitor center, which I first<br>
saw in 1976. In 1976, it was the seat of the Bell System Empire, and<br>
it was huge. There was a map of the US with a light lit for every<br>
switching office in the Bell Labs system. There was all kinds of Bell<br>
Labs history in the visitor center museum.<br>
<br>
The museum had shrunk to a much smaller area, and felt like a closet.<br>
The original transistor was still there in 2010, but little else.The<br>
library was, similarly, changed: it was dark and empty, I was told.<br>
Money was saved. At that time, Bell Labs felt large, strangely quiet,<br>
and emptied of people. It made me think of post-sack Rome, ca. 600,<br>
when its population was estimated to be 500. I have not been back<br>
since 2011 so maybe things are very different. It would be nice if so.<br>
<br>
As part of this tour, Jim gave me 3 depraz mice. I took one, gutted<br>
it, (sorry!), and filled its guts with a USB mouse innards, and gave<br>
it back to Jim. He then had a Depraz USB mouse. jmk&#39;s mouse did not<br>
have any lead in it, as John&#39;s did, however. The second I gave to<br>
someone at Google who had worked at the labs back in the day. The<br>
third mouse I gave to John, and he made it live again, which is cool.<br>
<br>
In spite of their reputation, I found Depraz mice hard to use. I have<br>
gone through all kinds of mice, and am on an evoluent, and as far as<br>
Depraz go, I guess &quot;you had to be there&quot;. I don&#39;t recall if j=
mk used<br>
his &quot;usb depraz&quot; or it ended up on a shelf. Sadly, I can no longe=
r ask<br>
him.<br>
<br>
I&#39;ll be interested to see what John thinks of the Depraz.<br>

&gt; A closer look showed that they were the wrappers which cover the corks=

&gt; &gt; &gt; I stuck an Arduino on it and with surprisingly little code I=

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The only problem is that the pointer doesn&#39;t move smooth=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Having just been given a Depraz mouse, I=
 thought it would be fun to get it working on my modern computer. Since the=
 DE9 connector is male rather than female as you usually see with serial mi=
ce, and given its age, I speculate that it might have a custom protocol; in=
 any rate, plugging it into a USB-serial converter and and firing up picoco=
m has given me nothing.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone have a copy of a manual for =
it, or more information on how to interface with it? If I knew how it was w=
ired and what the protocol looked like, I expect I could make an adapter pr=
etty trivially using a microcontroller.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This might be of some help?<br>
