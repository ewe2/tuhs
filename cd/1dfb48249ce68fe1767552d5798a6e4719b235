Indeed, research Unix never allowed ordinary users to
change a uid. And even in the first edition, the superuser
was not allowed to do so on set-uid files, presumably to
prevent inadvertent laying of cuckoo eggs. The v6 note
about interaction with accounting reflected field
experience with the overly liberal stance of other Unixes.
