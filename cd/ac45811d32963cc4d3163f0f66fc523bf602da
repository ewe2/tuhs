I use ex exclusively, being willing to trade a little standardosity for
a little more user-friendliness.  I have no trouble switching to ed if
necessary (as when /usr is not mounted, though nowadays /usr is typically
on the root file system).  It is certainly ingrained in my fingers;
I'm using it to write this email.  I usually write scripts for ed rather
than ex, as I usually write shell scripts for a Posix shell, not for bash.

Very occasionally I switch to vi mode, mostly so I can use the % key
when editing Lisp, or to edit a highly repetitive line (try changing
"one one one one one one one one one" to "one one one one one two one
one one one" with ed/ex alone!)  The only vi commands I know are h, j,
k, l, x, i, %, and most importantly Q, which gets me back to ex mode.

My answer to "What's your IDE?" is "Console running a bunch of 'ex'
tabs and one shell tab for typing 'make'."

I've tried to switch to sam several times, but so far without success.
The lack of arrow keys is annoying for close-up editing, and since I use
Windows as a terminal to hack remote Solaris or Linux systems, the lack
of -r in the Windows version of sam is very annoying.

Agreed on all points.  See esr's "A Tale of Five Editors" at
<http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch13s02.html> (be sure to
click the "Next" link for his analysis).  I contributed much of the sam
and acme/wily sections.  (I know you've read this, since you are quoted
in it, but others here may not have.)
