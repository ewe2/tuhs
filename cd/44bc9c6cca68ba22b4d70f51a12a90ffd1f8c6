Subject: [TUHS] What's planned for mid-2019 for Unix's 50th anniversary?
Message-ID: <20151125044920.GA18103@www.oztivo.net>

I know that I'm jumping the gun a bit, but if/when someone has any news
of any 50th anniversary celebrations for Unix in mid-2019?

I'd love to start planning things now, given I'm in Australia and I also
need to convince my darling wife of the need for a holiday in the U.S
[or elsewhere 8-) ].

I will keep asking every six months.

Cheers, Warren
