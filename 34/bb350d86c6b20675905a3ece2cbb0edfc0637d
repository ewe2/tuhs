I defer to Clem on these.

As I heard it, Lorinda wrote the Writers Workbench, a name pun on PWB, 
of which style and diction were the cornerstones.  I thought she was at 
Bell Labs at the time.  I recall a Bell Labs written summary booklet of 
DWB, although I can't find it in my museum.

I also heard that Ted K (aka "frodo") got fsck released to Berkeley by 
swearing (somehow with a straight face) to the Bell Labs lawyers that it 
had no commercial value.
