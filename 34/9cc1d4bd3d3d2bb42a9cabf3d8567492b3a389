Amusing thing on parsers.    I had written a short C subroutine to eat =
HOSTS.TXT directly which we used rather than the Berkeley /etc/hosts =
format.
It presented the same interface to the caller as the Berkeley one.

We found out that when we added a host with a type "68000" that we =
suddenly broke every straight BSD system.   Apparently, they used a YACC =
grammar to parse HOSTS.TXT into /etc/hosts and had screwed it up =
assuming the machine type field (like the hostname) had to begin with a =
letter.     It didn't help that the machine we added was named =
"BRL-ZAP."    There was some discussion that we had done this =
intentionally.    I pointed out that a YACC grammar was way overkill and =
there must be some existing file on UNIX that has fields separated by =
colons that there was simpler stuff written to parse =F0=9F=98=8A    =
Anyhow, for expedience Jake just added an "MC" on to the machine type to =
appease the Berkeley toadies.

There was a protocol defined to download the host file which we ran =
nighly .
