Oh man. I had to go look it up and I found a copy on some website at
Lejeune and another one at training command. It looks like the NATO
standard *9* line request plus a line for patient information (name,
initials, last4, etc). Odd considering that if you've got multiple patients
you'd need more than one "line". Anyway, there's a copy in this document:
http://www.trngcmd.marines.mil/Portals/207/Docs/TBS/THULS.pdf (search for
"CASEVAC").

Neat. What branch were you?

I used to get super-annoyed when higher would muck with my manifests which
were, of course, Excel documents. "How do you know these total numbers are
correct?" "Because that cell is a formula that is the sum of all the other
relevant cells and unless you think that Microsoft can't ADD then there's
no reason for it to be incorrect. Please tell Lance Corporal Schmuckatelli
to stop overwriting my shit because he definitely can't add. Oh, and he
should probably get counseled to go take, 'Math for Marines' again; this
time without cheating and copying the answers out of the back fo the MCI."

I've often noticed the battlefield is ruled by Windows (e.g. those

Those helo pilots were just sitting on chairs eating potato chips in an
otherwise empty shipping container out at MOUTown and making things up as
they went along.

Funny, the BFT in my M-ATV ran Linux. I got the guys down at the
maintenance depot to give me login name and password for their account so I
could play solitaire when nothing was going on.
