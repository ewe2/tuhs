Hawley built the first mice used by PARC.  The first optical mouse was =
invented, AFAIK, by Dick Lyon, see =
http://www.dicklyon.com/tech/OMouse/OpticalMouse-Lyon.pdf =
<http://www.dicklyon.com/tech/OMouse/OpticalMouse-Lyon.pdf>  This paper =
has a brief history of Xerox mechanical mice as well.

Dick is just a renaissance engineer, with contributions to hearing aids, =
the Fovea camera, and he later designed the Google Street View cameras. =
His book on Human and Machine Hearing is outstanding.
