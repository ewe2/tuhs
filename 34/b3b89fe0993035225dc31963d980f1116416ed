The terminal rooms bring back memories.  I learned *so* much looking
over someone else's shoulder and going "how did you make vi do that?".

The CP/M machines bring back different memories, using that and BDS
C because an 11/780 with 4MB of ram and 40 users meant each user was
getting 1KB so it swapped and swapped and swapped.  128K less the space
for video on a CP/M machine was slower when you had the VAX to yourself
(as in never) and much faster in general.  Wrote a boatload of funky C
code on my CP/M machine.  More lonely but more productive code wise.
