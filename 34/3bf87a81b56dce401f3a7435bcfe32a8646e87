Now that looks like a quite special hack to me,
The mentioned d22.tar.gz -> d22/sys/sys.tar.Z -> sys/sys1.c has
# define SCRMAG  "#!"
# define SCRMAG2 "/*#!"
# define ARGPLACE "$*"
# define SHSIZE  70
# define ARGV    11
it accepts both #! and /*#! (equivalent), 70 chars, at most
11 arguments, and explains (russian guessed and then omitted here):

usually

    script x with "#!CMD A1 A2 A3"
    called as "x B1 B2"
    results in "CMD A1 A2 A3 /.../.../x B1 B2"

while in D22

    script x with "#!CMD A1 $* A2 A3"
    called as "x B1 B2"
    results in "CMD A1 /.../.../x B1 B2 A2 A3"

I haven't seen such anywhere, but not the above until now, either.
But I believe that you can discard those which are listed here
http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/#results
from your list of candidates.

Well the original implementation (post 7th ed and 4.0/4.1 BSD)
didn't allow arguments at all ;-)  But multiple arguments
definitely is the minority (AFAIK Plan9, some FreeBSD,
MacOSX, Minix, BSD/OS, and some early cygwin).
