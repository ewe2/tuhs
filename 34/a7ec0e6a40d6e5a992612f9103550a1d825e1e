I think that this is off-topic now, so I won't respond further in this thread.

Indeed, *because that's the only way you can do it without quotas*, which was my whole point.

For instance imagine I want to pass some customer data to which I have access to you, who con't have access, for purposes of malice.  I know that leaving a world-readable file will be spotted.  So I put them in a file which is 600 in /tmp, and chown it to you.  Not only can't this be easily spotted without system-call auditing (which people generally do not do), but if it is spotted it looks like it's your fault since you own the file.  File ownership does matter.
