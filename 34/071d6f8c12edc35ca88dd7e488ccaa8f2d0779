  Because of the design bug I mentioned, I searched for UNIX sources from AT&T
  that include streams support, but could never find any.

=====

None of the Research systems after 32/V was ever distributed except
to a handful of sites under site-specific letter agreements that
forbade redistribution.

This is a bug, not a feature, but there it is.  It was easy to get
approval to write a paper, much harder to get permission to distribute
code, especially when the code in some way overlapped the Official
Product.

Warren and I (and Dennis, when he was still alive) hoped to do
something about some years back, but it's a lot harder than it used
to be because it is harder to find a corporate entity that is
confident enough to give permission, even for stuff that is so old
that it is unlikely to have a trumppenceworth of commercial value.
Then IBM vs SCO intervened, and now things are even more fragmented.

There may be other efforts under way now and then to negotiate the
legal minefield.  I wish them all well, and will help them where I
can.
