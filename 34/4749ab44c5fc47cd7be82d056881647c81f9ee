Nope. The TOY clock don't generate interrupts.

	As Billy pointed out the TOY clock does not generate interrupts.  The
	line frequency clock does but the TOY clock does not.

	Looking at the Ultrix-3.1 sources I found something that may be
	relevant in sys/errlog.c:

/*
 * Log a stray device interrupt.
 *
 * A stray interrupt is defined as one that occurs for
 * a configured device through a valid vector address,
 * but is unexpected. In the case of big disks, a stray
 * interrupt is logged when the interrupt service routine
 * is entered and the device is not active and no attention
 * summary bits are set.
 */

	One guess is that other systems do not use or concern themselves with
	'attention summary' bits and simply dismiss the interrupt without
	comment.

	Looking at the errlogs (I do not know what the commands for doing that
	are but a big of digging would probably find them) might yield more
	information.

	Cheers.

Rats,
This means that it won't be simple to fix!!!!!!!!

It could mean that running Ultrix on a simulator isn't on without some
work on the emulators themselves.  When the SI message is generated it
comes out with a number that looks like an address.  Would this point to
the source of the interrupt?  On p11 it is a constant address, I just
can't remember what it is for the moment.

Cheers

Robin

Well, that's my estimation.  I thought at first it was harmless, but
work I have attempted over this weekend using the Supnik emulator has
changed my mind.

Let me guess: 176700.  :-)

It's the csr of the device that issued the stray interrupt.  My guess is
your having the same trouble with p11 that I am having with Bob's.  It's
the hp device and every RP disk access causes stray interrupts.

*sigh* The Begemot emulator has bitrotted a little.  I can no longer
get it to work, though admittedly I didn't try very hard the last
time, and it may be something as simple as a corrupted disk image.
But the other thing is that the Begemot ftp site is no longer
accessible, which is somewhat embarrassing, since I host it.  I'm
copying J�rg Micheel and Harti Brandt, the Begemot people, and I hope
that we'll get it up again soon.  J�rg, Harti, the problem is that I
migrated a system disk, and seem to have lost the connection to the
ftp files.  You should find them somewhere on the file systems
/freebie or /freebie/usr, which are the old system disk, still
spinning.

I have been running Ultrix-11 V3.1 on Ersatz-11 without any of that. It
_could_ be linked to interrupt latency issues- Ultrix tells controller
to do something (e.g., three commands to read a sector).  Controller does
as told, generating an interrupt for each of the requests saying its ready.
However, because of latency, only ints 1 and 3 actually get delivered within
the expected timeframe (can happen).

Usually (from my experience with writing Unix kernel drivers), this is not
a problem, because the "message" from (in this case) int2 will be picked up
when we start to service int3, which we _did_ see.  So, even though we didnt
get int2, we were fine.

Now... emulator wakes up again, goes "oi, i messed up, better go send that
int now" and sends the int.  The driver no longer _awaits_ an interrupt
(because
we cleared the AttentionNeeded flags when servicing int3), so... we get the
"stray int" message.

If this logic is correct, it will get worse when loading the host system
heavily, so latency will occur more often.  On a very fast box (like my quad
CPU
P3/850 Linux box) it should hardly occur.

Anyone?

Hi all,
	
	A while ago I floated the idea of a web-browsable set of old Unix
distributions, along with a way of finding out how each file evolved. Well,
after a bit of coding on the weekend, I now have this available. It's
called the Unix Tree, and the URL is http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/UnixTree/

Because of the license restrictions, you need your normal UNIX Archive
username and password to browse.

I've only inserted research editions up to 7th Edition for now, in case
I have to make major changes. However, tell me what you think.

Cheers, and off to have some lunch.

	Warren

Based on my experience over this weekend, I can definitely agree with
all of the above.  It makes perfect sense and goes a long way toward
explaining my problems.

I can also vouch for this.  I finally gave up on trying to do anything 
I/O intensive on the emulated RP disk.  Emulator was continuously
crashing.

While this is not a solution most people here are likely to be able to
apply :-)  I also have doubts that it will solve the problem.  I also
doubt that the problem is as easy as just throwing away the stray interrupt.

I have done some work on the emulator last autumn and plan to release
a new version Real-Soon-Now(tm). Well, I think I will to a

kill -STOP `cat /var/run/currentwork`

and try to do it in the next couple of days.

Please watch the alt.sys.pdp11 for an anouncement.

Disc images work directly (at least the images from Bob Supnik do).

Hi.

Yesterday I installed 2.11BSD on my PDP11/73. Everything went fine up
to the first time when UNIX was booted. The kernel came up, init was
started, autoconfig run and printed out the devices it had (not) found.
My disk and tape were found but then, after printing:
-----

it hangs. Characters I type into the terminal are echod, but nothing
else happens. The "Run" LED at the front panel is of. I tried with an
other CPU und memory card, but the same happend.

System configuration:
11/73 (M8192), one with FP accel. or one without. (Jumpers W1..W6 in,
W7..W9 out, so that the CPU enters ODT at power up.)
4MB or 1MB memory card (non DEC)
Sigma DLV11-J clone for console (CSR 1765{0,1,2}0 and 177560)
TK50 with TQK50 (CSR 174500)
RA54, last week reformated on a MV2000 with RQDX3 (CSR 172150)
BA23 from a MVII.

BTW: What serial parameters does 2.11BSD use? The first time I booted
UNIX I got garbage after "user mem  = 307200". I seted the vt220 to 7e1
and this worked, but is it correct?

Yeah, I figured this out a while ago. Unfortunately, I'm in the middle
of changing employers so everything's in boxes at the moment.

Basically, the swap space is hard-coded into the device drivers. If you
take a look at, for example, the RK05 driver you'll see that one of the
drives is smaller than the others. That extra space is the swap space.
I forget how the rest of the system is informed of the swap space, but
it's done in the disk driver sources IIRC.

I took a quick look at this this morning and as Roger says, the kernel
is built with a wired in swap.  In the case of the kernel 'rkunix,' in
looking at usr/sys/run or something like that, I see they are wiring
the swap to be device major=0 and minor=0 which is the root RK05 drive.

Looking at the code it seems the first 4000 blocks are file system and
a following 782 (or something like that) are for swap.

The "ps" command source appears to be poking around /dev looking for a
block device that matches the kernel value for swapdev (or something like
that) and confirming it is a block device.

Yet I see I have /dev/rk0 mknod'ed 0/0 and it is a block device but "ps"
still gripes about "no swap device."

So I'm missing something I guess.

	That looks good - and familiar ;)

	The next thing that should have come out is the '# ' single user
	prompt.

	That sounds like the system 'halt'ed for some (unknown) reason.

	Sigh - that kernel should work fine, especially with a RQDX3/RD54.  I
	am at a loss to explain/diagnose the problem.

> System configuration:

	There is a jumper (I forget which one) that enables/disables the
	'halt' instruction.  If 'halt' is disabled then the 'halt' instruction
	is treated as a 'nop' even in kernel mode.  If 'halt' is enabled then
	the console ODT will be entered if the kernel executes a halt.

	Looks like we'll have to try and solve this the hard way ;(

	After the system hangs press the 'halt' button on the front of the
	machine and note the PC - hopefully that value will give a clue as
	to where the kernel is at the time (likely in a clock interrupt).

	Yes, 7e1 is correct - a legacy setting from eons ago.
