Hm, OK.  I recall actually seeing the trick performed on
*something* though.

(I hooked up an old ASR 33 to someone's system with a current loop
circuit at one point, plus a bit-bang driver, and I thought I
remembered it being this particular ASR 33 on which I saw the trick,
but it might have been something else.)
