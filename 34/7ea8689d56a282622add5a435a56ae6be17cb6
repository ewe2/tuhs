I recall that there were other differences as well, but only minor.  In my 
paper in AUUGN titled "Unix on the LSI-11/23" it will reveal all about 
porting V6 to the thing.

I vaguely remember that the LTC had to be disabled during the boot 
process, for example, with an external switch.  Then again, I could be 
thinking of some other weird box to which I'd ported V6.  As far as I 
know, it was the first such port in Australia (if there were others then I 
never heard about them).
