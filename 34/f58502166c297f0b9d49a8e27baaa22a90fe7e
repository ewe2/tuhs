As a long-time Unix user (since around 1978) I agree with the above: the lawsuit was definitely not very high in my concerns when I wanted a Unix on a cheap PC, I just wanted it to work and, at the same time, I appreciated the impossible ecosystem which the PC brought along with a gazillion different cards all requiring a special driver (I am thinking, in particular, of the “SuperIO” card which my 386SX had to provide two RS232 ports, a parallel port and a 3 1/2” drive - made in Taiwan, zero documentation, etc.). The Unix machines I had access to via work/study were all “big iron” coming from large manufacturers and totally out of my price range.

It was also really rather easy to share a floppy disk amongst friends whereas copying a CD or a tape was really very expensive for a student/amateur.

Absolutely true.

I would have never tried Linux had it been possible to install FreeBSD/NetBSD on the PCs I had access to from a floppy disk. This changed around 1994 when I managed to boot NetBSD from floppy on a Dell 486SX with very specific hardware (network card, etc.) which I had managed to find thrown away by a big bank in the City.

My dream was a Sun but all I could afford was a 2nd hand battered 486SX…
