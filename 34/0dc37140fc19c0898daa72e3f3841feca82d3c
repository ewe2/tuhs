Yea. This copy looks like it has been applied and has the commentary on
it.  A rather nice find. There are a plethora of copies of v6 with changes
here and there for bug fixes and new drivers.

The other nugget is that "many of the changes ... are in our own sources"
suggesting they are in AUSAM since unsw was part of that effort...

I'll have to audit the diffs between v6.5 and v7...

I=E2=80=99m not sure where the story of it coming from Lou comes from (I=E2=

Wikipedia :). It comes from our friend Warren:

e-of-unix/0>

Maybe he can say...
