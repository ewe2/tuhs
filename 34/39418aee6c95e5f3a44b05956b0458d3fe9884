I'm not sure I'd call ITS 'smaller'... :-)

I wasn't sure if there was a separate kernel stack for each process; I checked
the ITS source, and there is indeed a separate stack per process. There are
also three other stacks in the kernel that are used from time to time (look
for 'MOVE P,' for places where the SP is loaded).

Oddly enough, it doesn't seem to ever _save_ the SP - there are no 'MOVEM P,'
instructions that I could find!
