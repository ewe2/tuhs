Seems like a case of winners write the history books.  There were
corporate and public access networks long before TCP was set in stone
as a dominant protocol.  Most F500 were interchanging on SNA into the
1990s.  And access networks like Tymnet, etc to talk to others.

TCP, coupled with the rise of UNIX and the free wheel sharing of BSD
code, are what made the people to talk to.
