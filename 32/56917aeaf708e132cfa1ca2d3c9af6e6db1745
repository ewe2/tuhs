The way it felt to me at the time was yes, you could, maybe, get access 
but it was proprietary source code.  If you put it up for FTP you were
going to get sued or something.  It was not freely available.  

You keep saying that 386BSD was up for FTP as a poorly kept secret. 
Why was it secret?  Because it wasn't legal to get it.

A lot of us were pretty sick of that legal bullshit.  Linux didn't 
have that problem.

I think most hackers wanted it to be free, though even there it was
sort of hit and miss.  The BSDi guys thought they saw a market 
opportunity so they weren't so excited about free.
