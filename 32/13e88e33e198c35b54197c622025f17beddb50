I think that is true. But from my point of view "linux winning" was not
necessarily "linux was better at the time." I think it was a lot of factors.

When I got to Los Alamos in 1999, it was still a tossup between the BSDs
and Linux as to "which is better." Nevertheless, for lots of reasons, in
1998 (the same year I found Linux to be less reliable over time) Los Alamos
had cast its lot with Linux, for all kinds of reasons.
