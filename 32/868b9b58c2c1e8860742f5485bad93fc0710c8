Indeed. One of the reasons that USL settled was because they released 32V
without the proper copyright notices (whatever that means, but in this case
there were none at all in the media) and the judge issued a preliminary
ruling declaring that 32V didn't have copyright protection. They were
scared of losing that and that motivated them to settle.

Interestingly, in the settlement, USL specifically agrees not to pursue
trade secret claims against anybody using 4.4BSD-lite, but copyrights
aren't mentioned, outside of the restricted files getting an USL copyright
added:

"c. USL agrees that it shall take no action against any person who utilizes
any methods and concepts in the restricted
files which as of this date have become available to the general public by
acts not attributable to the University,
its employees or students...."

and "i. USL agrees that it shall take no action base on the use or
distribution by any person of material
contained in the Unrestricted Files."

also (for another message in the thread)

"f. USL agrees that it shall affix the University Copyright Notice and the
University Acknowledgement to the
files in exhibit C.." Where the wording of those phrases is defined
elsewhere in the settlement. And there's
about 8 paragraphs as to exactly how AT&T will do this in both code and
documentation...
