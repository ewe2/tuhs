Subject: [TUHS] ancient unix filesystems --- on current Unix implementations
Message-ID: <3CD85C3D.22602C76@nktelco.net>

Does anyone know how many of the V5, V6, V7, 2BSD, 2.11BSD, etc. filesystems are
implemented in some current unix implementations, NetBSD, Linux, etc. Seems like
that could be useful when playing with simh.
