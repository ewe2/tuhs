By the way - why do you think 2.11 BSD would be better to port instead of the
original 4.3 BSD? The system has no 64KB addressing limitation. It can adress
up to 128 64KB segments (=8MB). I mean, on a first look, it looks like 2.11BSD
contains a lot more Assembler Code I would need to move to Z8001 ASM mnemonics
as 4.3 does?!
