Still further off topic, but it reminds me of a Y2K incident circa 1960.
Our IBM 7090 had been fitted with a homegrown time-of-day clock (no, big
blue did not build such into their machines back then). The most significant
bits of the clock registered the day of the year. On day 0x100 the clock
went negative and the system went wild.
