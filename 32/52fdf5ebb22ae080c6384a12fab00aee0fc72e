​What's coffee - try beer glass/plastic cup.

Once nice thing about raised floors is they kept your beer cold.   On
weekend if we were having a party, I would bring a gallon milk jug fresh
from the tap's at my fraternity and put it under the floor.

I could usually bribe another operator to stay over for an unpaid hour or
so when the backups first ran.   Then we would finish our beers and if I
was lucky, the "console bell" was a fire alarm.  So with a patch to the TSS
kernel you could get it ring the console bell when the system needed human
attention.  I could then go into the printer paper room where there was an
Tek 4010 graphics tube.  Thus I could either go off to hack for a while
 knowing that I would be called if the system needed me.​
