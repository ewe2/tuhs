On all this old school stuff - just in case you think it doesn't matter,
it does.  One of the best guys I have here is a guy who did printer 
firmware.  I had to teach him what a cache was, he had never seen one.
But holy moly does he hold the whole picture in his head.  And has 
forgotten more about SCM than I'll ever know (we do that stuff, 
BitKeeper, etc).

People who understand the hardware are useful.  I cringe at what we 
call a CS degree these days.

And BTW, if you are one of those old school guys and want a job, hit 
me up.  We're very picky, we have a ~8 year retention rate, but that's
because we make sure that you will be happy and we will be happy.  If
we have one good hire a year I'm ecstatic.  Gotta be Bay Area for the
first year though (you can live in my guest house in the redwoods :)
