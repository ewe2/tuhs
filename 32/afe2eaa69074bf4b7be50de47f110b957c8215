Subject: [TUHS] PDP-11/23 questions ...
Message-ID: <20060608171557.GA16159@freaknet.org>


Hi dudes,

We recovered an almost working pdp-11/23 and some other stuff
for our computer museum. Some images are online at
http://dyne.org/museum :)

well, 2 questions:

1) we lack the power supply of the 11/23 cpu. From the
   schematics, we see that only +5V, +12V and -12V are required,
   so we will try to use a normal PC power supply for the QBUS
   backplane; does somebody know about problems in doing this?

2) what kind of UNIX can be run on an 11/23 using a RL02 disk
   drive? (just one, unfortunately :!)


that's all folks! *:)
