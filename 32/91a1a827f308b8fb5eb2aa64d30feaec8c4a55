"Joint project".  Hmm, I was at Sun at the time, John Pope was across
the hall from me, he did the SVR4 port to Sun/SPARC.

To call this joint is complete nonsense.  Sun was in a cash bind, AT&T
wanted to make SVR4 the main Unix platform and SunOS was winning.  The
story I heard, not widely known, is that AT&T bought a big pile of Sun 
stock at 35% over market - in return for which Sun had to dump their BSD
based SunOS and go to SVR4.  

Biggest mistake Sun ever made in my opinion.
