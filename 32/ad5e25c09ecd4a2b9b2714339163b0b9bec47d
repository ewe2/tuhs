Remoting single GUI apps can be useful in a scientific workstation and
similar settings (for example, managing some turbine in a power plant,
etc.). But remoting full, integrated desktop environments is more useful
for clerical office work and for remote administration of GUI-based
operating systems, or for remote administration of some workflow which
involves several GUI applications in a tool-chain kind of workflow.

IMHO.
