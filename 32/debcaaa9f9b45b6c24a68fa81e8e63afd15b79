Back a long time ago, I ran OS/9 on a 6809E Tandy Color Computer 3.  The
relationship to Unix is that it was obviously inspired by it, especially
Vx where x <= 6 [or perhaps 4 or 5, the block diagrams describing OS/9
could have described the older Unix systems ].  One of the items I
worked on quite extensively was the UUCP implementation.  I didn't write
the original C code reimplementation that it used, but modified it quite
a bit and one of the items I added to it was the ability of the g
protocol to handle a bigger packet window and probably to handle bigger
packets.  At the time I dialed it into UUNET once or twice a day for
email and some very small amount of Usenet news.  This all would have
been in the 1992 - 1994 time frame.  So, ya, the UUCP g protocol could
be fiddled with somewhat and it would likely work.
