You're presumably not talking about a Tandem format here.  Were you
working with Denis Winn?

Presumably you *are* talking about Tandem's format here.  I always
looked at it as an indication of how badly optimization attempts could
go wrong.  The format limited line length to something less than 256
bytes (exact length was content dependent).  The lines were split into
groups of up to 30 bytes, 15 bytes content and up to 15 bytes trailing
spaces.  And this was the reason: it was a piss-poor attempt at
efficient storage.  The only way to access it was with a special
library with procedures like EDITREAD and EDITWRITE.  I still have a
number of these files, and there's no easy way to convert them.
