About a year ago the Research telephone switch came up on this list.

I=E2=80=99ve been having an off list discussion with Bill Marshall and =
this PBX was influential in another way as well.

First of all, Bill can confirm that it indeed was a 11/23, the same =
racks were used for Datakit switches. He also remembered that the =
software for this PDP-11 went by the nickname of =E2=80=9CTPC=E2=80=9D - =
for Tiny Phone Company. Lee McMahon was on the team writing TPC.

The first software for the Datakit switch was written by Greg Chesson =
and was called =E2=80=9CCMC=E2=80=9D (for =E2=80=98Common Control=E2=80=99=
). There are still some references to CMC in the 8th Edition source =
code.

This first software was later replaced by new code designed by Lee =
McMahon that was modelled after TPC. This new code was named =E2=80=9CTDK=E2=
=80=9D. This, too, can be seen in the 8th Edition source. The TDK =
protocols for building and releasing a Datakit virtual circuit appear to =
have been in use into the 1990=E2=80=99s.
