I was referring to the fact that arrays sometimes are types and sometimes
dissolve into pointers to their first elements.    It's a kludgy concept.
Assignment of array objects or passing/returning them should have been
really implemented at the same time sturct passing/return/assignment was
done.
The fact that a function that appears to pass/take array arguments magically
converts to pointers is kludgy.

That is my vague recollection too.

Which aspect? The ability to assign/pass/return arrays, or the funky way
that array naming worked (I'm trying to remember the details, I think it was
something to do with 'arrays' passed as arguments - it was actually a
pointer that was passed, but the declaration didn't have to say 'pointer').
