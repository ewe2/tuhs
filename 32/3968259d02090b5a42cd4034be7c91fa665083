My understanding is that it's been 1st Jan 1970 since at least Ed5, if not 
Ed6.

The only systems I have that would care would be the various computers, 
and they are all NTP-synced (except the NBN modem/router takes its time 
from T$).

Well, I don't care about the M$ epoch, and at 86 I might even get to see 
the world come to a grinding halt :-)  Of course, I may be reliant upon M$ 
systems in hospitals etc...

Interesting story about the S/360 though.  As a side-issue I wonder how 
many COBOL programmers will still be around to maintain all that payroll 
software etc?
