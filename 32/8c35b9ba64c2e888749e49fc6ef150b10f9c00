This is something that has bugged me forever.

The Unix design is simple and elegant. The manuals are lucid and
understandable. However, there is next to no commenting in the
early code bases. Why? [and I know ken is reading this]

Given that the comments never made it into the compiled code, there
was no space reason to omit comments. There must have been another
reason.

Cheers, Warren
