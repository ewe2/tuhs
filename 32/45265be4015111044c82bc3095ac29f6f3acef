Subject: [pups] Mini UNIX (V6) and V7 tapes found
Message-ID: <7AD18F04B62B7440BE22E190A3F7721409E4EF@mwsrv04.microwalt.nl>

Hi all,

Looks liek I ran into a bunchof really old and useful tapes
here.  Two tapes come from Bell Labs, and seem to contain the
official Mini UNIX (Sixth Edition) and the official UNIX,
Seventh Edition.

Dennis (dmr): can you verify that Bell wrote these on magtapes
from Graham Magnetics, with blue inside label?  All the stickers
and such seem "real".  The V7 tape is dated 10/15/79, the V7 one
is from 1977.

Images available on request.. still wanna know if these are real
ones, or locally-modified ones.

Cheers,
	Fred
