Subject: [TUHS] Retro UNIX 8086 / 80386
Message-ID: <0F0B9BFC06289346B88512B91E55670D2FEC@EXCHANGE>

I stumbled onto this by accident, and yes it really is a port of UNIX v1
from PDP-11 assembly into 8086/80386 assembly.

I fired up Qemu and some of the disk images and it booted up!

the directories contain assembly, text files, pdf's, images, and pictures...
I have no idea how to build it I didn't see any make file, but it looks very
interesting!

Also you may want to mute the tab, or turn your speakers down, it has an
embedded music player.
