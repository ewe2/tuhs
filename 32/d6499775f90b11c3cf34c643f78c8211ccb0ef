12.5 doesn't run on 645's, you need a 6180 / DPS-8, which is not as well
documented.

http://orangesquid.net/projects/ge635/ is the start of one.

lots of docs at bitsavers.org/pdf/honeywell under multics, dps-8 and series6000
to give you an idea of the size of the project.

OT.. is Jim Lowe still at La Crosse? If so, say hi for me..
