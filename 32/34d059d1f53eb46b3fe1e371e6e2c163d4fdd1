Well, in the shameless department, I can quote from my book:

	Mucking up the ecosystem into which you release code does not
	add value. Many developers behave as if they’re stereotypical
	Americans vacationing in another country, or for that matter my
	father-in-law visiting — the “I just came to your place, so do
	things my way” attitude.

	For example, UNIX systems have a command that displays manual pages
	for programs. You can type man foo and it’ll show you the page
	for the foo command. There’s also a convention that really complex
	commands, such as yacc , have both a manual page and a longer, more
	in-depth document that describes the program in more detail. When
	the GNU project (which I’ll discuss shortly) added commands to
	UNIX, it used its own texinfo system for manuals, which wasn’t
	compatible with the man system. The result was that users would have
	to try both the man and info commands to find documentation. Even
	if, as some believe, the GNU approach was superior, any possible
	benefits were outweighed by the UNIX community’s huge loss of
	productivity that resulted from the fragmented ecosystem.
