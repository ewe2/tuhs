Subject: [TUHS] 4.4BSD installed image or login shell?
Message-ID: <alpine.NEB.2.01.1204181601420.7466@t1.m.reedmedia.net>

Does anyone have installation instructions (with binary distribution) or 
a ready-to-use image for an historical 4.4BSD (encumbered or -Lite plus 
needed parts or -Lite2) with gxemul, tme, or other emulator?

Or any login shell available?

(For my tests, I want to use the real thing instead of a *BSD from the 
time of the 4.4BSD-lite merge.)

Thanks
