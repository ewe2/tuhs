That used to be a boon, but these days I've often found the Debian man
page to be little more than --help output, done to close a bug against
the package and worse than nothing because its existence stops anyone
else having a go, including upstream as their program becomes more
mature.

IIRC ESR is saying RMS has agreed info format is dead and is trying to
get agreement from him where to go from there, but that's been the case
for a couple of years.
