I have my opinions about SCO, and what they're doing.  I don't think 
we'll see any problems because this activity is down in the noise.  They 
need to challenge Linux at the enterprise level.  It will be quite some 
time, if ever, that 32V reaches that level of complexity in order to be 
a threat.

For now, it's an exercise in nostalgia.  In 1980, a friend and I 
investigated licensing unix for sale on 68K and 8086 based computers. 
We couldn't raise the $68,000 source+binary license fee, so the project 
died.  That was more than double my salary as an engineer at that time.

Now, 23 years later, I'm going to do a port to see how close my original 
estimates are to reality.  After the initial port, who knows?
