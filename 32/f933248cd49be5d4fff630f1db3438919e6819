Subject: [TUHS] the V distributed system
Message-ID: <200804092105.54738.wes.parish@paradise.net.nz>

I was researching various windowing systems for various reasons and I found 
the mention of the V distributed sytem on the W article stub on Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_Window_System
"W was originally developed at Stanford University by Paul Asente and Brian 
Reid for the V operating system."

A few questions here: is V close enough to Unix to warrant winding up in 
an "Other" category in the TUHS repository?  Does anyone have a copy of it 
(plus source if possible)?  If so, who should I contact?

Thanks

Wesley Parish
