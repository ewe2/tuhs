I searched and found, very very interesting.  Zuse's statement that the Colossus team and himself had been going down similar paths sounds very much like Leibnitz and Newton over Calculus :-)

About 10 years ago I went into the National Air and Space museum in Washington and they had a wind from a Henschel guided missile from World War 2.  They stated that it was built using some of the first computer controlled plant and I always wondered what it was, well now I know.

Again, this is very interesting and I am astounded that it isn't widely known or advertised.
