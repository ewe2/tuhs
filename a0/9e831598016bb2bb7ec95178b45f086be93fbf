I missed some. It also wants quest1, quest2 and quest5 (and maybe more).
This may present a bit of a problem, as I can't find any trace of them
anywhere, and will have to work out from the source what their arguments,
etc are, what they do, etc.

I wonder how on earth the 2.11 people got this to assemble? (Or maybe they
didn't?)
