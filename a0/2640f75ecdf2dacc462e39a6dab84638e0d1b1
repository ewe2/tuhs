Subject: [TUHS] DG/UX 4 tape images ... are incoming!
Message-ID: <20050906201226.GA3594@freaknet.org>


We're succesfully dumping the DG/UX tapes we have here. :)

we had a lot of problem due to "Sticky shed syndrome": the
tape stick to the head, causing the tape to lock while
reading data ...

cooking tapes will be a solution, but we followed another
idea: we used a special Teflon Lubricant Spray (here in
italy is "CRC TEFLON PENLUB SPRAY"

this is PERFECT for tapes - we had to rewind the tape 
spraying the lubricant on the tape. this cause no 
problems at all, and we red sticky tapes without 
problems!

the tape images are here:

i don't know if there is (C) on those tapes - and really, i
don't care about it. I think preserving them is a MISSION for
us, and, so, here are the images.

happy hacking! :)
