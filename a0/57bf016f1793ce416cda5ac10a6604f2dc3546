A quick try with bochs bails out on me, but at least reveals the 
version:

     COHERENT Tertiary boot Version 1.2.7
     If installing COHERENT, please type "begin".
     ? begin
     Loading COHERENT.
     -
     Loading COHERENT data.

     *** COHERENT Version 4.2.10 - 386 Mode.  5712KB free memory. ***
     Color.  NDP=387.  2528 buffers.  2521 buckets.  64 clists.
     256KB kalloc pool.  0 KB phys pool.

     PANIC : fsminit: no rootdev(4,15)
     Call backtrace:  -> ffc28142 -> ffc19129 -> ffc002b6

If you want to run COHERENT in a VM this is mandatory reading.
