sendmail was really a different code base from delivermail.  As Eric
(Allman) used to say, the later was created to solve the "header of the
week" issue he was fighting at the time.

At one point there was an smtpd that was written by BBN.   I don't remember
why Eric did not continue to use it when he wrote sendmail.    At Berkeley
at the time, the only system that needed it was Ing70 later IngVax [which
of course Eric managed] because that was the Internet connection for the
systems on campus.   We all ran the BerkNet to the ingress systems for
Internet mail or to ernie (later ucbvax) to do UUCP mail.

He and I talked about about it once, I had always wished he had left the
different "connector" programs alone and just let sendmail be a header
rewriting system.

uucp just handed off to /bin/mail for delivery.  I thought delivermail did
the same thing. I think it was Kurt Shoens who did the splicing of Berkeley
delivermail to uucp, but again I've forgotten - a long time ago.  The SCCS
headers might say.  memory was that Kurt and Eric Schmidt
