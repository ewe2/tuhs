Subject: [TUHS]  4.1cBSD Anyone?
Message-ID: <621112A569DAE948AD25CCDCF1C075331AB5DA@dolly.ntdom.cupdx>

Hi all!
   Just curious, has anyone here managed to get 4.1cBSD (or any 4.1 for that matter) running under SIMH or any other hardware or software?
   How does one prepare a SIMH-format distribution tape from a collection of files?  I haven't found a whole lot of information on the subject, and I imagine it'd be fairly difficult to make a root dump without a pre-existing system...

Many thanks to all in advance!
