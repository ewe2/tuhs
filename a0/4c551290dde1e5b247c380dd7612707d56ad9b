If someone gives me a pointer to the tarballs I'll happily import
them into BitKeeper and set up a 32vi.bkbits.net that anyone can use.
Unlike sourceforge, we're about quality, not quantity, but even so,
we have 1/3 as many files under revision control and no performance
problems.  It's not really sourceforge's fault, they choose CVS and CVS
sucks.  As Ted T'so said recently "CVS is not the answer, CVS is the
question.  No is the answer."  :)
