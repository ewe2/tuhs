Yes.

Most likely no. The Sequent Symmetry machines had only one thing in
common with a PeeCee: The Intel 80386DX chip. Everything else was custom
Sequent architecture. 

And by the way: I have hands on experience with a 8 CPU Sequent Symmetry
S27. It cost over 900000 DM (today about 500000 US$) in 1989 and had a
much slower disk and network interface as the Sun 3/260. It was an
overpriced snail.
