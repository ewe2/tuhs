Re-subject'd as this part of the conversation diverges.

Found the quote that I was thinking of when I said that:

https://yarchive.net/comp/bsd.html

"Research Unix 8th Edition started from (I think) BSD 4.1c, but with enormo=
us amounts scooped out and replaced by our own stuff." - Dennis Ritchie

The "I think" adds some murkiness for sure.  There's definitely a good chun=
k of code from 4BSD.  Compare init, getty, locore.c (as opposed to .s in V7=
 back).  Heck, even the main.c between the two kernels are more similar to =
each other than V7.  I would almost opt towards calling that being rebased =
on 4BSD rather than V7 with bits and pieces of BSD added.  I could see it b=
eing more beneficial to start with 4BSD and tack on necessary Bell bits rat=
her than take V7/32V and try and shoehorn in the VM implementation for VAX.

The 4.1cBSD copy on the archive does appear to be pretty different, so in t=
erms of raw comparison, I suspect the basis is 4BSD rather than 4.1cBSD.  I=
 don't know that we have a clean copy of 4.1BSD gold, I'd be interested to =
see if the structure of the source code changed between 4.1 and 4.1c, as 4.=
1c does exhibit the new organization by the BSD folks, 4BSD still shows fol=
ders like cmd, lib, and so on.

Not trying to be combative by any means, but I've been doing a bit of resea=
rch lately into when V8 was snapped from BSD and where Bell and Berkeley th=
en diverged from that last major confluence, especially with a focus on ini=
t and other early stages of userland.
