Hhmmm... I recall using DEC's C compiler, which we called VAX C.
Calling C stuff from VAX FORTRAN required jiggery-pokery and the other
way was hopeless.  I recall (assuming no wetware bit-rot on my part)
that DEC's languages did not pass on the stack but stuffed the
arguments somewhere, passing a pointer to the somewhere.
