[I originally asked the following on Twitter which was probably not the =
smartest idea]

I was recently wondering about the origins of Linux, i.e. Linux Torvalds =
doing his MSc and deciding to write Linux (the kernel) for the i386 =
because Minix did not support the i386 properly. While this is perfectly =
understandable I was trying to understand why, as he was in academia, he =
did not decide to write a =E2=80=9Cfree X=E2=80=9D for a different X. =
The example I picked was Plan 9, simply because I always liked it but X =
could be any number of other operating systems which he would have been =
exposed to in academia. This all started in my mind because I was =
thinking about my friends who were CompSci university students with me =
at the time and they were into all sorts of esoteric stuff like =
Miranda-based operating systems, building a complete interface builder =
for X11 on SunOS including sparkly mouse pointers, etc. (I guess you =
could define it as =E2=80=9Cthe usual frivolous MSc projects=E2=80=9D) =
and comparing their choices with Linus=E2=80=99.

The answers I got varied from =E2=80=9Cthe world needed a free Unix and =
BSD was embroiled in the AT&T lawsuit at the time=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9CPla=
n 9 also had a restrictive license=E2=80=9D (to the latter my response =
was that =E2=80=9Cso did Unix and that=E2=80=99s why Linus built =
Linux!=E2=80=9D) but I don=E2=80=99t feel any of the answers addressed =
my underlying question as to what was wrong in the exposure to other =
operating systems which made Unix the choice?

Personally I feel that if we had a distributed OS now instead of Linux =
we=E2=80=99d be better off with the current architecture of the world so =
I am sad that "Linux is not Plan 9" which is what prompted the question.

Obviously I am most grateful for being able to boot the Mathematics =
department=E2=80=99s MS-DOS i486 machines with Linux 0.12 floppy disks =
and not having to code Fortran 77 in Notepad followed by eventually =
taking over the department with X-Terminals based on Linux connected to =
the departmental servers (Sun, DEC Alpha, IBM RS/6000s). Without Linux =
they had been running eXeed (sp?) on Windows 3.11! In this respect Linux =
definitely filled in a huge gap.
