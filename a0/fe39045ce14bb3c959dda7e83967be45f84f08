A version of email was included in the original DARPA version of the 
internet.  This was early 1970s.  In fact, when we played with and 
evaluated it at Lawrence Berkeley Lab, our report noted that the 
internet would probably not be very useful for exchanging scientific 
files (as had been the original purpose).  However, we did note that 
email might become very useful.   ;-)
