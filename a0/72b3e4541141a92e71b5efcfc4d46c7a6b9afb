Subject: [TUHS] TUHS Mail Server: upcoming change
Message-ID: <20151209082540.GA4670@www.oztivo.net>

All, in the next few days I'm migrating minnie.tuhs.org from one VM to
another, so as to upgrade the OS and clean out the system. I think I've
got the mail subsystem up and running, but as usual there may be bugs.

I'll send out another message when the system is cut over. If things
don't seem to be right, e-mail me at:

	wkt at tuhs.org, or
	warren.toomey at tafe.qld.edu.au    if the tuhs.org one fails.

Cheers all, Warren
