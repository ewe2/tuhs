There is a Henry Spencer <henry at spsystems.net>, who about a year ago
or so posted to the IETF TLS list and posted to comp.compilers a
decade ago.  When I saw the name, I wondered if it was Henry at zoo but I
did not enquire.  I never met Henry, despite walking past Zoo almost
daily when I was a grad student.  As such, any email from an unknown
like me may be discarded.
