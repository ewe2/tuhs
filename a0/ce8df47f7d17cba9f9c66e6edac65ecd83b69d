Subject: PDP-11 Processor features/options (was HELP PDP-11 instruction)
Message-ID: <200005102323.JAA29607@psychwarp.psych.usyd.edu.au>


I have updated my web page, fixing a few typos, and made more distinctions
between various processors, along with a table of 'obscure instructions'.

	http://www.psych.usyd.edu.au/pdp-11/table.html

Does anyone out there know the internal implementation details of the J11
chip. I assume it's micro sequenced, but what is the micro word length?


PS

I have found the 'PDP-11 Family Differences Table' (in the PDP-11 Architecture
Handbook and others) to be wrong in several places.

Actually, the first HSCs (HSC-50 and HSC-70) have an F11. Hmmm, a bit
unsure about the HSC-70 come to think of it. The HSC-50 is definitely F-11
anyway, and that's the oldest one. Boots of DECtape II. Slow as hell
because of it. :-)

What cpu is in the DEUNA and DEQNA? I think those also have a T11.

And I think DEC even supported the possibility of writing your own
microcode for this one.

The MED instruction is used in RT-11 to determine if the machine is an
11/60.  It's probably also used in the 11/60-specific XXDP diagnostics.
I don't think that it's used in any of the -11 Unices.

Note that MED is really a two-word-long instruction.

>ldub 170003

My 11/60 Processor Handbook also lists MNS (170004), MNP (170005), and
MAS (170006).  These are "11/60 FP11-E Maintenance Instructions" and
"This set together with the LDUB instruction should be used for diagnostic
purposes only" according to the 11/60 book.

Note that no version of DEC MACRO-11 recognizes MNS, MNP, MAS, or LDUB.

The MED instruction is recognized in MACRO-11 only as MED6X.  The "6X"
jibes with the rumored existence of experimental variants on the 11/60
processor, one of which is the multi-processor 11/64.

I thought DEUNA was 68k and DEQNA is definatly state machines and random
logic no t11.  DELQA is 68k.

Yes there was a WCS that filled the FIS microm spot (and a full board
under it).
