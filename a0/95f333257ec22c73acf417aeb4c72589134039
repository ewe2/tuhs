Subject: [TUHS] TUHS] why does tar have the tape device hard coded into
 it and why is it mt1 instead of mt0
Message-ID: <201512121717.tBCHHm5W064050@tahoe.cs.Dartmouth.EDU>

Forget that I said, "I think that tar was written by Chuck Haley or Greg Chesson".
Ken confirms that he wrote it, for dectape.
