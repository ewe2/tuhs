I am reasonably sure that they weren't in MACLISP (SETF is there) and fairly sure also they were not in InterLisp.  They do appear in Lisp Machine Lisp, so I would suspect that this was how they found their way into CL.

However as soon as macros appeared (sometime shortly after Lisp 1.5 I think) things like this become so easy to implement (in the usual cases at least: fully-fledged ones are harder until SETF and its machinery exists, although that itself can be implemented with macrology) that probably they appeared many times in programs informally before this without anyone bothering to document them.
