  I do not remember ever using, much less
  needed to refer to, the character "back slash" until the unfortunate crap
  that the folks in Redmond forced on the industry.

Oh, come on.  You programmed in C.  You probably used
UNIX back when @ was the default kill character (though
I doubt you're odd enough still to use that kill character,
as I do).  You surely used troff, LaTeX, or both, and have
doubtless sworn at regular expressions more often than
most of the young Linux crowd have had chocolate bars.

I think you've just forgotten it out of PBSD (post-backlash
stress disorder, nothing to do with Berkeley).
