I have a similar and maybe even more extreme position.  When I was a manager
I placed restrictions on the tools and customizations for members of my team.
My goal was to make sure that any team member could go over to any other team
member's desk and get stuff done.  I strongly pushed vi as an editor because
it was "standard"; as Clem said every emacs seemed to be different.  I prohibited
the redefinition of the vi key bindings and also any shell aliases that replaced
standard commands.  Nothing worse for productivity than going to help out a
colleague and then discovering that they the redefined "ls" as "rm"!
