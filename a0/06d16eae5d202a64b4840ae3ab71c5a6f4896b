Subject: [TUHS] C reference manual
Message-ID: <20021016210940.K3711@chiark.greenend.org.uk>

I'm looking for a copy of the C reference manual from some time
between the 6th Edition (1975) and the first version that came
with 4.3BSD (1986). The stuff in the TUHS archive mostly seems to
be missing the documentation sets, or in the case of the earlier
BSDs they are ommitted for copyright reasons. There are some
tutorials dating from about 1979 but they aren't much use.

Any help would be appreciated.

Tony.
