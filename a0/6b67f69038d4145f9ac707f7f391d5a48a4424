I had always thought that also until Pressotto pointed out the Lesk had
used it for UUCP which was running around Bell before Seventh Edition.  But
... given Bill talked about it for shell in his comments, as Warner points
out, that would have been before UUCP arrived at UCB -- so I don't think it
was from Lesk unless someone like Ken had mentioned it, or he knew about it
from another source (such as MTS from which Joy had learned/used as an
undergrad before UNIX).

As you said, Bill had an ADM3A at home (I had an H19 in those days), but as
you knew too well, there were a ton of different terminals at UCB --
whichever was cheapest usually had a run of popularity :-)  So the thought
HOME keycap = home directory also is quite possible.

Of course, Mike and Bill certainly could have come up with it
independently but to me, it seems like the chance of both using the same
char is really unlikely.   IIRC a tilde keycap was on the ASR-37 keyboard
but frankly, I don't remember, and can't find a pic of the keyboard detail,
plus the LCM+L is closed right now for CV-19 reasons so it's hard to check.
