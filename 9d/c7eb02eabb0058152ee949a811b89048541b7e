I might be colored by the fact that I'm running Linux myself, but I'd
say that those are almost certainly worth preserving somehow,
somewhere. Linux and OS X are the Unix-like systems people are most
likely to come in contact with these days, and preserving their
history seems worthwhile. Linux' is probably easier than that of OS X
at least outside of Apple.

That said, at least the 0.99 series _does_ seem to be available on
kernel.org: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/v0.99/
has what looks like every version from 0.99 proper to 0.99.15. I'm not
finding 0.98 anywhere, though, nor anything like 1.0pl14 (but I do
notice a patchset to 1.0pl15 in the kernel/v1.0 directory). There are
also 0.0x and 0.1x versions there under kernel/Historic{,/old-versions}.
So it's definitely a mixed bag.

I would suggest contacting the kernel.org folks and ask if they are
interested in receiving the versions you have. You just might have
found a little historical treasure trove of early Linux development.
