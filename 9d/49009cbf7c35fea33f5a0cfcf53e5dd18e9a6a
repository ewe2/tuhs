That's right. This is for BIO_ZONE stuff, which has to do with host managed
and host aware SMR drive zones. That's different than the zones you are
talking about.

Yes. This matches our experience where we get 1.5x better on the low LBAs
than the high LBAs. We're looking to 'short stroke' the drive to the first
part of it to get better performance... Toss a filesystem on top of it, and
have a more random workload and it's down to about 30% better than using
the whole drive....
