Huh?  First of all, Sun employees don't have a contract, they are (or were)
at will employees.  So I think you mean they would quit if it were BSD
licensed.

Second, I've _never_ heard a single Sun person say they would quit if Sun
open sourced something under the BSD license.  I'm sure I've heard someone
say they didn't like that license but never heard anyone giving up their
job over it.
