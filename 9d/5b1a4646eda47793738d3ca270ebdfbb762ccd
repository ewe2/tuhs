I'll remind you all of a story I'm sure I shared here in the past.  

I was friends with the 3 Cygnus founders and I was having a dinner
with them at Gumby's house.  (This is an aside but it is important:
Gumby was, at that time, married to a very nice German woman named
Silka; she still had a pretty strong accent, English was not her
first language).  

Cygnus was pretty much a 100% GPL / LGPL shop.  So the discussions
were all "RMS this", "RMS that" and went on for a long time (hours).

Silka was clearing the table and she pipes up with "Are you saying
'RMS this'?"  We say yes, and she responds with "Huh, all this time I
heard 'Our mess this', 'Our mess that'".  We all looked at each other
in silence, sort of replaying everying through that view.  And started
laughing (and freaking out a little) that every sentence made sense as
"Our mess <whatever>".

I'm clearly not a fan of RMS, yeah, he did some good but in the process
he took credit for an enormous body of work in which he didn't write a
line of code.  As a programmer, that's lieing and I can't stand liars.

And that's all I have to say on the RMS topic, it's probably too much
as it is.
