I don't know if it was purposeful or not, but Algol 68 had the notion
of deproceduring - i.e. function call, which seems to have carried over
into C where the name of function is a pointer to it. You can do

	void myproc();
	void (*functptr) = myproc;
	...
	funcptr()

to call through the pointer.  (Even though the K&R book taught us
to use (*funcptr)(), the syntax above worked at least as far back
as PCC.)

Did C pick this up from Algol 68? I have no idea, but it would not
surprise me if it had.
