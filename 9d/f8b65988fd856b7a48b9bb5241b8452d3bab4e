In '93 or '94 I responded to an advertisement by
Temple University (Philadelphia) that they were
giving away for free - U haul - a working 3B20S
system. Figuring it was simply a slightly bigger 
brother of the 3B2, I arranged to pick it up and
drove out there. 

Imagine my dismay when I discovered it to consist
of four refrigerator-sized cabinets, several
washing-machine disk units, and boxes of spare
parts. Alas, no way that was all going to fit
in my little apartment, not to mention the power
requirements, so I had to turn it down. I hope
they eventually found a good home for it..
