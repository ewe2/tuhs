They are now in four subdirectories at
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/

Here is an (incomplete, I'm sure) list of people who have been involved
with the lobbying for the release of these editions of Unix:

Dennis Ritchie
Ken Thompson
Doug McIlroy
Brian Kernighan
Rob Pike
Russ Cox
Norman Wilson
Peter Salus
Martin Carroll

Martin in particular, through his persistance, finally got the legal
bods at Alcatel-Lucent to agree to not assert their copyright rights.

Cheers, Warren

P.S All I did was nag people and set up a mailing list for them :)
