Welcome!  I hope that you're not leaving the list because of the sudden 
volume; it's normally quiet, but we are a bunch of old farts who will 
sometimes get too much mint in our juleps, and we are all too happy to 
pass on what we know (mostly because we've been there, and have seen the 
present as well).

Please don't leave, if you are...
