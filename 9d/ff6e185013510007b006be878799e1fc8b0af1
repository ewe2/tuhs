Does anyone know anything about this? What I *think* it was was  
something that ran on a logic analyser (?) made by Tektronix, which  
had some kind of PDP-11 inside them.  I suspect it was actually 7th  
edition or something similar in rather light disguise.  I came across  
one of these in the early 80s but never used it, hence the vagueness  
of my memory.
