That's exactly what you expect when ^H is not magic: it is echoed back to
/dev/tty like any other normal character, and your emulator does what ^H
means per X3.4: it backs up the cursor by 1 column.

But by adding stty erase ^H, it then 'works' the same as in v6. Seth's

A nice hack in stty (though I am not sure how far back it goes): you can
enter ^H either with an actual backspace character or with the
two-character sequence ^ followed by h or H.  The second form has the
advantage that it can be typed correctly no matter how badly you have
screwed up your control characters.

Oh, the mysteries of terminal interaction.

and
you'll know all about how terminal emulators behave.  It isn't hard to
read, once you have learned to read "00/13" as hex 0D, which everyone knows
right off is CR.  (If not, <asciitable.com> is your friend.)  The reason
for this bizarre row/column notation is so that escape sequences are always
binary no matter the encoding: the sequence that introduces multi-character
control sequences is usually spoken of as "ESC [", but technically it has
to be sent to a conforming terminal as "\x1B\x45" even if the encoding is
EBCDIC, where "ESC [" would be "\x27\xBA" (at least in the US/Canada flavor
of EBCDIC).

Bugs are another matter, of course.
