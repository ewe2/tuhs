In the late 1970s I had a summer job which involved writing FORTRAN 
programs to analyse card decks.  This was on some IBM machine, which had a 
combi card punch/reader.  On one run the program loaded and compiled, and 
the first two data cards went through.  Then the machine crashed.

After a bit of head-scratching, I realised that it was because the punch 
station came immediately before the read station, and there was a small 
typo in the program.  It processed the first data card, but rather than 
logging to the printer it overpunched the second card instead resulting in 
an invalid hole combination.  That card then went into the read station, 
and the machine didn't like it...
