It depends how widely spread the source code was and how may people
still have readable 15 year old backups.  I know I tend to delete old
code after a while and many of my old QIC-150 tapes are no longer
readable.

I'd be very surprised if this produces anything useful.  The code will
have been compiled with a reasonable degree of optimisation and won't
have any debugging symbols in it.  It would be reasonably trivial to
turn it into something that a C compiler could understand but making
it look anything like the original is a major undertaking.
