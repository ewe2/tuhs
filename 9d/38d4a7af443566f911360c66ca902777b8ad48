Ahem. This is not a new idea. Take a hard look at Plan 9 From Bell Labs,
where the original Unix guys decided that it was worth starting over.
They did A LOT of neat stuff.

There's a lot of overlap of readership between TUHS and 9fans (not
suprising); I'm suprised noone beat me to mentioning this.

But before totally reinventing the wheel, I'd strongly recommend looking
at what Ken et al did with Plan 9.
