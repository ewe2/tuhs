I assume you mean under the name "PWB". I stand corrected.  At Southern
Bell I'm pretty sure the doc did not use that name though.  However, it's
been close to 40 years and I don't feel like digging out the manuals
to check. :-)

Thanks,

Arnold

If I recall the argument in USG was many of the BSD tools were not better or even as good as what USG had already created.  But the USG folks did eventually add some of them to their stream because so many internal sites were already using them.  In particular, v, csh and col -- but there were others too and the argument was we have those tools covered already i.e. pg vs. more or se vs. vi
