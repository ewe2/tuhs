Got you on that. I succeeded on running SysIII for PDP 11 on SIMH on 2008.

I think I left a note here, but just in case, I kept all the instruction on
how to do it. BTW, there is another, similar road described in betaarchive.co.uk
forums for SysIII on Vax on SIMH.

I can post the details if there is any interest. I used to host the virtual
machine on my FTP server until one of its subsidiary NFS servers went toast
on a heat pick in our computer room (sic). I'll restore the server contents
ASAP to make it all available again.
