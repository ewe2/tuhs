I saw this *a lot* when I worked at Intel; being forced to use
the wrong tools for software development because of political
considerations instead of technical ones.  One of the reasons I
was super glad to leave there and why I think that Intel as a
whole will never make it as a software company. (There are pockets
there that understand software, but the majority of the company
does not.)

Sorry,
