Beginning with the Eighth Edition, ed(1) had the following command.
This is from the Plan 9 ed man page.

          (.,.)b[+-][pagesize][pln]
               Browse.  Print a `page', normally 20 lines.  The
               optional `+' (default) or `-' specifies whether the
               next or previous page is to be printed.  The optional
               pagesize is the number of lines in a page.  The
               optional `p', `n', or `l' causes printing in the speci-
               fied format, initially `p'.  Pagesize and format are
               remembered between `b' commands.  Dot is left at the
               last line displayed.

In 1983 I added it to my Seventh Edition source to ed and kicked the
vi habit.  I used it unil Sam(1) and now use Acme(1) almost exclusively.
