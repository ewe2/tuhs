With regard to programming languages at UCB in 1980 ...

I'd done something of a survey of colleges, and in my mind at the time, there =
were two approaches to a CS degree: mostly or entirely theoretical (those CS =
departments that had grown out of Mathematics tended to have this focus), or =
more practical tools/techniques/operational theory (those CS departments that =
had grown out of Engineering tended to be this way). UCB was definitely the =
latter, and that's what I wanted.

I got to UCB in fall 1980, admitted to the College of Letters & Science. =
At the time, there were two ways to get intro to programming:

CS1 - FORTRAN IV, taught on the CDC 6400 running CalidoSCOPE in batch mode =
with real punch cards, punched up on IBM 029 keypunch machines.

CS3 - Pascal, as Clem described.

CS1 was for engineers & scientists, CS3 for students who wanted to get into =
the CS degree program in L&S. You could take CS1 in lieu of CS3, but that was =
frowned upon.

Two paths to a computer science degree: A.B. CS from L&S, or B.S. EECS from =
the College of Engineering (which you had to be explicitly admitted to before =
you got there).

There was a basic difference in emphasis between L&S and Engineering for CS: =
L&S was "software with a smattering of hardware" (cf. CS-150, CS-152), and =
Engineering's EECS (B.S.) degree was the inverse: "hardware with a smattering =
of software."

L&S was the largest "college" at UCB: everyone got into that one "undeclared", =
and for your freshman & sophmore years, you studied to accumulate course =
credits towards declaring a major once you had "sophmore standing" (however, =
if you were prudent, you accumulated credits towards a "backup" major if the =
undergraduate degree program you wanted wouldn't/couldn't let you in). If you =
couldn't declare major at sophmore standing, you were bounced out of the =
university. Some of this setup was hangover from anti-student radical policies =
from the 1960s: prevent "students" from hanging around the university forever =
(and fomenting).

The "weeder" course for L&S CS was CS40: more Pascal than you'd ever want to =
code in a lifetime. L&S CS needed that filter: just before I got there, they'd =
let anyone into the program, but in 1980 or 1981, they limited the class size =
to 200 undergrads because there was too much demand from students for that =
degree program for the department to handle - didn't make the cut? I hope you =
have a backup major ...

They didn't formally teach C to undergrads until "upper division" (declared =
major in CS, junior or senior standing), and IIRC, there wasn't a formal course =
in it - you were expected to pick it up as part of the upper division course =
in operating systems. After all, you already know Pascal and Assembly, right?

Of course, once you had an account on one of the PDP-11/70s running Unix, C =
and shell programming was entirely available to you, so I went for what =
amounted to self-directed learning (reading manuals & books) as fast as I =
could.
