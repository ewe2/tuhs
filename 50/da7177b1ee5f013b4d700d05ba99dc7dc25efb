And there's another issue: *which* PDP11?  I have a MINC-11 that was 
upgraded with an 11/23 CPU, as many were.  I managed to get my hands on 
the original MINC software, and it would not run.  It's been a while 
since I did that so I don't remember the exact instruction on which it 
choked (with an illegal instruction trap).  But I dropped in an 11/03 
CPU and all ran fine.  I found a helpful matrix in one of the DEC 
handbooks that outlines just which instructions were changed between 
several of the Qbus processors, anyway. 

Imagine the number of compiler switches....  -- Ian
