Trn and tin should both be reasonable.  I think trn4 and tin may be a
bit past the mid 80's.
I seem to remember tin was in the early 1990s (wikipedia says 1991) and
trn was probably just a little earlier.

Rn was pretty much the standard newsreader in the old days when we still
did news via serial port.
Trn will build on newer machines and does run in rn mode.
