Yeah, to be fair, by the time Solaris 2.3 or 2.4 came around, it was
mostly up to par.  (Or maybe it was because Moore's law meant that we
didn't care any more.  :-)

Sure, but there's no *point* to sunset the old tools.  The git tree
for net-tools is still being actively developed (the last commit was
dated December 12, 2021).  And the kernel interfaces are not going to
be disappear, because of the prime directive: Thou Shalt Not Break
Userspace.

Well, take a look at the ip-route man page.  The BSD route command
assumes fundamentally there is a single routing table that you can
update.  In Linux, there are multiple routing tables --- to support
NAT, VRF (virtual routing and forwarding), etc.

I suspect the other consideration was that all of this extra
functionality and complexity were done by folks who wanted the Linux
networking stack to essentially have pretty much all of the
functionality of a Cisco Router.  So it made sense to create a new
user interface interface that was inspired by the Cisco IOS
configuration language.  Now, if you weren't trying to do something
ala a router in the default-free zone, and were just simply doing what
most leaf nodes on the internet (99.99999% of the hosts), there really
is no reason to need to use the ip/ss interface.  For that matter, you
probably don't need to use ifconfig/route --- just let the DHCP client
server of your choice take care of setting up the network, and you're
done.

That's a distro-level choice.  And for most users, their networking is
automatically brought up using NetworkManager, or some such, so they
probably don't care.  And it's not like installing a package is that
painful.  I don't see users of say, mysql complaining that they have
to install that package should they want to use it.

I'm old school, and since I generally tend to install BIND, that will
drag in net-tools as dependency, so all my systems have ifconfig
installed.  But I'm not going to have a lot of sympathy for someone
who thinks that "sudo apt-get install net-tools" is massive
inconvenience.
