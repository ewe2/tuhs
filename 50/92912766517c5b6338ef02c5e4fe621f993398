Never got to use the V7 shell; we were stuck with 11/40s[*] :-(  It was 
certainly in the V6 shell, hence by bafflement at why labels were of the 
form ": blah" instead of the sensible "blah: "...

Although I did shove as much of the V7 kernel into V6 as I could (such as 
XON/XOFF), thereby earning me the sobriquet "Mr Unix 6.5" or something; 
having the AUSAM buffer scheme helped a lot.
