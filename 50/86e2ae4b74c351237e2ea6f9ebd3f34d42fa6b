// had a very different meaning in IBM JCL.  It's a sequence
indicating that a command follows, and I have a suspicion that it's
related to a prompt.  In JCL (on punched cards) you had to punch it
with the rest, but interactive programs printed it for you, usually a
single character.  UNIVAC OS/1100 used @, and OMEGA used #, for
example.

Does anybody else have input?
