Needed to tell someone, so I thought I would tell all of you!

My PDP11/73 now has BSD2.11 installed and working.  I added a DEQNA card,
rebuilt the kernel and now ping, telnet, ftp et al is working.

The joy of telneting into my '11 from a Windoze machine is beyond words!

Many thanks to Warren, Fred and Joe for all the help and advice.

Regards


Kevin
