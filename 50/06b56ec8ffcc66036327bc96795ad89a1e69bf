I would disagree with this assessment.  NT's VMS heritage has already
been discussed.  I do not know the heritage of OS/2 but to call it DOS
is simply not true.  (Among other things, OS/2 did an excellent job of
virtualizing dosboxes. We were developing PCMCIA drivers with OS/2 in
dosboxes.  When one crashed, you simply opened up another and
continued.)
