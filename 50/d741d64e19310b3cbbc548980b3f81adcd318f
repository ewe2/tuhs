I always thought it was undefined, but my Mac says:

BUGS
     Applying fstat to a socket (and thus to a pipe) returns a zero'd buffer,
     except for the blocksize field, and a unique device and inode number.

And my FreeBSD box is the same; I haven't checked my Penguins.

Probably not much use to you, but back in Ed6 I did modify it to return
the amount of data in the pipe.
