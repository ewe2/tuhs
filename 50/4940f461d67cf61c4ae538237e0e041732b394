3 sync's was net.wisdom for a long time, but some discussions in the
Linux mailing lists suggested that 2 was enough all along.

The first schedules all dirty buffers to be flushed to disk.

The second does the same, but to provide an ordering guarantee,
doesn't return until the dirty buffers from the first are finished.

Hence the 2.

But I'm a relative newcomer to *ix - I didn't get involved until SunOS 4.
