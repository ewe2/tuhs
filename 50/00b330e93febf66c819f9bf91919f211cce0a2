Subject: [TUHS] Unix with TCP/IP for small PDP-11s
Message-ID: <20170519151518.8800D18C09D@mercury.lcs.mit.edu>

I'm trying to find out if there is any existing Unix for the PDP-11
which supports TCP/IP on /40-/34-23 class machines (i.e. non-I+D
machines)?

Does 2.9 BSD with TCP/IP (assuming such a thing exists) fit on those
machines? (I know 2.9 does run on them, but I don't know about the TCP/IP
part.)


The reason I ask is that MIT did a TCP/IP for V6 which would run on them
(only incoming packet de-mux is in the kernel - the TCP is in with the
application, in the user process), which has recently been recovered from a
backup tape.

I'm trying to figure out if there is any use for it, as it would take some
work to make it usable (I'd have to write device drivers for available
Ethernet cards, and adapt an ARP implementation for it).
