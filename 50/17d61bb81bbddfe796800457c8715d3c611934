I didn't really mean to shine a light on Kirk, I like Kirk, I'm one of
the few people besides Kirk to work on UFS.

That said, I stand by what I said, it's what happened.  And it seems to
be reflective of the BSD "culture", it appears to be the opposite of
inclusive.  Disappointing.

Linux has a very different culture.  Everyone is welcome and they
maintain sanity largely via Linus willing to call a spade a spade.
He doesn't suffer fools but he's willing to engage with anyone until
they prove themselves to be a fool and nothing more.
