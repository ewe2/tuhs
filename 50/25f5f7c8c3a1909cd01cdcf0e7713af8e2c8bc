Your usage habits are not natural laws.  I'm a systems administrator
too, and I use X11 forwarding every single day, on dozens of different
programs.  

It's all very well for X11's networking tools to be useless for you.
That doesn't make them useless in general, and it doesn't mean the
functionality should be deleted.
