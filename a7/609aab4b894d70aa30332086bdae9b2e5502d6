FreeBSD does. It's my biggest annoyance with Linux that it doesn't.

100k for a process that likely needed 500k to 1MB would indeed be swapping
its brains out. So while tha vax could do I/O 10 times faster than a Z80 of
the era and run maybe 5 times faster, all that was lost when you started
thrashing because you can't keep your working set in memory.
