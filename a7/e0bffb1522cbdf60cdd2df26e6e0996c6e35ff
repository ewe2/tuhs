Subject: [Unix-jun72] Minor bug in sources e09-07
Message-ID: <200805031621.JAA00583@mist.magic.com>

I downloaded the stuff from the svn, got it to build, then did a cmp -l
on the load file from my assembler vs. the one built from the svn tree.

There is a bug in the svn sources on page e09-07, near the bottom.
The call to sleep should read:

	jsr	r0,sleep; 0:..

Note that there should be a colon, not a semi-colon after the 0.
Presumably, this code was never executed, else it would have
resulted in a halt.

After I made that fix, a build from the svn tree is identical to that
from my assembler.
