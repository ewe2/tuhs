My point being that perhaps the success of Unix had more to do
with the success of C than anything else.  And I believe Unix
success had more to with the set of s/w tools it came with
than C. 

For most user programs either language would be been fine. 
Given its evoltion C had the necessary features to implement 
an OS kernel but I believe Pascal could've been easily (&
minimally) extended to something equivalent. Note that Per
Brinch Hansen & his students did write an OS (Solo) in 
Concurrent Pascal[1].

Also note that C itself went through a few iterations while
Pascal was basically the same language that prof. Wirth
defined until 1985.

[1] Solo was a university project + it lacked the greatest
strength of Unix (a set of s/w tools).  So it stayed a uni
project. Concurrent Pascal was a significant extension over
sequential Pascal but PBH explained his rationale by way of
his excellent book on Operating System Design!
