I have to admit that my memories are a bit fuzzy, but I'll try to fill
in what I can.

That it was.  When the INGRES group got our ARPAnet connection (VDH to
LBL, as you mentioned) it was the only long-haul connection to campus
that I know of.  Eric Schmidt had done BerkNET, but that was local mail
and file copy only, and BerkNET mail didn't connect to ARPAnet mail, so
there were "plugboard wars" over who got one of the two RS232
connections we had available for outside users (this was out of a grand
total of 16 connections on a DH-11, each at about $1000/port, iirc).  I
was nominally responsible for the ARPAnet connection, so I had senior
faculty on my case about how they all "needed" dedicated connections to
their office (but of course they didn't want to pay for them).  This was
the original inspiration for delivermail, which later became sendmail.

As I recall IngVax never had any ARPAnet service, and Ing70 was running
the NCP code from San Diego, which could well have originated at BB&N,
but I can't confirm that from memory.  Conversely, Ing70 was never on
any "modern" networking technology such as 3Mbit ethernet (I don't think
there were even NICs at that time).

Yes, modulo it being Ing70, not IngVax.

You would think I would remember more of the network situation around
the INGRES project given that we had someone working on distributed
databases (Ken Birman, now at Cornell I think, did something called
COCANET).  However, I have no recollection at all about what the
connection actually was.  It might be possible to pull some of Ken's old
papers (late 70s/early 80s) and get more information there.
