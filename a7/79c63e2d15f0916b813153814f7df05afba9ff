Michael Sokolov:

  It feels so great knowing that my current modern OS (last release
  2003-12-07 counts as current and modern to me) still has nearly all original V7
  UNIX code almost completely untouched.  It's what gives me the right to call it
  UNIX.

You mean you've restored the original version of cat that had only one option,
and the version of ls that had fewer than a dozen and didn't care how wide
the screen was; that filenames are only 14 characters long; that fsck has
been abolished in favour of icheck and ncheck and dcheck; and that file system
blocks have returned to their original V7 size of 512 bytes?

My hat's off to you if so.

On the other hand, I have to question either your stability or that of your
system if you have reinstated the original V7 code implementing mpx(2).
