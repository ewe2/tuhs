64-bit migration is the ideal solution.  However there is a band-aid 
that can be applied to extend the life of 32-bit only systems.  One 
could reclaim part of the previous epoch window going forward.  That is, 
once 32-bit time_t rolls over, assume any value from -2 billion to some 
additional arbitrary positive time offset had indeed just rolled over.  
Add a whole 0x100000000 to it in a 64-bit context and evaluate (or 
evaluate against the old epoch ~+136 years).  It means a 32-bit time_t 
in this context would instead mis-represent dates from 1902 forward to 
some arbitrary threshold as modern >2038 dates.  But time_t was never 
meant to track dates outside of 'near term' relative to 'modern day' - 
eg +/- 68 years from 1970 when it was conceived.  It's reasonable to 
assume as the use of such software has moved forward in time, its time 
reference should as well.
