Steve Glaser hacked was playing with them at Tektronix in 1979, as he had
put them into their V6 system before I got there IIRC.   I switched the
user code to use Chesson's MPX in V7, which is why I think they never were
used much in V7.

I've forgotten what Bruce used for UNET - I'm CC'ing him here, hoping to
jog his memory.,

Yes, that's right.  And if you were someone like Masscomp or Pyramid trying
to thread both systems, we had both in our kernels.
