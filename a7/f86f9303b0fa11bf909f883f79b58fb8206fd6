It seems to me that you're missing the point here.  It's not a question of
whether or not GNU programs have good documentation.  It's the fact that
GNU made it hard to find documentation because they took one pile and split
it into two with no guide to what was in each pile.  It's not that their
documentation was good or bad, it's that they made it hard to find any
documentation.

Maybe it's because I'm a child of the 60s, but I'm with Arlo Guthrie on this
one (from Alice's Restaurant): "And we decided that one big pile is better
than two little piles, and rather than bring that one up we decided to throw
ours down."
