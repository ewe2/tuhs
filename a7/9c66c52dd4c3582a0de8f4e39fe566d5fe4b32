In 1984 the Programming Systems Groups in Edinburgh's AI department
was contracted by SERC to evaluate workstations for its "Common Base"
program.  We had a Sun 2/120, a Whitechapel MG-1, an Apollo Domain
system, and I think we already had at least one PNX Perq.

We recommended Suns.  I can't find the report we wrote anywhere
online, but I'm fairly sure I've seen it in the last couple of years.

Presumably we gave the evaluation 2/120 back to Sun and bought the one
mentioned by Tim (it was called "islay" unless I have become confused)
a bit later, in 1985.
