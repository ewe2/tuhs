Message-ID: <3FB13B68.7090400@hp.com>

Folks,

After studying the source code for a while, I found a few explicit and 
implicit vaxisms that need to be rectified.  I'd like to purge the 
source entirely of these vaxisms, but that would mean that if anyone 
wants to port what I do back to VAX, they'll need to do some work.

Also, this mailing list is fairly low traffic, and for now my activities 
are very low traffic as well.  Should I set up a separate mailing list 
for those interested in this project?

Opinions?

Pat
