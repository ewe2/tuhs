When I first used =E2=80=9CUnix=E2=80=9D in the late 80=E2=80=99s, most =
of the available source code needed some sort of tweaking to work, =
unless the author happened to have the same system I was using (HP/UX, =
Minix, and a BSD VAX, iirc).  A rummage through the GNU=E2=80=99s =
autoconf docs will (re)acquaint you with he multitude of small =
differences that needed to be accounted for to make most things =
portable.

Then Sun became the dominant vendor, and most things would work out of =
the box on SunOS / Solaris, with different degrees of effort required =
depending on how different your system was.  I was working for a =
DEC-sponsored lab at the time, and Ultrix was more in the BSD camp than =
Solaris, but there was usually someone had done some BSD-style tweaks =
that could be co-opted into mostly working for Ultrix.  Then we got the =
fancy new DEC3000 Alphas, and to a first approximation, *nothing* worked =
(although that was mostly 64 bit pointers, rather than OSF/1).

As Linux has become increasingly popular, things now almost universally =
work out of the box on Linux, with some work required to make macOS, =
*BSD, and the other commercial Unices work.  Often now, there=E2=80=99s =
no autoconf (at least for newer projects) or it=E2=80=99s poorly =
maintained, and I find myself back to the 80s-style patching to get =
stuff to run on systems other than Linux.

Whenever one system becomes too popular, the definition of =E2=80=9CUnix=E2=
=80=9D drifts in that direction =E2=80=A6
