Maybe there are two Larry Allen's - the one who did networking stuff at
MIT-LCS was Larry W. Allen, and I'm pretty sure he didn't do Unix CHAOS code
(he was part of our group at LCS, and we only did TCP/IP stuff; someone over
in EE had a Unix with CHAOS code at the time, so it pre-dated his time with
us).
