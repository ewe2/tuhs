Let me be the first to say that the International Earth Rotation Service 
has announced that there will be a Leap Second inserted at 23:59:59 UTC on 
the 31st December, due to the earth slowly slowing down.  It's fun to 
listen to see how the time beeps handle it; will your GPS clock display 
23:59:60, or will it go nuts like my last one did (I had to power cycle 
the thing)?

My recording of the last one: horsfall.org/leapsecond.webm .
