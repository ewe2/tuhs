Personally, so long as it wasn't garbage code, I've always been sort of
stoked to stumble across my code in strange places.  It's fun to think
that people found it useful.

There was a period of time, not sure if it is true now or not, that my
rewrite of dd(1) was in use at all the disk drive companies.  It has
a lot of tweaks in it for benchmarking, it can do random iops, report
bandwidth or latency, write a known pattern, verify the pattern, etc.
Nothing earth shattering but useful enough that when I talked to people
working on drives they'd mention it when we were talking about performance
stuff.  Neat.
