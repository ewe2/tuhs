Reading some more stuff about the road from 7th Edition to 8th Edition, =
this time about debuggers.

My current understanding is as follows:

- On 6th edition the debugger was =E2=80=98cdb=E2=80=99

- On 7th edition it was =E2=80=98adb=E2=80=99, a rewrite / evolution =
from =E2=80=98cdb=E2=80=99

- In 32V a new debugger appears, =E2=80=98sdb=E2=80=99. Its code seems a =
derivative from =E2=80=98adb=E2=80=99, but the command language is =
substantially reworked and it uses a modified variant of the a.out =
linker format - in essence the beginnings of =E2=80=98stabs=E2=80=99. Of =
course the compiler, assembler, linker and related tools all =
emit/recognize these new symbol table elements.=20

- The July 78 file note by London/Reiser does not mention a reworked =
debugger at all; the 32V tape that is on TUHS has =E2=80=99sdb' files =
that are dated Feb/Mar 1979. This stuff must have been developed between =
July 78 and March 79.

- In the SysIII and 3BSD code on TUHS (from early 80 and late 79 =
respectively) the stabs format is more developed. For SysIII it is =
=E2=80=98VAX only=E2=80=99. With these roots, it is not surprising that =
it is also in 8th Edition.


Two questions:

(1) According to Wikipedia the original author of the stabs format is =
unknown. It also says that the original author of =E2=80=98sdb=E2=80=99 =
is unknown. Is that correct, is the author really unknown?

(2) As far as I can tell, the =E2=80=99sdb=E2=80=99 debugger was never =
back ported to 16 bit Unix, not in the SysIII line and not in the 2.xBSD =
line. It would seem to me that the simple stabs format of 32V would have =
lent itself to being back ported. Is it correct that no PDP11 Unix used =
(a simple) stabs tool chain and debugger?
