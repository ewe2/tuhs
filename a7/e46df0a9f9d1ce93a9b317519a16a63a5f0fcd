I left Digital in 1994, so I don’t know much about the later evolution of the Alphaservers, but 1998 would have been about right for en EV-56 (EV-5 shrink) or EV-6.  There’s a Wikipedia article about all the different systems but most of the dates are missing.

The white label parts are all PAL22V10-15s.  The 8 square chips are cache SRAMS, and most the the SOIC jellybeans are bus transceivers to connect the CPU to RAM and I/O.  The PC derived stuff is in the back corner.  There are 16 DIMM slots to make two ranks of 54 bit RAM out of 8-bit DIMMs.  We usually ran with a SCSI card, an ethernet, and an 8514 graphics card plugged into the riser.

I ended up writing and releasing what I think were the first open source drivers for SCI -- it took a long time to get Dolphin to let me release them.

Dave Conroy designed the hardware, I did the console ROMS (BIOS equivalent) and X server, and Tom Levergood ported OSF-1.  A joint project of DEC Semiconductor Engineering and the DEC Cambridge Research Lab. I think about 20 were built, and the idea kickstarted a line of low end Alphaservers.
