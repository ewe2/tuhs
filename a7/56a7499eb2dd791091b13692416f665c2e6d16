I don't think this is a religious issue.  Please read those pages
carefully.  It's about normal human behavior and expectations.

I can't tell you how many times I've made the same mistakes
listed in those pages.  Many times.  Always wit embarrassment.

My mailer has reply and reply-all and I use them consciously every day.

with the new setting I hit reply-all and I generate 2 copies to the
list...  so this list becomes unlike all the others I am on.

You may still disagree, but I think there is some sound logic 
behind the idea.
