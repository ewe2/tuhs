My understanding had been that BSD and SysV were quite distinct and
that BSD forked off around the early research editions (V6 or V7?), if
indeed 4.3BSD was a major contributor to SVR4 then it would have been
in a few specific areas, e.g. the sockets code, because SysV had its
own competing idea called STREAMS that I believe was later discarded
(or not used much) when the BSD sockets API became the de facto
standard.  Also as I understand it, SunOS was a BSD which had heaps of
development and original ideas put into it (shared libraries I think
is one example), but was discarded as a political decision because
AT&T had managed to convince most corporate customers that BSD was
merely a hack and SysV was the "real unix", so Sun decided to create
Solaris instead by licensing SysV as a starting point, I may have
things slightly backward so I would appreciate if anyone can confirm
this?

cheers, Nick
