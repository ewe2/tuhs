I have seen , I think 2 years ago, a company in California which still 
offered these drives brand new and tapes for them.Try to google.
The only system I know, which supports these drives, is Coherent.
You can still find sources of the driver and eventually port it to SCO.
But probably the manufacturer of this drive offers drivers for SCO.
