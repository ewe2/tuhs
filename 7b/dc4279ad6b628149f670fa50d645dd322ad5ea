Along the same lines:  

As UNIX *transitioned from the relative safety of academia (V7) into the cold, cruel  corporate world (System V), was there a corresponding effort to maintain and protect the UNIX codebase into a unified master repository with SCCS, for example?  

Is there any chance of finding a publicly available UNIX archive that includes the corresponding SCCS data for UNIX---to the extent that SCCS deltas and PRS comments can be examined?

Given that the comments never made it into the compiled code, there
was no space reason to omit comments. There must have been another
reason.
