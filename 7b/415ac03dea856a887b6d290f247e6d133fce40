I've not seen that in an airplane.   I'd like a cite.
There's certainly issues with the computers in some of the later things (like my Volt which is just a rolling computer.   The transmission lever and the gas pedals are just inputs to the computer.   They don't directly control things.   Even the first bit of brake travel is purely a software input).

There's certainly been demonstrations of vehicles being taken over via the entertainment system; why the stereo needs to talk to the engine computer I'll never know...  I know, wind up the volume the faster you go etc, but surely it ought to be one-way?
