I think it's fascinating that we may end up with a working first  
edition Unix which has been *typed in by hand in 2008*. None of the  
bits will actually be the original ones.  Borges would be proud  
("Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote" is the story I am thinking of).

If anyone is looking for volunteers I would have a go at typing bits  
in, but I do not know how much time I'm likely to have.
