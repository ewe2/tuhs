Which is why, after a point, I asked if the results were OK to post.

TBH, I ranged far and wide in my hacking back in the early 80's. I am 
proud of it on the one hand, because it exposed me to systems that I 
would never have had access to. And when I found huge gaping security 
holes, I usually let them know. But on the other hand, well, you've 
expressed the exact sentiment. My only experience with TOPS-20 and UNIX 
early on was because of that.

I never went to college. In fact, I never graduated high school. But I 
was hired as a consultant to do systems programming for TOPS-10 systems 
by the consulting firm that ran BOCES/LIRICS in Dix Hills, NY. I was 
mentored by a great guy, Bruce Maier, and using my hacking experience, I 
continue to this day to try to help both my consulting customers, and 
the general public whenever I can.

I'm a white-hat kinda guy ;)
