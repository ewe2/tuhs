Yes. That's the first release of PWB. However, they took delivery of their
first PDP-11 in 1973, which is when the PWB efforts began as part of the
BIS or BISP business unit (I have conflicting sources on the exact name).

After my talk is complete, I'd planned on going back and trying to piece
together release timelines as well, since although efforts happened
starting in 73, releases, as such, don't seem to start for another couple
of years. I suspect that when the number of groups being supported was
small, the overhead of a formal release cycle likely wasn't worth the
benefits (but have no documentation from the early days to prove that).
