You are mixing a couple of different stories I fear...

If you want the full story get a copy of:   Computer Engineering: A DEC
View of Hardware Systems Design
<https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Engineering-Hardware-Systems-Design/dp/1483207676>

But a snap shot for this mailing list is this ...  The PDP term was used by
KO when he was funding Digital because the VC's the 60s did not believe
that a computer company would succeed.   But making things for the
instrumentation market (Lincoln Labs, Livermore, *etc*.).   This is how
PDP-1 came to be.  The PDP term was keep for the first 25 years (until the
Vax and renaming of the PDP-10/PDP-20 to DECSystem 10/20). [The 1 begat the
6, 9, 15 an 10 families].

The concept of purchasing smaller system, was indeed true.   This was the
idea behind the >>mini-computer<< or *minimal computer* that Gordon Bell
who lad left DEC temporarily to be a CMU Prof for a time began to explore.
 He took the idea and commercialized and the PDP-8 line was the first in
that line.  The 11 & 15 were full computer systems.  DEC also made
something called the PDP-16 'Register Transfer Modules' (RTMs) which was an
attempt to make the small controller idea even more accessible, but the
Intel microprocessor would eclipse them (I think I was the last group at
CMU was talk a course using them.   Another factoid, the predecessor to
VHDL/Verilog and the like, ISPL and ISPS actually spit out 'code' for DEC
RTM modules instead of gates).

But the key point is that in 1975 dollars, a PDP-11/40 system that was good
enough to run something like Sixth Edition of UNIX cost somewhere between
$50k-$150k.   This would have been much, much cheaper than say a PDP-10, or
a equivilent IBM 'mainframe' size system which would have started above $1M.
