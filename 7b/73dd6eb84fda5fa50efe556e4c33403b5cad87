OK, I've dug out my copies.  Two volumes, published by CBS College
publishing, aka Holt, Rinehart and Winston in 1982, both titled "UNIX
Programmer's Manual".  Volume 1 (ISBN 0-03-061742-1) was the man
pages, and volume 2 (ISBN 0-03-061743-X) was the supplementary docs,
starting with =E2=80=9C7th Edition UNIX =E2=80=94 Summary=E2=80=9D, dated S=
eptember 6, 1978.
They have perforated, 3-hole punched pages, clearly intended to be
torn out and put into a three-ring binder.

I've skimmed through both of them, and I can't find any obvious
typesetting errors.  "Typesetting Mathematics" shows some quite
complicated equations.  And in the quick reference in volume 1, all
the troff special characters seem right, even up to less common
characters such as \(bs.  Is there anything specific that I should
look for?  Scans available if they would help.
