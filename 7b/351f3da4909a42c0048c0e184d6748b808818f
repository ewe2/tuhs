I'm referring to the University of Illinois distribution that's in TUHS as
Distributions/Early_Networking/NOSC.
Steve Holmgren led the effort, and it was quite popular. It was V6 based
(it came out in late V5 time frame,
just before V6 was released and quickly updated, the version we have
appears to be based on a pure V6
release). I have seen references to it in the ARPAnet census documents
running on both V6 and V7 (though
mostly they were silent about which version). It was NCP, not TCP/IP. I
thought this was the normal nomenclature
of the time, but I may be mistaken.

We also have BBN's stack as well in Distributions/Early_Networking/BBN. It
appears to be for an 11/40, 11/45
or 11/70, though that's based purely on different files having '70', '45'
and '40' in their name. These are also based
on V6 (at least the code we have has a V6 layout and the few files I diff'd
to V6 were pretty close). There's also an
early VAX version in that directory as well.

One could adapt either of these to V7, and I seem to recall seeing
references to people that did that in the stuff
I read for some of my early Unix talks, but I can't seem to find it right
now.
