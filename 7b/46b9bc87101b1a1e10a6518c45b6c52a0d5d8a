Thanks. My memory of all of this is decaying over time. I'd forgotten about
the AFPA; I believe our RTs either had a 68881 or 68882, but it's been so
long the details are fuzzy: I definitely remember a Motorola FPU, but no
longer remember the model.

This happened outside of IBM, didn't it? What prevented the rest of the VM
code being ported?

I vaguely remember that happening, but by then we had retired the RTs.

I vaguely remember Metaware being somewhat religiously extreme, but again
the details are fuzzy now. Was there some kind of ecclesiastical reference
in the man page?
