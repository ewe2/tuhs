Indeed.  I hated when people cheated because benchmarks should teach you
the capabilities of the machine being benchmarked.  They aren't useful
if people cheat.

When I did LMbench, the rules were "cc -O2" and you could not link with
any benchmarking libraries and you could only report a result if you
reported all results.

I had a beef with this guy: https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~shap/ because he
had some toy OS that didn't have a VM system, didn't have networking,
didn't have much of anything, but boy oh boy, did it context switch
fast (because there was no context to speak of).  He reported those
numbers in blatant violation of my rules and I had to escalate to 
get him to stop.  The bummer is he is a smart guy, capable of good
work, there is no need to cheat.
