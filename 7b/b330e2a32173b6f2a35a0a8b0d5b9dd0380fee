DMA too, hence the process is locked in core.  I think the read/write had 
to be a multiple of 512 bytes as well (I lost my Edition 6 manuals along 
with my treasured -- and original! -- Lions books in a house move).

IIRC, the driver kept track of the current block under the head, and 
issued forward/backward skips accordingly; I have no idea whether SimH 
gets that right (as opposed to doing a random seek).

(It bloody well worked, Mr Minnich, OK?)
