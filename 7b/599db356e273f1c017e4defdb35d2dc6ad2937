I dunno.  That 1985 map has uwisc in there and I know from being there
that they were in because they were doing a lot of useful work, there
was the uwisc-bsd+NFS release, there was the uwisc bsd port to the IBM
rt, I watched Joe Moran do a port of BSD to a 68K in a couple of days
(literally, he stayed up for 2 days and got it to work), uwisc was the
shit back in the day.  I'm not bragging because of me, I was nobody,
but a lot of somebodies came out of uwisc.  Most of them went to Sun.
Joe went on to do the SunOS 4.x VM system which to this day I have not
seen a better one.

So maybe they weren't the 11th IMP on the net.  I dunno, I do know
that someone told me that.

I do know that prior to the net there was uucp and ....!uwisc was a
useful prefix like ...!rutgers and ...!ucbvax.

I think they were in the mix.  11th?  Dunno, just what I've been told.
