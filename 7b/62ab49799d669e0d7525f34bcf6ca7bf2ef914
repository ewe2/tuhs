For the 8088, it depends. If you don't care about no memory protection,
then the segments make a nice fairly granular way to slice up the space
between 'processes'. Old-school Unix for the 8088 used 'small model' to get
relocatable binaries anywhere in the 1MB space. For that use case, it's
quite convenient.

Of course, for anything else, or if you want memory protection, or demand
pages, or well a bunch of other stuff here, it totally sucks.
