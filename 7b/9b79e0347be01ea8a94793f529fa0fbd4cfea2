Subject: [pups] The infamous 2.11BSD patch archive
Message-ID: <20030120194135.A19753@bcr10.uwaterloo.ca>

  This *must* be a FAQ, but I didn't find a real answer to it anywhere.

  What's up with the 2.11BSD patch archive?  I assume that the version
in the Unix Archive is the original release and does not have these
patches applied.  The mirror to which 2bsd.com referrs is gone and I
don't want to pound on Steve's site if I don't have to.  Any
suggestions?  Once I get the files I presume I'm just supposed to feed them
through patch in sequence (with the appropriate options, of course).
