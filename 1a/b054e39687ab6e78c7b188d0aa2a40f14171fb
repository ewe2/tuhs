...and even today, while the GNU userland sees reasonable use (just
about every Linux distribution targetting the desktop or server niches
use it, except for the few minimalistic ones that rely primarily on
Busybox, so it's pretty hard to run Linux and not GNU), GNU Hurd lives
a life of obscurity and few even know what it is, let alone knows
anyone who uses it for anything even half-way serious.
