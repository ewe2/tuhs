Hi Will,

The book is better.  I learnt Unix from it having read K&R to learn C
and being intrigued by these sample commands that were presented.
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/013937681X/trofforg-20
I used to rent time on a 3B2 in a neighbouring town a train-ride away
and go there on a Saturday to actually type in what the book presented.

That stopped when I traded in my ARM-based Acorn Archimedes 310 for
Acorn's R140 running BSD 4.2-based Risc iX; like Tony Finch mentioned
the other day IIRC.  ARM 3, 4 MiB RAM, and a 56 MB Rodime ST-506 drive
that housed everything including X and iXi.Desktop(sp?).  Everything on
disk was compressed to fit;  luckily the ARM could decompress quicker
than the rust could spin.

Cheers, Ralph.
