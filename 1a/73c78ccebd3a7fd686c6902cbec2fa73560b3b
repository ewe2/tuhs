As a university student in the 1980s we had a cluster of Sun 3/50s using 
a Gould computer as a file server over NFS.  The system administrators 
had quotas enabled (5MB per student) to prevent students gobbling up 
disk space.

Here's an email I received when I used more disk space than what was 
allowed.

As a user and an admin I never used this and, while I thought it was interesting, just figured that the users would sort it out amongst themselves. Which they mostly did.
