"Cuckoo's Egg", by Cliff Stoll, and his accounts of that whole business
are interesting. Incidentally that's the book that hatched my interests
in things UNIX. And as it happens, I constantly, perhaps every couple of
months read it. Dennis, did you see my message on when a GUI was first
available with UNIX? If so, please contact me off-list. Or even on-list.
