A year or two earlier, maybe: the Master File Directory of UNIVAC
EXEC-8.  It's an amazingly complex and quite versatile system that
makes the Unix file system look simple.  There's some documentation at
http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/univac/1100, though right now I
can't find the references I'm looking for.

Agreed.  In fact, I'd go as far as to say that it's one of the most
important features of Unix.  And I'm pretty sure that the MFD didn't
have anything as straightforward and powerful.  But I'll research and
see if I can comeup with something interesting.
