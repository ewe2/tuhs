Subject: [TUHS] The birth of the Z3

Way back on this day in 1941, Conrad Zuse unveiled the Z3; it was the 
first programmable automatic computer as we know it (Colossus 1 was not 
general-purpose).  The last news I heard about the Z3 was that she was 
destroyed in an air-raid...

This pretty much started computing, as we know it.
