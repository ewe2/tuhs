Well after that piece of code was written! :-)

I don't recall exactly off the top of my head, but I recall 2-3 notes to
users about the evolution of C post 'vanilla' V6; I think a lot of it was
related to work being done on typetting stuff, hence the moniker
'phototypsetter compiler' which was applied to that 'improved' C. 

One of the notes is fairly common, but another I have only in hardcopy
(although I scanned it at one point).

I'll try and turn all of them, along with some notes I made about the
differences between 'vanilla' V6 C and 'phototypsetter C' (which a lot of the
later V6 users started with - I certainly did), into an article on the
Computer History wiki on the early evolution of C.
