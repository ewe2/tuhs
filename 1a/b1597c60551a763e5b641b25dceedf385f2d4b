I also think it is team size.  We never had more than 8 engineers on
BitKeeper, and the core was really 4, and we kept adding features and the
main code topped out at 128K lines.  It got to 120K or so pretty quickly
and then we just kept pushing for changesets that removed as much code
as they added, bonus points for when they removed more than they added.

I think if we had more people it would have been harder to keep things
small and clean.
