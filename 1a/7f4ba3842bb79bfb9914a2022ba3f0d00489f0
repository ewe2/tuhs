A somewhat different view on the Starbucks story:

A friend of mine moved here from New Mexico (which is a fantastic place to
live, amazing, I used to live there) and she said "It's unbelievable - you
can watch people and realize that they are actually thinking before they
are talking".

Indeed.  I'd rather be in the midst of rude people thinking than any sort
of people not thinking.
