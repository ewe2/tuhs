We are breaking ground in new ways to use hundreds of processors to solve problems very quickly.  It's a new way of thinking, and it makes your brain hurt.  But is is what the hardware is giving us, and there is at least another order of magnitude ahead before this trend starts running out of steam.

This sounds like a software equivalent of an FPGA! You probably
have similar to "EDA" tools for placement and routing and 
mapping a program written in "HDL" to the underlying technology.
Mapping APL to this could be fun (APL programs have a similar
brain hurting side-effect!).
