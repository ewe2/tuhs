 Subject: would any of this be useful to TUHS?

I am cleaning out my attic.  What does that mean??  It means a lot of
AT&T documentation and software needs to find a home to avoid ending
in the dumpster. I have documentation and sfotware for the 6300+ and the
3B2.  Some of it still in the original shrink-wrap.

And yes, this is on topic.  I also have quite a bit of software and
documentation for the Unix-PC as well.  Much of this still in the 
original packaging.  OS, Development sets, utilities.  everything must
go.  I also have three complete Unix-PC's and two without disks or
heads but with functional motherboards.  At least all of this stuff
was functional the last time I actually turned any of them on.  I have
one that I just fired up (that's already been claimed) to test it and
it works fine, so i assume the same is true of the others.  I would
probably be willing to let all of them go at this point.  Nice machines,
but my PDP's and VAXen need the room.

Now the only string.  I will not ship any of this.  it is located in
NEPA in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area and must be collected.  And it
must be soon.

One person can claim it all and then ship it to others if they wish,
or people can email me asking for particular packages.  First come,
first served.  If you know of any other places where there might be
interest in the 3B2 or 6300+ stuff feel free to forward this message.

All the best.
bill
