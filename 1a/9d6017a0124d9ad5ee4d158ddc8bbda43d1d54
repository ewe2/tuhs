MH's message/file format was also the inspiration for B news, which kept 
each Usenet message in a separate RFC733 format file. (The command line 
interface, however, was more like a feed, not separate shell commands.) 
No control-A separators, though, just separate files.

To clarify, I was joking when I mentioned Eric Schmidt as a possible 
author of delivermail. (I should have inserted a smiley.) I wasn't 
directly involved, as Eric Allman was in the Ingres project on a 
different system, but I thought he (Eric Allman) wrote delivermail, and 
so does Wikipedia. I think Kurt Shoens wrote only the MTA, but i could 
be mistaken.

I didn't write termcap, Bill Joy did. I wrote terminfo, but that was 
later when I was at Bell Labs in 1982. Ken's curses used termcap, my 
1982 rewrite used terminfo.
