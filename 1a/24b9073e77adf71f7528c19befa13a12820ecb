Subject: [Unix-jun72] Readme written: needs checking
Message-ID: <20080507013359.GA78359@minnie.tuhs.org>

I've just written a Readme to describe how to build the kernel and filesystems,
and to run 1st Edition UNIX. Can a few people who haven't actually used the
system please have a go and give me feedback on the Readme.

To fetch the repository:

svn checkout http://unix-jun72.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ unix72

Then go into the new unix72/ and read the Readme.

Thanks,
	Warren
