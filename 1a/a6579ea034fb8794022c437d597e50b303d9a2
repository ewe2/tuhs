I think that's basically correct, although in some technical sense "SunOS" is still the name for the OS component of Solaris (or was until recently - Oracle have probably renamed it), so you probably mean "SunOS n" where n<=4.

I think (though I am not sure) that a lot of the virtual memory and shared library stuff which originated in SunOS 4 moved wholesale into SunOS 5, as well.
