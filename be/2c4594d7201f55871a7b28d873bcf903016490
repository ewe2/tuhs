Hi

Personally, I'm very grateful for the amount of time you've spent not 
simply finding and posting the things you do (this, cmu mach, the BSD 
and Unix stuff) but also the blog entries you write that spell out the 
steps you take to get it all running.

As someone who came along much later (slackware 3.5?, freebsd 
2.2-something) but has a lot of interest/curiosity about what the older 
days were like it's very helpful and illuminating.

Oh! ...and of course, Happy Birthday 386BSD!

Regards,

-a Virtuallyfun fan/reader
