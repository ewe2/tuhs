Highly unlikely. After all they didn't buy out their Unix license like Sun 
did. IRIX has been basically abandoned by SGI which is a pity. However 
their is quite an IRIX user community at Nekochan with 1500 members on the 
forums: http://forums.nekochan.net/index.php

Nekoware as it called is probably the best repositry of 
freeware/opensource software out their for IRIX these days. Even SGI's own 
freeware site points to them.
