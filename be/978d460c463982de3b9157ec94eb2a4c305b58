I seem to recall that this story was included as part of The Cuckoo's 
Egg, by Clifford Stoll. I don't recall the specifics and I wonder if it 
has a bit of myth included, but somehow it was peripherally related to 
the investigations. Fuzzy recollection is that the worm got out during 
the investigation Clifford was involved in and it was Morris's son 
(Morris being in on the investigation somehow), and the kid getting off 
because of the position of the dad and the newness of the crime... or 
somesuch - don't shoot the messenger, but nobody mentioned Stoll, so I 
thought I'd chime in, in the hopes it might jog someone else's memory :).
