I know you've all been on the edge of your seats waiting for this, but...

I finally got my PDP-11/73 working, using a wyse terminal instead of my PC
-- for some reason neither of the serial ports were sending on the PC (but
then again, I boughtthe motherboard in an alley in korea three years
ago)...  Anyway, it boots up with RSTS/E version 9, which is OK in it's
own little way, I guess, but I'd rather be running Unix on it.  

So where can I download the binaries for 2.11BSD?

There are at least two different standards for the ribbon-cable-to-D-sub
adapters, and of course it's guaranteed that you'll use the wront type :-).

Easiest way is for you to tell us what sort of load media you can use and
have someone write an install tape for you.  Do you have a TK50 or other tape
drive on the system?

What Greg says is true: we can't give you access to any UNIX source
code unless you have a UNIX source license from SCO. However....
I should ask Dion at SCO if we could distribute binary-only distributions
of 2.x BSD without a license. After all, freely distributable binary-only
distributions for v5, v6, v7 and Venix (System III-ish) exist.

Just a thought, but for now you do need a source license.

Cheers,
