Seconded!!  I could not have said this better myself.

Speaking at least for myself, it was clear at the time that UNIX and
what was happening was extremely special, and many of the people I went
to school with lusted after jobs at Bell Labs / AT&T in order to be
involved with it.  Those of you who were there really were part of a
"golden age".  Computing isn't nearly as much fun anymore.

So, the more stories the better!
