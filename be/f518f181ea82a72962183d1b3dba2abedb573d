Yes, exactly right. That's always in the back of my mind, so sometimes I
forget to make it explicit. What I should have said that the CACM paper
possibly indicates that UNIX went through the stages:

	"rwrw" + "x" ==> "rwxrwx" ==> "rwxrwxrwx"

sometime between the points in time known as 3rd and 4th Editions.

Thanks John,
