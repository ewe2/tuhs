You need to distinguish between the many for which he was an editor (e.g. IP,
TCP, etc), and the (relatively few, compared to the others) which he actually
wrote himself, e.g. RFC-925, "Multi-LAN address resolution".

Not that he didn't make absolutely huge contributions, but we should be
accurate.
