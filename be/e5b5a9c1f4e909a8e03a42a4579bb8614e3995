On a personal note, I happened to be at the annual Berkeley Unix Workshop 
which started just before the Worm was released 
(http://www.cs.unc.edu/~jeffay/courses/nidsS05/attacks/seely-RTMworm-89.html). 
I'd been invited to speak about the work on AIX & 4.3 convergence 
(http://technologists.com/sauer/Convergence_of_AIX_and_4.3BSD.pdf). I was 
delighted to finally meet and hang out with people that I only knew by name. 
I particularly remember spending time with Keith Bostic and Rick Rashid. As 
I remember, the Workshop was conducted almost as planned, with real time 
reports of the Worm analysis and control.

The infamous Morris Worm was released in 1988; making use of known
vulnerabilities in Sendmail/finger/RSH (and weak passwords), it took out a
metric shitload of SUN-3s and 4BSD Vaxen (the author claimed that it was
accidental, but the idiot hadn't tested it on an isolated network first).
A temporary "condom" was discovered by Rich Kulawiec with "mkdir /tmp/sh".
