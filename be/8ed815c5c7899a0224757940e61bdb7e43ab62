It did do something really interesting tho; segments could have multiple
names.

Given a segment "foo", you could "add_name foo bar". "foo" and "bar" now
refer to the same segment, much like a UNIX link. However, if you move the
segment to another directory, the names follow -- they are part of the
segment metadata, not entries in the segment's directory.

This was leveraged by the binder; when binding an executable segment with
multiple entry points, the binder will add the entry points to the names of
the segment, and the shell would select the correct entry point based on
the name.

    bound_dir_cmds_
       list
       rename
       delete

You can use 'bound_dir_cmds_$list' or 'list'.
