Not that anyone asked, but...

My introduction to Perl was motivated by a performance issue.  I had =
been using a set of sh/awk/... scripts to generate the source files =
(troff and file trees) for my Prime Time Freeware book/CD-ROM =
collections.  One of the cooler aspects of this approach was that I =
could use sh as a macro processor, substituting assorted values into the =
awk (etc) code.

However, running the scripts was taking about three hours (!), so I =
tended to start them up just before going to bed.  This worked, for some =
value of "work", but it was kind of a nuisance...

So, upon the recommendation of Erik Fair, I transliterated my scripts =
into Perl.  The similarity of Perl syntax to my previous combination of =
languages was so strong that the effort was almost mindless.  And, even =
though I made no attempt to use any Perlish features, the new scripts =
ran about five (!) times faster.  My assumption is that this was mostly =
due to getting rid of the process startup times.

My move to Ruby was motivated by the Perl 6 clusterfudge.  After =
watching Perl 5 sit at a siding for a few years, with no relief in =
sight, I took another friend's advice and tried out Ruby.  Aside from a =
few odd differences, it was quite familiar and a very easy transition.  =
However, the syntax seemed much "cleaner" than Perl's (Matz has very =
good taste, IMHO).  So, it's still my choice for small, single-threaded =
scripts.

That said, if I want to write larger and/or concurrent apps, I turn to =
Elixir.  It gives me Ruby-like syntax (with nifty extensions such as =
pipes), strong support for concurrency and distribution, macros, etc.
