Segments. :-) (This is an old argument between Johnny and me, I'm not trying
to re-open it, just yanking his chain... :-)

In theory, at least (I don't know of an OS that made use of this), didn't the
memory management hardware allow the possibility to do demand-paging? I note
that Access Control Field value 0 is "non-resident".

Unix kinda-sorta used this stuff, to automatically extend the stack when the
user ran off the end of it (causing a trap).

Especially on the later machines, with more than 256KB of hardware main
memory. Maybe it might have been useful on the earlier ones (e.g. the -11/45).
