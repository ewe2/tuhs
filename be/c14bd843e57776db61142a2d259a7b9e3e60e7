The compiler I used at least tried to be C89. (Borland Turbo C++ 1.01)

Which was nice with the tiny model: a .COM file organized at near 0x0100, 
and iirc, there was guaranteed to be 0xCD 0x20 at 0x0000.  (The 8086 "INT 
20H" instruction.  I just checked in DOSEMU with PC DOS 7, and that is 
exactly what shows up there.)

"ANSI C" doesn't mean a lot though when 95% of the code I run across uses 
extensions.  I still have not successfully kitbashed the Bourne shell onto 
native DOS, OS/2 or Windows without an emulation layer - in any form.  Did 
come *pretty* close with the Forsyth shell but I couldn't work around the 
lack of fork() (OS/2 does have a near-exact counterpart for pipe(), but 
it's not exposed by the pipe() call for some reason.)  I like my Unix 
shells even on Microsoft OSes...call me crazy. ;)

-uso.
