Subject: [TUHS] signals and blocked in I/O
Message-ID: <20171201154448.GL3924@mcvoy.com>

Does anyone remember the reason that processes blocked in I/O don't catch
signals?  When did that become a thing, was that part of the original
design or did that happen in BSD?

I'm asking because I'm banging on FreeBSD and I can wedge it hard, to
the point that it won't recover, by just beating on tons of memory.
