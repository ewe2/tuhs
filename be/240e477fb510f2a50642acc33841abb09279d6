I have 3 different MMUs available. Stack, Code and Data it is called in
the Circuit diagram. I probably have to lookup the references but I still
don't get why the kernel can only work with 64k of RAM as it is right now

Only the boot0-loader is compiled unsegmented and also some small
utilities. Every other portion of the system uses the segmentation features
of the Z8001 and is not limited to 64k adressable space.

The system has right now MB of
