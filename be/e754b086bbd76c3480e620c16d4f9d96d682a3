I've double-checked, and disk1/4.1 from Kirk's archive is definitely 4.0,
(with the addition of a 4.0.upgrade directory taken from a 4.1 distributio=
n).

As far as online 4.1 tape images are concerned, I did a bit more investiga=
ting:

AFAICT this file: http://bitsavers.org/bits/BSD/BSD4.1_bootable.tap.gz app=
ears
to be the closest online thing to a 7/10/1981 version of 4.1.

This file: http://bitsavers.org/bits/UCB_CSRG/41bsd_7-10-81.tap contains f=
iles
with modification times up through June 1982.

Neither of these include the corresponding /usr/doc or /usr/ingres (which =
would
have been on the distribution tape #2).  Those seem to be missing altogeth=
er.
