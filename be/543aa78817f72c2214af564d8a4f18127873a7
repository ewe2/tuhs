That would be the first version to run on the PDP-11/45; I'm not sure which one
that was, there's not enough left of Version 2 or Version 3 to see; Version 4
definitely ran on the 11/45:

No, they came after the -11/45 (with the KT11-C MMU).

They got one of the first -11/45's, per a Unix history document I'm too busy
to dig up, so 1972.
