THE best engineer and software architect that I ever worked with.  At
least as talented as Dave Cutler, without the arrogance and nasty
temper.  A conference room in DEC's Nashua NH software engineering
facility was named after him.

One of Dick's April Fool's Day hacks, the SD-730 Solar Horologue was
kept in the Hustvedt conference room for many years.  It is now at VMS
Software, Inc.
