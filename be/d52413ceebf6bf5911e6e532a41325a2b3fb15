If this helps at all, I've been working (very, very slowly) on a port of
v32 to Intel platforms.  At first I used gcc for some kernel work, but
quickly realized that it would be overwhelming to the final v7 system. 
Since I don't want to do the work twice, I looked for a different compiler
suite.  I switched to the ACK compiler suite and just finished the WinXP
cross compiler work.  It has a pdp11 back end, which I have yet to try,
that may be useful.

It isn't gcc, but ir does do ANSI C and the i386 assembler seems to be
pretty complete.  Let me know if there's any interest and I'll put it up
on my site for download.
