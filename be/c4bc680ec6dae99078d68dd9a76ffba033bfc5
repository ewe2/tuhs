I've just asked someone who knows, and he elaborated my very vague
memory: yes it did, and in fact there was mmap right back, and beyond,
the start of SunOS.  *But* it only mapped devices, particularly
framebuffers, where it was obviously very useful.  SunOS 4 had a
fully-fledged mmap.

I am fairly sure that 4.2BSD had manual pages for mmap, but it didn't
work.
