We have a DG Aviion machine but is not working, is part of our
computer museum. Also, our machine is not a PentiumPro but a
very esoteric one, using a motorila 68020 processor (if I
remember well, maybe I'm wrong)

If I understand, can you ship your machine, for example, to our
computer museum? :) 

Ah, no, You want a similar machine! :)

p.s. a copy of the operating system or a dump of the DISK/OS
will be appreciated, is very important to save this kind of
software, very hard to found today.
