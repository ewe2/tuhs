I've done both of those, along with "System down for disk crashing at 
...".  It was sort of true, as it was scheduled maintenance which involved 
removing the RK-05 disks, prising them open with something like a speculum 
(in the open air!), and running some sort of a deflection gauge along the 
platter to see how warped it was.  I think the DEC Field Circus 
Ginger-Beer also wiped the heads and replaced the NiCd battery...
