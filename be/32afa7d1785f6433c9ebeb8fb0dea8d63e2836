Speaking of time zones, has anyone written code to update ctime.c for 
the changes to the US rules in 2007? (let alone any non-US rules) and 
have a list of what binaries need to be recompiled for changes to 
daylight saving rules?

Also, I'm looking at ctime.c, and i'm not sure if the current code 
handles leap years correctly.

It might be nice to have a repository for little things like that, 
y2k-compliance (there are a couple 19112's in there IIRC), and so on.
