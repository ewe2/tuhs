But in Plan9, the console is assumed to be a bitmap device.  Perhaps
with the exception of, say, the file server.  But there is no reason
why that has to be the case - certainly not on modern "file server"
hardware.  It's just an artifact of how cpurc is set up.  It's
trivially changable, should you desire to.
