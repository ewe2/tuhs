I went to school with a guy that went to Data General, I could try
and track him down.

Back in that time I was quite active in file system work for Sun and
I looked at what other people were doing (I was also teaching the 
grad course in operating systems at Stanford so I was twice as
motivated to look).  I don't recall hearing about any significant
FS work at DG but I may have missed it.

Anyway, I probably can track it down if you really want it.  Be happy 
to reconnect with him.
