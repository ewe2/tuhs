At least in the 80's, there was a BSD 4.3 port for the IBM PC/RT's
that was called "AOS", for "Academic Operating System".  For proof
that my memory isn't playing tricks on me, here's independent
confirmation :-)

	https://archiveos.org/aos/

At the time, it was pretty popular at MIT's Project Athena, mostly
because the RT's were contemporaneous with the MicroVax's, but had
three times faster integer operations, which made running TeX and
LaTeX a far more pleasant experience for those of us who were
typesetting papers and problem sets.  :-)

When AOS was sunset and Athena was frog-marched to use AIX, RT's
suddenly became far less popular.  :-/
