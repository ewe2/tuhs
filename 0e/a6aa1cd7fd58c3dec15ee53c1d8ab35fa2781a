Greg Chesson. He designed the uucp g protocol. There was a piece of  
networking gear at Murray hill that Greg worked on that every now and  
then would fail to connect. Someone modified the message to read "it's  
all Greg's fault.". Later the string became an errno, I think for the  
Netb file server protocol. Plan 9 still has an EGREG even though it is  
a string in plan 9. It now reads "Ken has left the building."
