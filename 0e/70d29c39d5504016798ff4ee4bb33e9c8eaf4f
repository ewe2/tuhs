Odd; I could've sworn that "URK" was un-rotated i.e. traditional format; 
are you sure about that?

And "unswbatch"...  Ahhh... I must take a look at that distribution some 
time, to see whether it has my fingerprints on it; Kevin Hill and I 
totally rewrote the system, throwing out IanJ's rubbish, with him doing 
the application stuff ("submit" etc[*]) and me doing the driver.  After 
that, it actually worked (once I'd figured out a nasty bug in KRONOS' 
UT-200 driver, that led to a POLL/REJECT loop).

[*]
I did a memorable hack to "submit" once; you see, we had an old VT-05
in the fishbowl, facing outwards for the sheeple, and it displayed the
batch queue (by title) in real time.  Well, me being me, I hacked up the
aforesaid "submit" command to take multiple arbitrary files as input with
a specified title, so for a while it displayed "xxx...  LLAMAS   ARE 
BIGGER   THAN     FROGS" (job names were 8 characters, and I have no idea
how that will display in people's MUAs)..

(I *think* I was actually working for them at that time.)
