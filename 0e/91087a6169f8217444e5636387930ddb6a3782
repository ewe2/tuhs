By now found some more clues, in particular this link:
http://computer-programming-forum.com/47-c-language/fab825b2dce1aa59.htm

Apparently I am talking about PCC and PCC2 in the below question.

The first post mentions 4 papers. They can be found online, apart from =
the USENIX one:
"Four Generations of Portable C Compiler" by D.M. Kristol (1986 Summer =
USENIX Conference Proceedings)

Anybody have that?

The second post mentions official documentation:

"In porting QCC, a useful text is the "Portable C Compiler -=20
Version 2 (PCC2) Internals".  It includes documentation of=20
stin file formats, PCC2 tree forms, debugging flags, and=20
compiler #defines.  The manual is expensive so it's worth it=20
most if you buy it before you figure it all out doing a=20
port.  Since the manual is based on PCC2 (and hasn't been=20
updated), it's a good starting point, but doesn't have the=20
latest information.=E2=80=9D

Anybody have that? (It is not on bitsavers)
