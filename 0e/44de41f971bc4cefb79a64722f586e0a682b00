We had are Netinfo server lookup passwords from our Solaris system and =
we used that through Mac OS X Server which I think stopped at version =
1.2 or 1.6. They then switched the directory system when Mac OS X client =
was released  to Open Directory which was an OpenLDAP. The Open =
Directory was kerberized and all services that were shipped used =
kerberos.  This could act as Directory Domain server for windows =
clients.
