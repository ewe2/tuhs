Message-ID: <20180216210114.GA27574@mcvoy.com>

So people have called me on the claim that lisp is not fast.  Here's a 
rebuttal.

Please write a clone of GNU grep in lisp to demonstrate that the claim
that lisp is slower that C is false.

Best of luck and I'll be super impressed if you can get even remotely
close without dropping into C or assembler.  If you do get close, I 
will with draw my claim, stand corrected, point future "lisp is slow"
people at the lisp-grep, and buy you dinner and/or drinks.
