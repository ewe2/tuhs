That's not true, Sunbox was all 5.x code.  I spent about 3 years in the
5.x source base.

You've been arguing with a guy who was in the kernel group and I've tried to
set you straight and you just keep coming back with misinformation.

The VM system was ported from SunOS 4.x to System 5.  Your statements that
SVr4 is based on SunOS are flat out wrong.  SVr4 got a lot of SunOS goodness
but the starting point was ATT System V.

Yup, that Shannon.

The fact that Glenn didn't put me on that patent is a sore point.  Yes,
he wrote the lisp code that showed it could be done.  I wrote the C code
that did that in one pass (his stuff was N+M where N was how many deltas
were on the local side and M was how deltas were on the remote side).
