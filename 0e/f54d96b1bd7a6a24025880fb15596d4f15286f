Hello,

Bob Supnik made a new open-source multi-platform emulator
called SIMH. The website is: http://simh.trailing-edge.com

There is "software kits" for many platforms supported
by SIMH. Unix 7 for PDP-11 is included. They are available
here: http://simh.trailing-edge.com/software.html

The accompanying documentation is available here:
http://simh.trailing-edge.com/pdf/simh_swre.pdf

It is very easy to set-up systems with these kits and this
documentation.

You will be able to run Unix 7 with SIMH soon.

I hope to have helped you.

I am french too :-)
