We should never be depending on a human being able to write "perfect
code".  Instead, we need to come up with processes so that imperfect
code doesn't escape into production *despite* the fact that humans are
fallible.  Such processes might include requiring unit tests,
integration tests, stress tests, etc., requiring code reivews by a
second pair of eyes, perhaps using formal proofs, having multiple
implementations of critical algorithms, cross-checking the results
from those independent implementations, and so on.

The space shuttle used a number of these techniques.  It did *not*
depend on super-human, Über-programmers.
