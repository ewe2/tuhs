 |Looking at the code for getty in various versions, it looks like 4.2BSD

 |portion to lowercase (thus allowing email addresses to be
 |case-insensitive for delivery to local usernames that must be in all

 |
 |(All of this can probably be rounded down to "Usernames should be
 |defined as all-lowercase")

If i recall correctly the email standards go for case-preserving
all through, to leave it up to the destination to apply whatever
is appropriate locally.
