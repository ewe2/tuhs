This may have been true of the very first Multics machines, but it appears
they switched to solid state memory sometime in the 70s (it's not clear to
me when the SCUs attached to the 6180 switched from core to DRAM:
https://gunkies.org/wiki/Honeywell_6000_series). By the time the DPS8/M
rolled out we must assume they had DRAM. Apparently a cache hierarchy was
added eventually.
