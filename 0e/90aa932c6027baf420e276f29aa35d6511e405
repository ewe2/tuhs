Well, I've got a nephew who's been at Oracle for like 20+ years; he can
probably point us at the right person.

Why do we need that? Can't they say 'any and all versions of SunOS', and that
term ('SunOS') is sufficiently well defined in real-world documents (e.g. Sun
licenses) that that should be 'good enough'.

It sounds like the _actual code_ is reasonably available, we wouldn't need
Oracle to go looking around for it, would we?
