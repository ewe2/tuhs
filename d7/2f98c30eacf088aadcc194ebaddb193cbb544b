I have seen fly-by i think two CVE announcements for BMW.
I can only find one format-string related one via search engine.

Truly hate that; that job used to be fun with craftsmanship rather
than plugging in a service computer and reading error logs.
I never will forget that film about Rolls Royce in the 80s: one
man, his hammer, a small table with tea right beside the working
place, and three days of work to get a single fender.
I wonder how this will end up when 3-D printers can produce
furniture, clothes, houses and all that.  No real work to be done
anymore, and i do not like Harley-Davidson for having some real
work to do.  (New Moto Guzzi also have CAN-bus i think.)
