It makes sense that it used to be paper based and slow on screen.

Regarding the links and old bsd's. The binary cr3 on 1bsd works in v7. 
Also, the book I'm reading has a c program that does paging. But, I'm 
always off down the rabbit hole... I tried to compile the cr3.c source 
and I get this error:

# cc cr3.c
Undefined:
_fout
_flush
_getc
_end

My understanding is that cc includes libc by default, so these must not 
be in libc. But getc is standard lib, so what am I missing?

Thanks,

Will
