For the earlier code as shipped with BSD see:

4.0 and 4.1  usr/src/cmd/fsck.c
static char *sccsid = "@(#)fsck.c       4.10 (Berkeley) 11/15/80";

The changes document from (January 1980's 3BSD to November 1980's 4BSD) 
calls it the "new ... interactive repair program" and "new, intelligent, 
interactive file system check program" and that it obsoletes dcheck and 
ncheck and largely replaces icheck.

4.1.snap
static  char *sccsid = "@(#)fsck.c      4.13 (Berkeley) 81/03/09";

2.8 (Jun 16  1981 filestamp)
        char    *sccsid = "@(#)fsck.c   2.5";

From those versions it is easy to see that the later main.c derived from 
the fsck.c. (By the time it gets to the version shipped with 4.3BSD
