I came late to UNIX.  I was not in the proper fiefdom at my
university.  We used VMS and Minix on PCs (I actually received a
samizdat copy from someone in med-sci).  Enlightment came when the
dep't bought a bunch of Sun kit.  By then the two-volume PH series
(with building blocks on the cover, I recall -- most apt) and I read
them cover to cover.  Workflow backend changed but upfront design et
cetera did not.
