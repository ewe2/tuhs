Setjmp/longjmp do more (setjmp returns different values
for the initial call and the longjmp-invoked one).
But the thing that would become more important
is that the PDP-11 compiler's calling sequence was
especially friendly toward restoring register values--
it just worked automatically.

Other machines and compilers were not so friendly.
This is why ANSI and ISO had to put in special rules
about promising to preserve only things marked
volatile.

We've been through this before.
