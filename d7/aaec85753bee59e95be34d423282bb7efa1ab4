I started off with TECO on RT-11; talk about cryptic...

Shortly after I switched to "ed" on the 11/40 someone brought out "em" 
(editor for mortals) which was sort of a screen editor: I recall saying 
"what a stupid command name" as it was only a fumble away from "rm" :-(

A boss of mine insisted that everyone had to learned "ed", because after a 
system crash it might be the only editor available; that, or having to 
dial in over a slow modem.
