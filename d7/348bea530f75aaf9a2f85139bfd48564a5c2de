Subject: [pups] mystery LSI-11 heath H11 board
Message-ID: <20000820133009.G12503@goldberry.poofy.goof.com>

an electrician came in to my place of employment last week and installed
some new lighting in the "engineering junkyard" which was previously a
very dark place.  The new light prompted me to do some exploring, and in
doing so, I spotted a heath H11!

unfortunately, it looks like the case has been stripped, as only one
half-height board remains in the cardcage.  The handle is labeled "Heath
Serial I/O." I threw it on a flatbed scanner and the pictures are here:

Is this one of heathkit's almost-like-DEC-but-not-quite boards?
