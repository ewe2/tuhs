Let's keep it civil and non-personal, I don't think Rob was pointing 
at anyone, I think he was pointing at some not so forward thinking.

I have to side with Rob on this one, even though I'm squarely in the
I like C best camp.

While I _can_ do all the malloc/free stuff myself (and have decades of
working code to prove it), it's become harder and harder to find other
people who can.  Younger programmers just sort of stare at you with a
"I have to do what?" look.  They think you are a dinosaur for working
like that when other reasonable languages do that work for you.

When I did little-lang.org, granted, not widely used but we used it a
lot, it did all the memory management behind the scenes, used reference
counting so you never had the big GC sweep that some languages used,
worked great.  And super pleasant to not have to do all that memory
management.

Having the languages do more for you, and put up guard rails so people
can't make stupid mistakes, seems to be the way of the future.  It's 
not my future, I love C, it does what I want and I can live with what
it needs me to do to have working code.  But I'm a dinosaur and I 
know it.  I'm not trying to push C where people don't want it.
