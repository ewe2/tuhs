long story:

i have a friend with a phd in computer science.
his wife has a phd in chaucer.

i was having lunch with them when they were
opening a bank account and were discussing
what was to go on the checks.

she wanted "dr & dr X", he said he would let
her have her "dr", but insisted on "joe" -
she hit the ceiling, "dr & joe X" wouldn't do.
they both were very mad and "decided" on "dr
and mr X."

i am not sure what they put on the checks, but
the best part of the story is when they left.
they stomped out of the diner, very angry,
and bumped into someone coming in. the guy
coming in said "watch out asshole" and joe
replied without hesitation "that's dr asshole
to you."

another friend, this time by name, bob (h) morris,
would call me "boy" because he and i were the
only non-phds within several floors at the labs.

so, about dennis. he was always ambiguous about
the title. from that, i gather that, since he
put the time in, he wanted people to think he
had a phd. but he never used the title because
of the stigma around bell labs in so doing.

so i would drop this discussion about him, which
draws attention to the fact, leave it ambiguous
and just call him "dennis."
