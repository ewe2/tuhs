I seem to remember that at some point early on, we spent some of our
capital budget on buying another 16K bytes for the PDP-11.  As I
recall, the deal was that the OS got 8K and users got 8K.  I also
recall that that purchase was 20% of our capital budget for the
year...

Doug, did I remember this correctly?

 A self-imposed limit of 16K held in v1, and was quite fully utilized.
 When the iernel was rewritten in C, the limit (perhaps larger by
then)
 influenced the C compiler. More than one optimization was stimulated
 by the need to keep the kernel in bounds.
