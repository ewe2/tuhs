Donald ODana:

  already 20 years ago I met a guy (masters degree, university) who never
  freed dynamically allocated memory. He told me he is 'instantiating
  a object', but had no idea what an heap is, and what dynamically
  allocated memory means.

This is the sort of programmer for whom garbage collection was named:
his programs are a collection of garbage.
