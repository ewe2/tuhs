That would be some humorless git at Sun during the run-up to Solaris.
Luckily we are now protected against a recurrence by this warning in
the man page source:

.\" Take this out and a Unix Daemon will dog your steps from now until
.\" the time_t's wrap around.

And in the 64-bit world, that's a loooooooooooooooooooong time.
Someone should file a patch to restore warning and joke to illumos.
