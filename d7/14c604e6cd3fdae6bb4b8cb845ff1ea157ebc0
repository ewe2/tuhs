It probably should!  Emacs is very much divorced from the Unix
philosopy.  However, it's perfectly in synch with how things are done in
ITS.  I'd like to argue that if you use Emacs, you're actually using a
piece of ITS.

Yes, much like a Lisp machine.  Stallman worked on ITS and Lisp machines
before developing GNU Emacs (from Gosling's version), and it clearly
shows.

I happen to like ITS and Lisp, so Emacs is a perfect fit for me.
