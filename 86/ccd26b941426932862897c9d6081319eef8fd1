Yep; as I recall, the RFC line length is no more than 254 chars (I think), 
with no limit on the number of continuation lines.  Try connecting to my 
server at horsfall.org (I'll make you wait around 10 seconds), then check 
out my RFC-compliant banner...  I'll keep an eye out for you in my logs 
:-)

Check out www.horsfall.org/spamlog.pdf for a nice pretty graph; the 
rejects on "banner" is the purple one on the top; the "reject" line is the 
red one, and the "spam" line (stuff that gets through) is pink (for SPAM, 
geddit?).

Note that many of the "banner" violations are from woodpeckers i.e. they 
keep trying until they either give up or I notice (and firewall them).

The tools behind this are still a work in progress, so I don't currently 
log the number of "wait" violations etc (it was implemented fairly 
recently).

(And yes, my HTML programming sucks.)
