Even if there was support, it'd be just plain cruel, even with emulated
TU58's.  Reminds me of "The Wagner Ring Cycle on Convenient 45's".

	That wasn't too bad.  You should try Das Rheingold on 78's :)

The '94 is way cool! I'm amazed at the extensive menu-based boot ROM in 
this thing. At least the RA92's are quite a bit more 'civilized' than the
RA82 on my uVAX which is more like a howling banshee..

Pity I have little UNIBUS stuff.. Most of my other DEC hardware is QBUS based,
otherwise I wouldn't have had the problem.. I have an UC07 SCSI controller
I could use for a while (but it's QBUS) to hook up a tape drive.

The machine itself seems to work fine (and seems to be pretty much 'lodaded').
Runs RSX-11 now (at least a partial setup as I wasn't able to get all drives)

Any network connection will be OK.. I hope BSD has PPP support? That
should give at least some rudimentary network connectivity (even if it's
just 9600)

Worth a shot..

Or I could use 1 RA92 (with the problem you describe) and use it to 
run the install on the second drive? (partitioning that properly)

OK. Got that.

Guess my first search will be for either an UNIBUS SCSI controller or 
a TK50/TK70 controller as I still have some drives for those..

I have little or no 9-track reel tape stuff :-)

Thanx for the help!

							Bye, Arno.
