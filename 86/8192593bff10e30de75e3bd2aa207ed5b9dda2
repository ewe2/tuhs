Felt a little bored, so I started digging around some.

In the PDP-8/A mincomputer handbook 
(http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp8/handbooks/MinicomputerHandbook_1976.pdf), 
the desktop models are called MS800A, MS800B, MS880A and MS880B. But I 
know there is some manual that calls them DECsystem as well, but that 
might not be any document that has been scanned. I have paper copies of 
a lot of stuff somewhere in my cellar.

The COS-300/310 system reference manual is on Bitsavers 
(http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp8/cos-300/DEC-08-OCOSA-F_D_COS_300_310_System_Reference_Manual_Jul75.pdf). 
Reading through it, it's very clear that this is not OS/8, or any 
derivative of it. Check the file system details for example, the file 
name syntax (device is added after the filename, with a comma 
separator), various CUSPS like PIP, or the transfer program available to 
transfer files to/from OS/8.

I tried searching around more on COS-310, but only came up with other 
peoples memories (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3ADIBOL), but which 
also suggested that COS-310 came with the 8/e and later 8/a, including 
in a desktop config.

As for the EDUsystem thing, that must have been my brain. I can't find 
any connections. The EDUsystems were in fact having numbers like 10, 20, 
25, 30, 40 and 50. No 310 or anything close...
But EDUsystems do not really predate the 8/A. They carried on in the 
PDP-11 systems as well, beyond the 8/A era.
