: Well, my take on this is that C was developed with UNIX,
: of course, and UNIX early on decided to use a single
: character rather than a two-char (CRLF) sequence for
: end-of-lines.  So, since the CR was already in use for 
: the leading char in the two-char sequence, it made it a lot
: easier to use the LF character for the single newline, so
: programs wouldn't always have to be checking a second
: character...

Also, it is not possible to do overstriking w/o <BS> if you can't use
<CR> for the task.
