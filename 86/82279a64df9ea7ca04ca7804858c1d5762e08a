Well, it's a progression, isn't it?  As ideas are tried out, they are
used and then refined, and used and refined further. Multics did that
for its predecessors,  Unix did that for Multics, and Plan 9 did that
for Unix.  The key difference in Unix and Plan 9 from others being
the continual goal towards refinement through simplification.
