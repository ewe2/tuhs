I believe that I was the first to port Unix (V6) to the 11/34 in 
Australia; there should be a paper that I wrote, somewhere in the 
archives.  I was not aware of any prior work at the time, although 
subsequently a couple of bods came out to say that they'd beaten me to it 
(then why didn't they publish?).

In the words of the inimitable Tom Lehrer: "I publish first!".
