Ok,

another trivia question.

where did xargs come from? I started with Edition 7 (Perkin Elmer
V7 + bits of BSD 2.1) and I am pretty sure it wasn't there.

I have a feeling it was printed in a book as shell script, somthing
like Bourne's book, or Kernighan and Pike but I'am not sure.

Anyone remember?
