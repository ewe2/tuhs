The PDP-11/40 in the University of Toronto's Computer Research Facility
(CRF) had a GT-40, and the lead EE prof there loved the screen editor RT-11
provided for it. I never used it, but I was intrigued. (I did land the LM a
few times, though. More than a few.)

Across the raised floor aisle was the PDP-11/45, which ran Unix from 5PM to
8AM if I remember right, RT-11 the rest of the time, until some date around
1976 or 1977 (?), when Unix became an unstoppable force for innovation.
