Subject: [TUHS] "Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition, with Source"
Message-ID: <407B4411.9030506@peacemax.org>

To all concerned,
I decided to find out if the book were still available.
Per Dan Doernberg at Peer-To-Peer Communications:

>The "Lions' book" is temporarily out of stock;  we expect to 
>have it available in approximately 2-3 months.
>
>Background--- Peer-to-Peer Communications is the original 
>publisher of "Lions' Commentary on Unix", but we sold the book 
>to Annabooks/RTC Group in 1999. RTC decided not to reprint it 
>when they ran out of stock, so we took the publishing rights 
>back and are now working to make reprint arrangements.
>
>
>Sincerely,
>

>Customer Service
>Peer-to-Peer Communications Inc.
>service at peer-to-peer.com



Thank you,
James Falknor
