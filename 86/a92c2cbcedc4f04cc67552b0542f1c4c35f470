I was just discussing this with someone today, and I realized this 
information has fallen out of working memory, and I can't find it on 
secondary storage anywhere... ;-)

Does anyone remember the release history and version numbering of Ultrix 
for the VAX and MicroVAX (which I believe was referred to at various times 
as Ultrix-32 and Ultrix-32M, until some point when the "-32" thing was 
dropped, I think?)  I was trying to remember what the various released 
versions of Ultrix were.  The person I was discussing with thinks he 
remembers a version 1.4 and 1.6, before Ultrix 2.0.  I honestly don't 
remember any 1.x version beyond 1.2.  Is there a timeline somewhere?

--Pat.
