Do we have any people around who actively used Multics long enough to 
develop a feel for it?  My only experience is the printout that Rob 
Gingell had on his office door which was a description of Multics
paging in library after library before it actually ran the program.
I have no idea if it was that bad.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is if Multics had modern hardware
under it, performed well, would we want to be running it?
