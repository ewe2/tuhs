For me the nerd stage was a bit like the caterpillar whereas the hippy
stage was the butterfly. So you know, I'm a proud ex-nerd and a proud
ex-hippy, however I moved past both things a long time ago. If my kids
were to become nerds or hippies though, I would understand, since we
all need to make our own mistakes to move forward. As to the other
topic of Ron's post, well "small is beautiful" continues here, however
I find my ideas not gaining much currency on this forum. That could
be, because it's a historical forum rather than a "how to develop and
improve unix" forum. Or it could be, because people after using
something for a lifetime tend to take for granted a lot of the design
ideas in it.
cheers, Nick
