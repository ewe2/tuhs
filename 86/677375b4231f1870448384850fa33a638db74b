â€‹Well thank you!    I was on a trip and had stopped into a book store in
Cambridge, UK shortly after it was published and realized I was not going
to see it in the US anytime soon and certainly not in industry which is
where I was by then.   I said, hmmm, I better buy that while I can. So, I
did, and it has lived for years on my shelf in the basement.

Nice to have the official doc and the bits now too ;-)
