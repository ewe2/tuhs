Please refresh your memory and have a look at the sources...

The first of the two SunOS tables I am referring to is called "vfssw". I 
thought this was what he referred to. I thought that he knows that what Svr3 
used to have, did not make it into Svr4.


And BTW: Wikipedia is of low quality and unusable when something may be related 
to religion. Check e.g. how long it took to name Konrad Zuse as the inventor of 
the first usable computer. When I look at Wikipedia, I check whether the 
references are trustworthy before I believe the claims.
