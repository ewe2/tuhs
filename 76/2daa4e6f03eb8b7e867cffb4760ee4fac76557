    > There was no 635 at Project MAC, was there?

I seem to recall reading about one. And in:

  https://multicians.org/chrono.html

there's this entry: "08/65 GE 635 delivered to Project MAC". Clicking on the
'GE 635' link leads to "MIT's GE-635 system was installed on the ninth floor
of 545 Tech Square in 1965, and used to support a simulated 645 until the real
hardware was delivered."
