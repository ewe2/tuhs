I worked with Charles in the University of York. he's the guy who said
to me "how can it be simple, if the printout is half an inch thick"
about SMTP.

Charles also enjoyed himself: fancy dress, he had a full on Sun-King
court suit made, to go with his huge head of hair. This, in york, a
city of red-brick terraced houses, back-to-backs, and beer. Louis XIV
walking down t' road for a pint...

I think when he implemented streams in one or two pages of text from
the BLTJ article, and then sighed at the size of STREAMS when it came
to life.. says it all.  he was very very strong on a reductionist
'size matters' world view. His editor of choice in 1984 was ed, with a
command macro to repaint -22 + 22 about the . line.

(I hasten to add, Charles and I worked in totally different areas, and
I use the term "worked" in regards to myself with some trepidation)
