I love the picture of the nodes on the net.  I was told, by someone that I
don't remember, that uwisc was the 11th node on the net.  I bet it was
Larry Landweber https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Landweber who told
me that.  But I don't know.  If anyone can confirm or deny that I'd love
to know.

Either way, thanks for posting this, I think this is very on topic.
