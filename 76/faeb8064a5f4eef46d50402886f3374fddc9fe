It technically probably always should have.    Void* (which has the same
format as char*) would have accepted either type pointer, char* shouldn't,
though I suspect that early compilers that predate void* would have happily
converted any pointer to char* (or int for that matter).

I was about to suggest I'd yet to come across a compiler which handled them
that way, but on checking I find that both clang and gcc do now in effect
have 3 types.

i.e. both 'unsigned char *' and 'signed char *' values passed to a function
taking 'char *' raises a warning.

I wonder when they started doing that?
