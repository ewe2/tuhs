Ah, that brings back memories, though of a different hybrid computer:
EAI 640/3200 combination at CSIRO in Clayton, back in 1971.  I was too
junior in those days to understand all the details, but I do recall
that it was at least twice the size.

It didn't run Unix, though.  We programmed the digital side in some
FORTRAN dialect that included scaled fractions (integers with the
decimal point at the left).
