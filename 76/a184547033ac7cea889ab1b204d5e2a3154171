RedHat, Ubuntu, any of the major distributions.  Heck, Knoppix is fine.
Arch is an outlier, it's not trying to be easy to install for boomers.

All of the major Linux distros have made this point and click painless
(and see my other post, they all work just fine without a mouse in a
point and click world).  FreeBSD hasn't updated their install process
in decades.  It is literally stepping back to the 4BSD era.  Painless,
it ain't.
