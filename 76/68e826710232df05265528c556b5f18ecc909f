Kulp did the signal work in the kernel and added the code to the c shell
to use it (or had Eric Cooper, who was working for him as a student at
the time do fg/bg). He did his work on 3BSD and set the mods to Berkeley,
where Joy took them and integrated them into 4.1 BSD.

As far as I can tell, Kulp has always gotten credit for doing the initial
work, Joy for the `standard' BSD integration, and David Korn for doing
the second (non-csh) implementation.
