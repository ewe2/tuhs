Do you know who wrote the /sys/src/games/blit emulator?
There's a piece of code in it that I had to comment out that
I dont understand and I want to ask about it:

        }
-       write(3, rom, sizeof(rom));
+    /* I dont know what this was for, but it spews garbage
+     * out telnet to the vax, causing it to hang.
+     */
+       //write(3, rom, sizeof(rom));
 }

I'm not sure what fd 3 is intended to be, but its the telnet socket in p9p.
