My own email works fine with it as-is, it shows a "reply to list" button
based on, I assume, the List-Post header.

I'd worry that changing the Reply-To header to be the list would (in
addition to obliterating the original reply-to for the odd poster that
has it distinct from their from address) make the "reply to sender"
button go to the list and force people to copy the address manually.
