The 'problem' is with the de driver...Basically SIMH flags something wrong
with all incoming packets, and the driver thinks they are all corrupt...

in the procedure derecv

                   if ((rp->r_flags &
(RFLG_ERRS|RFLG_FRAM|RFLG_OFLO|RFLG_CRC))||
                       (rp->r_flags&(RFLG_STP|RFLG_ENP)) !=
(RFLG_STP|RFLG_ENP) ||
                       (rp->r_lenerr & (RERR_BUFL|RERR_UBTO|RERR_NCHN)) ||
                       len < ETHERMIN || len > ETHERMTU) {

something here is being passed wrong.. I've just changed the statement to
if(1==2) to keep the logic flow...

Anyways the same issue cropped up with 4.2 BSD & the VAX 11/780

On my pdp-11 the ini I'm using is:

set cpu 11/94 4M
set cpu cis
set cpu idle
set xu ena
att xu slirp
;attach tm0 211bsd.tap
attach tm0 ircii-4.4.source.tap
set rp0 rp06
attach rp0 auto.dsk
set rq dis
set rk dis
set rl dis
set hk dis
set rx dis
set tq dis
set dz lines=8
att dz 1000
boot rp0

I'm also using a version of SIMH that I've replaced the libpcap with SLiRP
from Qemu.. It's basically a user mode ip stack to do NAT.  The advantage is
that they always have the same ip address, and it doesn't
require escalated privileges to run.
