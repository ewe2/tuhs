​Sorry - yes, force of habit of many years ago, ​

​   I suppose I should be happy that my fingers did not call the Perq by
it's sometimes (CMU) name, the "PascAlto."​   A number of my friends and
colleagues in those days made money by working over there.

That said, I do miss the GPD - aka the Graphics Wonder which was, IMHO,
their best product.   A vector graphics system with a dedicated PDP-11.
Some of the coolest programs I ever ran on the CMU PDP-10's displayed on
the "GDPs."   I still have a technical manual for it and have had a private
dream of trying to put it into simh to try to resurrect some of those old
codes (ah yes -- something else for my retirement "bucket list" - real work
gets in the way).
