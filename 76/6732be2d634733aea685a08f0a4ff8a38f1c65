I have a QIC-150 cartridge of Motif 1.2.1 (labeled "patch release", so
perhaps not a complete source tree?) but do not have a working drive that
will read it.  I attempted to contact Al Kossow about reading it but was
unsuccessful.  If you would be able to read it I would be happy to send it
to you.
