I ran my own server for bsdimp.com and village.org form the early 90s until
2009 or so. I switched to gmail when I was seriously looking at dropping
$10k for a server that had enough horse power to filter the 50k-75k spam I
was getting a month at that time. Switching to google was easier and I
didn't have to spend the $10k nor the 4 hours a week on the care and
feeding of the black lists, etc.
