?? We ran dialup modems on our DZ11s (1200 bps Vadics, IIRC) with no problems,
so you must be speaking only some sort of high-speed application where you
needed the hardware flow control, or something, when you say "running modems
... did not work".

Although, well, since the board didn't produce an interrupt when a modem
status line (e.g. 'carrier detect') changed state, we did have to do a kludge
where we polled the device to catch such modem control line changes. Maybe
that's what you were thinking of?

To prevent giving an incorrect impression to those who 'were not there', each
single DZ hex board supported 8 lines (fully independent of any other cards);
the full DH replacement did need two boards, though.
