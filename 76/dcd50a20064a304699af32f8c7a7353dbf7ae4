Indeed. Even the mid-90's Peer-to-Peer press reprinting appears to be,
roughly, a facsimile of line printer output. I say 'roughly' because there
is some prefatory material at the beginning that is properly typeset:
dedications, acknowledgements, etc, all written at the time of
(re)publication and similarly a set of "appreciations" at the end.

Interestingly, the title page appears to be approximately original and is
typeset. It also includes this little gem of a note: "COPY NO. 050B  NAME
PROPERTY OF BELL LABORATORIES, INC. COPY TO BE RETURNED TO: COMPUTING
INFORMATION SERVICE MH 2F-128 UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM SOURCE CODE VERSION 6"
(line breaks elided).

I don't think I've ever seen a copy of the original; I suspect the title
page was reset for the PP publication, though it is of course possible that
Lions could have prepared that specially: doing a "one-off" for a single
page, perhaps under contract with an actual publishing company or graphic
artist or something, would have been reasonable while the rest of the
booklet contents were taken from listings.
