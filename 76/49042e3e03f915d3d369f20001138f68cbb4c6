Subject: [Unix-jun72] slight tools cleanup
Message-ID: <Pine.BSI.4.64.0805040852430.20114@malasada.lava.net>

I reorganized the build process slightly.  Hopefully this won't affect
anyone and everything will keep working as before.   I basically
took the 'sed' hacks out of assemv7 and made the "rebuild" script do
the patching with proper patch files instead.  There is now a patches
directory with all of the patches we are using and comments on what
they do and why.
