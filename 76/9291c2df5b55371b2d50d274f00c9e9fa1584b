​It was all pretty contemporary in my view. I suspect CTSS was first and
the others picked up the idea from there. Univac EXEC-8 called them
'symbiants' as I recall, and I think TSS used the term 'system tasks' but
we did refer to them as daemons also. Of course, I saw them called daemons
on TOPS and UNIX around the same time and never really made a big deal one
way or the other; again I think because we used the term on the IBM systems
sometimes.
