Subject: [TUHS] origins of void*
Message-ID: <201711060037.vA60bGA2090787@tahoe.cs.Dartmouth.EDU>

As has been explained, void came from Algol 68 via Steve Bourne.
As no object could be declared void, void* was a useless
construct. A kind of variable that could point to any object
was required to state the type of useful functions like qsort.
To avoid proliferation of keywords, the useless void* was
pressed into service. I do not remember who suggested that.
