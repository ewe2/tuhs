Marc,

the first I.T. Recession in Australia occurred in 1991.
It was the first economic recession where corporates couldn=E2=80=99t =
easily save money by =E2=80=9Cautomating=E2=80=9D - all the low-hanging =
fruit - like Inventory, Payroll & Accounting - had been computerised, at =
least by companies that=E2=80=99d survive.

Thanks for mentioning the IBM OCO - I=E2=80=99d left mainframe by then.

Your insight about the =E2=80=99social contract=E2=80=99 ring true - =
never heard that before.
Since that first recession, the regard managers have for I.T. / =
Computing staff - embodied in wages & conditions - has declined markedly =
outside business where software & systems are their business.
The hype and over-expenditure on Y2K, then the Dot Crash, resulted in a =
5 year I.T. recession in Australia - and a very jaded attitude towards =
I.T. and their budgets within the Corporates I know.

The deskilling and mediocre work of programmers and support staff alike =
doesn=E2=80=99t seem to improve whole-of-enterprise productivity.

Your summation of the Professional response to the dissolution of the =
=E2=80=99social contract=E2=80=99 is very insightful. Explains the rapid =
rise and proliferation of OSS in the 1990=E2=80=99s.
