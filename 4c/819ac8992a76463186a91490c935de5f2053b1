Meanwhile I found out myself that I have to run syschk and that the
system asks for single or multi user mode after syschk. I was able to
remove the root passwd but didn't get much further. The file system
needs to be repaired and I have no stand alone utilities. But only the
stand alone syschk is able to repair the file system.

Interresting that the machine in the mail archive above has a /73 CPU. I
have a spare /73 CPU module so I may be able to upgrade my machine...
