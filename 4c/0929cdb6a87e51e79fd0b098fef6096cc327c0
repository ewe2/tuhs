As a long time UUCP person on PDP-11's, "Danger Will Robinson."

Just for grins and giggles on the V7/PDP-11 side, try it over a DH  (VH
driver in simh) emulation (or even a KL/DL - although the
simulated interrupts will be a mother).  That said, the VH driver is a not
exactly a DH as I understand it, its the later QBUS version which was
similar but different.   It's been on my list of things I want to chase
down at some point to make work to get it closer to the original.

FYI: Running UUCP over real DZ's was always troublesome.  There were a ton
of updates/patches done post the original V7 release in the DZ drivers to
make them play better.   Most of us that ran large UUCP set up in the old
days, installed ABLE DMAX (DH/DM) that were a single board DH replacement -
they are DMA, and buffered (and supported proper modem control which the
DZ's don't - although later UCB work on the driver sort of faked it enough
to make to it work for basic dial-up use reasonably reliably).
