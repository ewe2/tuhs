Subject: [TUHS] Kernel built under V1
Message-ID: <200805181433.HAA01780@mist.magic.com>

For fun, I tried building the kernel under V1 and booting it and it
looks like it simply works.

I did the following, outside the simulator:

	tools/assemv2
	mkdir fs/usr/kernel
	cp -pi build/u?.s fs/usr/kernel
	tools/imgbuild
	boot/installboot
	tools/pdp11 boot/simh.cfg

Then, I logged in as root and did:

	chdir /usr/kernel
	as u?.s
	chdir ../boot
	sh run
	msys2 u ../kernel/a.out

More realistically, the kernel should be built in /usr/sys.
