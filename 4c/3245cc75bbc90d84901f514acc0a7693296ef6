The "statute of limitations" must have passed long ago, so I confess to
having been the author of the original tac (cat in reverse). I was working
on a project that wrote log files, but the logs were very "bursty". Minutes
might go by without any activity, followed by a burst of logging activity.
We often wanted to see *the most recent* burst of activity, so "tail -f"
wouldn't do the job. It would show the *next* burst of activity, which
might not occur for quite some time. Somebody posted a functional
equivalent on some netnews group, but it was *ghastly*. I think it did
seeks of -1 characters at a time to accumulate each line. That would have
been fast enough to feed our pathetic 1200 baud terminals, but it would
have beat the system to death, and that would have been a disservice to
other users. My version did reads of 512 bytes on 512-byte boundaries, so
it put much less load on the system. I couldn't bear to see something like
the netnews version
get adopted. The software release process at the Labs was a bureaucratic
nightmare, so I "tossed my version over the wall", into the arms of Andy
Tanenbaum, as I recall. He made it public, attributed to "an unknown
author".

I don't know how Rob Pike got ahold of it, but he recognized that mailbox
files had the same bursty growth. Unlike our log files, whose contents were
acceptably understandable in reverse order, mail messages were hard to read
in reverse order, so he proposed making it possible to recognize the
headers at the start of each mail message, and put the entire message out
in readable order. I think that was a useful option, but the irony of Rob
adding an option to "tac" was hard to overlook.

The version out there now was rewritten by Jay Lepreau, it seems:

/*
 * tac.c - Print file segments in reverse order
 *
 * Original line-only version by unknown author off the net.
 * Rewritten in 1985 by Jay Lepreau, Univ of Utah, to allocate memory
 * dynamically, handle string bounded segments (suggested by Rob Pike),
 * and handle pipes.
 */

Dynamic buffer allocation rather than relying on the time-honored
512-bytes-is-enough assumption was a positive, as was supporting Rob's
suggestion. Handling pipes strikes me as a waste of code, but hey, anything
is better than that version I replaced.
