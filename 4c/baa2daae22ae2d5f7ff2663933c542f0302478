Init works now provided you edit the "itab" appropriately.  If you
change the first entry to "'8: .." and comment out all the rest it
will spawn a tty on /dev/tty8 which is an alias for /dev/tty.  If
you leave in other tty entries, the system will respond much more
slowly, will print a login prompt, but then become unresponsive.
Possibly the kernel has some tty handling bugs still present or
doesn't like running without the DC11 hardware present?
