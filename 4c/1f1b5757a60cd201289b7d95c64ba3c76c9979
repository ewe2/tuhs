That is your opinion.  Mine happens to differ.  I think we're both 
adults and can agree to disagree.

I feel like DMARC is just the latest technology / technique that is 
causing ripples in the pond.  -  I seem to remember similar ripples when 
SPF, and DKIM to a lesser degree, were introduced became more popular.

I believe DMARC does have value, and will have more value in the short 
to mid-term future.

I acknowledge the perceived negative value of DMARC.  I expect that 
other anti-spam techniques caused similar perceptions over the years.

  - Closing open relays
  - Requiring reverse DNS
  - SPF
  - DKIM
  - DMARC
  - ARC (possibly in the future)

I understand why people may want to push back on such technologies.  I 
feel like they are free to have their opinion.  I'll try to keep my 
opinion to myself.

However, I suspect that the horse drawn carriages are going to 
eventually end up yielding to the automobile in most places.

This is exactly why I've been working with Warren to try to make sure 
that I (and others using DMARC like me) don't cause harm to the TUHS 
community.

I do believe that's the current industry accepted work around.  -  I 
don't know if it's the proper thing to do or not.  -  I suspect it's 
what I'm going to end up asking Warren to enable.  (It's my 
understanding that the mailing list manager that Warren is using already 
has the knob, and that he just needs to turn it.)
