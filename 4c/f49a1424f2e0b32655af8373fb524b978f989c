Should work fine with the 4.3 template tape... But I would save the original kernel
just in case

I moved binaries from the older 4.3 to Reno and uWisc without problems. 

Ftp works.  I wish I could get lynx and wet to build.

I don't know how close 4.3UWisc is (in terms of config files etc.) to
valilla 4.3BSD, but you might be able to untar the 4bsd-uucp customisation
tarball over the top of 4.3UWisc. That would get you the ftp binary with
PASV on by default, and the de0 interface set up with a working NAT IP
address. Then you could set up a local ftp server on another box.

I'm nearly out the door for a week's break else I'd try it out.
Cheers, Warren
