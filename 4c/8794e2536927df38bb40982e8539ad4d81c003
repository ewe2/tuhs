Yes, I remember doing CMU pppd v1.4 or so on SunOS v4.x in the
1991-1994 time period. SL/IP was more prevelent because it was easier to find devices doing it.

Version 2.x of the package started adding support into Linux/*BSD when they started appearing.

I don't think the current repo (https://ppp.samba.org/) has much of the earlier v1.x history.
