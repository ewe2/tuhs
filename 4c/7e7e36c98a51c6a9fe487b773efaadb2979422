Subject: [TUHS] ken: # of children?
Message-ID: <20110728113109.GA13578@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, apologies for these seemingly random questions. How many children does
Ken Thompson have? I want to use the phrase that Unix was "Ken's other child",
but it would be inaccurate if he had several real children.

Thanks,
	Warren
