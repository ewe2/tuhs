Because you need LK421 UNIX keyboard[1] for those.  Pretty rare these days,
but I have several of them in NOS quality stashed, just in case one of them
breaks.

My personal favorite is definitely VT220 -- very "modern" shape, small and
portable even for todays standards (12" tube), and the built-in font is
just perfect.  Did I mention beautiful scanlines?  You won't find them on
PC CRT monitors.
