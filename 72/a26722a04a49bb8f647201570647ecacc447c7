I'm not unfamiliar with the studies.  Most are focus on speed of reading
which is not necessarily the most important thing in code.  Some studies
have found that things that are easier to read are read less accurately
which might be OK when reading a novel but is not necessarily optimal for
code.

Me, I try not to be dogmatic or to read what I want into studies.  Well
written long lines trump cryptic short lines for me.  Your mileage may
vary.
