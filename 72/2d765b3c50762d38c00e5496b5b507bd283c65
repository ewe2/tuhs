Larry,

I have been out of working (retired from AT&T Labs Research in 2013), let
alone working on SCCS and related tools for quite a while.
I'm happy to hear that some folks appreciated what I called "INEX" (for
include/exclude); one of my contributions to SCCS.
I've had to argue against RCS and, of course, deal with CVS, much to my
chagrin.
Are you familiar with the concept of SCCS ID lists (slists), which act as a
table of contents of a "unit" (usually a library or load module)?
Not much released (from the Labs) documentation on slists; one paper was
way back in COMSAC 80 by three former co-workers: Gene Cristofor, Tim Wendt
and Bud Wonsiewicz.

Alan

P.S. Sounds like I should learn more about BitKeeper.
