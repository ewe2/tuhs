Seconded. I'd love to get my hands on it as well.

When I let my fascination with computers derail my BA(Classics) in 1991, I was told the OS choices 
included Unix - BSD naturally - but only if I could pony up a king's ransom to pay for an unused AT&T 
license. I wanted Sun because of the cool factor, but couldn't afford a workstation so I went with a PC, 
and the cost of downloading Linux or 386BSD correlated to the cost of floppies, and Linux was 
marginally cheaper, so Linux won. My copy of SLS is now on the Bochs images page.

I found a Sun 68000 pizza box at a computer recycling place in 2002, but the cool had evaporated by 
then. But I'd still like to get my hands on the SunOS source. Who should we contact?
