The trick would be to find a computer that not only has dialable modems
(there are several such ISPs out there, like AOL, EarthLink, and NetZero),
but also allows callers access to a command line.  Normally you get
only PPP service, which just allows you to send and receive IP packets,
of no use to a TTY.

But there may be some hobbyist systems out there with dialup access.
