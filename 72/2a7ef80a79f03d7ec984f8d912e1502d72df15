Aside for entertainment purposes: at one point, the root
password for the UNIX systems I ran in the Caltech High
Energy Physics group was derived from Al's name, but through
a level of punning indirection.  I believe Mark Bartelt
came up with it.

Later we decided to change it.  I believe I chose the
successor, which continued the UNIX-licensing scheme, but
in a different direction:

	*UiaTMoBL

The systems that had either of these passwords are long-
since turned off.
