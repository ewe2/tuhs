It's up and running.  It requires the KE11 fix that Brad made (so that
switch registers work).  I tested against that and can boot without
pre-loading core with anything other than the 32W bootstrap.  It pulls
the bootstrap (bos) and operating system from the high portion of the
RF11 image.

I'll upload this this evening.
