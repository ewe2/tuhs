That makes a lot of sense. When there was a name, it was preserved, but a
huge amount of the sources had nothing at all in the source files to
identify it. One big area of contribution was into the kernel where the
options sometimes contained the name of where the code came from. In the
2BSD kernels we see eg TEXAS_AUTOBAUD, MENLO_OVLY, MENLO_KOV, MENLO_JCL,
MPX_FILS, CGL_RTP and a bunch of UCB_ names. It's clear the non UCB ones
came from elsewhere, but there's no info on where they came from (they are
documented in setup.5 at least so I know what they are). So given the
sparseness of the early marking for provenance, the coments make more sense
and give a better timeframe to it.
