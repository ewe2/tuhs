Subject: [pups] Looking for binary distribution of v7
Message-ID: <3DD561FF00000045@mail.epost.de> (added by postmaster@mail.epost.de)

Hello,
I just read the instructions of how to boot a binary version 7 disk image
on a ersatz11 pdp11 emulator.
The links pointing to the 'unix_v7_rl.dsk' image I found are dead ... :-(
Are there any other sites where I can download this binary distribution ??

BTW their are disk dumps of version 7 in the Caldera ancient unix archive
. is it possible to boot
them on ersatz11 as well ? I tried it a few times without success ...
I simply tried it with the following e11.ini (from a newsgroup discussion),
because I heavily lack
PDP 11 hardware knowledge. Nevertheless trying this ini-file and many
variations I made of it all
end up in a blank emulator screen ...

Any ideas will be appreciated
