Hi,buddies
 
  Nice to meet you all.I am a new comer from ChengDu,China.I am very
interested in Unix and PDP an now I am reading the book <Lions'
Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition with Source Code> ,which make me so
excited.It's indeed an great book for me to understand the principle and
detail of the UNIX, however, I am a  self-learner without chance to
discuss with others around me, so I am glad to join you and have a
chance to learn from all of you. Thanks!
 
Best Regards
 Tian Wen
