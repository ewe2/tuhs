I wouldn't be so sure that claim should stand uncontested, given that
PC-DOS 2.0 (long before Windows) largely copied the concept of
directories from UNIX. Just think how wonderful Windows would be if it
was running on top of a file system that lacked the concept of
directories.

Then again IIRC the original Macintosh file system had no concept of
directories, but they somehow faked them in software. Makes you wonder
why they went through all that trouble instead of implementing
_proper_ support for directories/folders/filing cabinets/drawers/etc.
