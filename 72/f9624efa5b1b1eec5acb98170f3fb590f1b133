I'd like to begin by thanking folks for their suggestions.  I'd also =
like to express my awe and appreciation for Nelson Beebe's bibliographic =
work.  That said, I am not now (and will likely never be) in a position =
to do anything similar for the documents in question, let alone scan and =
OCR them, etc.  If someone wants to take on such a project, please let =
me know.

However, as a small step along the way, I opened up the box and produced =
a rough list of the contents (see below).  When I noticed version or =
date information, I noted it, but many of the documents are missing that =
sort of thing.  So, YMMV.

It appears that most of the items are copies of Unix Version 7 =
documents, printed at UC Berkeley (UCB).  Some of the rest are a mix of =
photocopied articles from magazines (e.g., BSTJ, BYTE, Comm. ACM, =
Software--Practice and Experience).  I assume that most of this content =
is readily available, but some may not be.  In any case, the =
bibliographic info might be useful.=20

Finally, there are assorted documents that were edited or produced at =
UCB.  Some of these (especially the ones marked DRAFT) may be of =
historical interest.  Anyway, please let me know if any of this sounds =
like it might be worth passing along...

-r

P.S.  Careful Reader may notice a strong emphasis on text processing in =
this collection.  Jim's research interests included the use of computers =
to analyze Middle English poetry.  For example, the rhyme schemes =
allowed him to clarify the pronunciation of certain words.


# Notes

The documents are currently stored in manilla folders in a cardboard =
box.
Folders are separated by bars (---) in the List.
Folders are listed below in the order found in the box.

Dates and "UNX x.y.z" notations are transcribed, when available.
These notations appear to relate to UCB's "UNIX Documentation Guide".
