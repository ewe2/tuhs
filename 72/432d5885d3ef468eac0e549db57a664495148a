This is tangential perhaps, but, having been at Edinburgh in the (late) =
1980s and 1990s -- I met Donald Michie a couple of times and I think my =
wife was taught by your father -- I wonder if anyone is properly  =
writing down (I mean, writing book(s) about) the history of electronic =
computing, and AI in particular, in the UK?  Although (almost?) all the =
first generation of people must be gone now, there must be many people =
who knew them well &/or were their students.  But in due course there =
won't be and all the first-hand information will be gone.  It probably =
wasn't really *possible* to write it down in a sensible way until the BP =
stuff became public because so much of the early part would have made no =
sense ('how did so many people know what to do?'), but there's a window =
when it is possible to make sense of it, which is probably still open =
now but will close.

If there are good books on this I'd be interested.
