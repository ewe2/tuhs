I can confirm your memory. I was involved in a demo of one round about
1983. It was an ICE, but I forget which processors it supported. TEK4105
terminal (first time I saw one of those). It did, indeed, run Unix on a
PDP-11, but I forget the details. Only saw it once, and I quit working 
for that company within six months of the demo; don't know whether they 
wound up buying any.
