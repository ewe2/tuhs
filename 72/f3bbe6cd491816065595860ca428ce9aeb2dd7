Hi Larry,

Rather than work out the coordinates of everything, could pic punt some
of that downstream to troff by producing expressions which rest on
variables set by troff to, say, the width of a diversion.  The order of
evaluation presented to troff would obviously have to be topological on
the dependencies which bars cycles.  It would add elasticity to a
drawing.

The other approach would be a multi-pass effort where pic initially
assumes unknown dimensions, like some text's width, but also outputs
troff which will store the actual width for input to pic on future runs.

Cheers, Ralph.
