We lost the Father of Computing, Alan Turing, on this day when he suicided 
in 1954 (long story).  Just imagine where computing would've been now...

Yes, there are various theories surrounding his death, such as a jealous 
lover, the FBI knowing that he knew about Verona and could be compromised 
as a result of his sexuality, etc.  Unless they speak up (and they ain't), 
we will never know.

Unix reference?  Oh, that...  No computable devices (read his paper), no 
computers...  And after dealing with a shitload of OSs in my career, I 
daresay that there is no more computable OS than Unix.  Sorry, penguins, 
but you seem to require a fancy graphical interface these days, just like 
Windoze.
