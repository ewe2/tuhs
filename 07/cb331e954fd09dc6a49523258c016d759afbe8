It probably depends on what your Solaris 8 source license says. I can't
remember offhand the terms of the Solaris Foundation Source Program which
provided it under non-disclosure terms, but it wouldn't surprise me if
they stated that you only got access to Solaris 8, not to ancestor SV
code.

Your license should tell (mine is at home now) but I suspect it will be
highly restricted.
