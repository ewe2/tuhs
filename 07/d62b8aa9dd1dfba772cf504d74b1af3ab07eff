Subject: [TUHS] OK, time to step back from the keyboard (for a bit)

Goodness, I go to sleep, wake up 8 hours later and there's 50 messages in
the TUHS mailing list. Some of these do relate to the history of Unix, but
some are getting quite off-topic.

So, can I get you all to just pause before you send in a reply and ask:
is this really relevant to the history of Unix, and does it contribute
in a meaningful way to the conversation.

Looks like we lost Armando, that's a real shame.

Cheers, Warren
