on the commenting subject, and as it was Shannon’s anniversary recently... i always felt information theory relates well to comments.

i.e. repeating anything i can see from the code (like “returns void”) tells me nothing.

telling me something non-obvious (“allocate one more for end of list sentinel”)  really helps.
