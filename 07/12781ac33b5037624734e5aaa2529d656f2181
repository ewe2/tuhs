While working at the Biomedical Research Institute (Madrid, Spain) I got a
quote from DEC for access to Ultrix source code. As I remember it, it wasn't
that expensive (~1000$ for an academic license) and I mused bout acquiring 
it for some time. My naïvete at the time prevented me from ordering it (that
and the availability of BSD sources).

But I'd feel pretty sure that at that price many source licenses must have
been sold. Maybe there are still copies lying around and you can find 
someone to send you a copy back.

Sure, it would be nicer to maintain the whole development log and versions.
