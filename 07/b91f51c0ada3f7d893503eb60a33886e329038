If you want to do more of an apples to apples comparison, you
should pick a brand new problem not known to be solved in
either C or Lisp so that both sides start at the same point!

I do think that if you consider just the raw performance as
the sole metric, C will almost always win.  After all it is
sort of a portable assembly language & you can compile
programs in most language to C. But in the real world many
other factors matter too.  So to make the contest a bit more
fair, you should put a time limit on the effort.
