Subject: [TUHS] PDF of "A Quarter Century of Unix"
Message-ID: <20160118042438.GA22535@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, I asked Peter Salus if there is an electronic version of his great
book "A Quarter Century of Unix". There isn't one, so I scanned my book
in. Peter has given TUHS the right to distribute the scanned version.

I've just added a link to the PDF of the scan here:

But, if you can, buy the paper version as well!

Many thanks to Peter for his generosity.

Cheers, Warren
