For my 11/34A with 2 RL01 I made with an emulator a bootable V7-RL01-diskimage.
I downloaded it under RT-11 with KSERVE from John Wilson (dunno where I
ftped it) over a serial line onto the second disk. It took some hours,
but it worked.

How did you write it to the RL01 and what would it take to write it to rl02
assuming rt/kserve.  Did you use guarenteed no bad block media?

If the need is large enough, I can roll out a TU77 and connect it to Magica
to read the stuff. That means Sweden, though...

Well, not day one, but that come pretty early. Quality of the magnetic
media wasn't really that good back then, so you usually *had* to
expect a few bad spots on any disk.

On PDP-11's, I would supect that Unix went with DEC's BAD144 standard
pretty fast. (When did that standard come, btw?)

Not to be a pain in the ass or so, but in what ways was Unix ahead of
anything?

Unix was just a small hack inspired by Multics, and looking at contemporary
operating systems, I'd say there were some that were way ahead of Unix (and
still are...)

Operating systems in the last twenty years have really retro-developed. :-)

Most RL02 are pretty good. Usually they don't have any bad spots in my
experience.

yes, but as hacks go it was more public in code than other OSs of value in

multics.  My experience in chronological order is OS/8, TOPS-10, CP/M-80,
NS*dos<z80>, RT-11, RSTS, RSX-11, VMS, Ultrix.  So those are what I have to 
look at when thinking in terms of 1970s OSs like Unix of the time.

If you mean what I think the answer is not here.  If anything my view is 
more of when will dos/winders perform as well as some of those OSs of the

No exacly invisible... The operating system had to be aware of the bad spots,
and invent some scheme or other to hide the spots from the user.

OS/8's solution is rather hairy. I know, since I didn't have a "formatter"
program, so I needed to write one, given the source of the device driver...

Bad spots on MSCP disks on the other hand are totally invisible.

Oh, certainly, the source was available. I would say that that, along
with the fact that you got it for free, were the only two reasons for
its rise to fame.

If you compare Unix with the systems you mention above, most of the
DEC stuff have had some stuff since the '70s that Unix only got in the
90s... (Shared libraries and microkernels for instance.)

What I meant was that development have gone backwards with regards to
operating systems in the last twenty years. :-)
Who knows how many things Microsoft has reinvented in the last few
years, and Unix hasn't been much better either...

(Okay, so this is the list for Unixes on the PDP-11, so I'll defend
that particualr Unix. It's still clean and mean, which was the purpose
of the design, and not the overbloated monster called Unix
nowadays...)

Re Heriot-Watt stripped-down 7th Edition...

I did once attempt to read the tape on our department's Kenedy drive
(now disposed of) and managed to get all but a few blocks near the
beginning.  It seems to be a pretty standard distribution tape, with a
layout as described in the Unix Programmer's Manual Vol.2 (Jan.1979).

I have a 1600bpi copy (modulo the bad blocks) somewhere (I wonder where
I put it?).  I wouldn't bother about making another copy; if anyone
deparately wants to try, I guess I might loan the original.  But AFAIK
there's only a couple of Makefiles that differ, and I have those on the
RL02s.  

I don't have any version of kermit that will run under 7th Edition on
an 11/23 (the normal versions are too big), but text files are perfectly
easy to copy.

Yes. Very unfortunate too.  Good design is far more rare.

Somehow I find that to be the central point.  I apply the same rule to CP/M

Fully thing there is a groups doing an embedded linux kernal (ELKS) and 
they act like doing it on a 16bit machine is majik and something like a
z80 means far to stripped to be of use. Seems they missed the point.

I ran kserve on RT-11 and kermit on my PC (and a 4-wire seriell line
in between). kserve (unlike the other kermits for RT-11) can write directly
with a put to a disk. The RL01 disk pack I used had no bad blocks. This
should the same way work with RL02 disks. In some blocks on the disk pack
should be written, if it has bad blocks. But I don't know which. I didn't
try it with media with bad blocks, because I had only this disk pack free.
(On the other is the RT-11 and my third has a red shock watch.)

There are a few good tricks to get PDP11 with odd configurations to load. The
first is the venerable paper tape bootstrap. It consists of only 8 instructions
(28 bytes) and works on serial ports. It then loads the 'absolute loader'
which will load formatted data (paper tape!). The format is trival
and has checksums and stop/transfer blocks. The trick is to convert the
unix secordary boot loader from V7 or BSD 2.9-2.11 and then you have
mini loader with lots of device drivers. I can provide some of these
programs including the paper tape listings and images (heck, I still have
a working paper tape reader/punch). You can load ANY PDP-11 this way!

Another approach if you have any of the LSI-11 based cpus with microcoded
console emulator is to use the Xinu suite. It does an initial bootstrap
by sending console commands and then loading a binary boostrap.

On the subject of bad blocks, V6 and V7 offered no bad block strategies.
The DEC spec for RK05's was 200 tracks by 12 sectors by 2 surface plus 3
bad block tracks for 4800 blocks plus 72 spare. The media was generally pretty
good, and all Unix versions used 4872 block filesystems. Files-11 (IAS/RSX) was
the only system to offer bad block replacement (I cannot be sure for RSTS).
When bigger disk drives started showing up, like the RM02/3's and RM05, the
usual practive was to buy packs with 'zero' defects.

The tu58 is also short and can load any program with code in block 0
(default boot block).  the tu58 can also simulate a console driving ODT.
The best part if TU58 is serial interface and can be hooked up to any 
unix/linux/dos/cpm/Whatever box that has a serial port.

Well, transparent or system based the blocks are allocated.  CP/M does not 
do block replacement but utilities can mark bad blocks by allocating them, 
or revector them at the hardware level.  I believe mkfs does this.  Some 
disks like the RQDXn do this at the hardware level.
