Grant,

You've just described a useful piece of old ARPANET hardware: the Advanced =
Communications Corp (ACC) Error Control Unit (ECU). ARPANET IMP 1822 (serial) =
interface could be "local host" (30 feet, unbalanced serial), or "distant =
host" (up to 2,000 feet, balanced serial).

One used a pair of ACC ECUs - one at the IMP end, one at the host end, with =
potentially arbitrary distance inbetween the ECUs, so as to obviate the 1822 =
LH/DH limits.

I managed such a setup at LLNL in 1986 (MILNET, IMP #21): when I was hired, =
the group I hired into (well, put under contract to by CDC Professional =
Services) was on-site at the lab, but as the wires ran between the old AEC =
instrument trailer that was our machine room for a VAX-11/780 and PDP-11/70 =
(both running BSD, natch) and the Magnetic Fusion Energy Computer Center (MFE =
CC) where the IMP was located was rather longer than 1822 DH could handle.

A 3002 circuit ("dry" pairs) and a pair of LADDS high-speed modems did the =
trick there.

Later, my group moved to the Hacienda Business Park in Pleasanton, some miles =
away; we set up a Pac*Bell 56Kb/s (DS0) leased line with standard CSU/DSUs to =
connect the ACC ECUs and in turn the host (well, router) to our port on the =
IMP. I had some trouble getting that one going again because the ACC ECU =
manuals were ... disjoint: simple recipies for setting DIP switches (with no =
explanation of why), and a complete schematic in the back, which was useless =
to me because I'm not an EE, but the documented switch settings for our desired =
setup didn't work. ACC sent two engineers to our site from Santa Barbara to =
solve the problem - the senior one was the last engineer to issue an =
Engineering Change Order (ECO) on the ECUs.

To bring this back to a Unix context, that sort of "spoofers in the middle" =
was also the shtick of Telebit Trailblazer modems for the UUCP "g" protocol =
in UUCP/USENET days - 19.2Kb/s in one direction at a time, and the modems =
"knew" the "g" protocol and spoofed it for maximum speed in one direction, =
which was the way UUCP worked too: file transfers were handled one direction =
at a time, and just ACKs coming back. Internally, they effectively provided =
an optimized UUCP tunnel atop their quite tenacious Packetized Ensemble =
Protocol (PEP).
