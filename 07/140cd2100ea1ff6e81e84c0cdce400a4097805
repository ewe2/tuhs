​Sounds good, although I might offer one slight twist.  I think
organizations should be the higher bit not systems, doc etc....   So you
have DEC, AT&T, UCB, MIT, USENIX, UI, OSF, *etc..*..  Under AT&T you will
have research and summit.​  Under UCB, you have CSRG, CAD, Ingress etc..
where you know things came from different teams.   Same for  MIT or the
like.  BTW: the anal fixation / some of the arguments we have had, I also
feel that Year of Distribution probably needs to be in the name if possible
(certainly in metadata or at least an explanatory README).  For things like
the USENIX tapes that's easier - because they were done by year.

Anyway - its only under these directories that then have the split of doc,
systems, *etc.*.

If there is cross linking, you certainly can do a little if that makes
sense.   But I think that It will be easier keep each collection from where
and when it came to help cement the origin & time and make it easier for
people to find things.
