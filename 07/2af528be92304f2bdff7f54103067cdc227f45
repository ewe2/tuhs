I've modified the code so compiles on FreeBSD but dlsym() still does not 
work: 

root at nudel ancientfs> ./ancientfs --type v7 --dmg v7_rl02_1145 /mnt/tmp
Undefined symbol "unixfs_v7"
invalid file system type v7
Exit 255 

dlsym() is kinda new to me so I'm a bit lost... 

I've uploaded a diff to the svn checkout which is mentioned on Amits page 
here: 

http://pofo.de/tmp/ancientfs_20081218_01.diff 

The changes are
 - casting to satisfy %llu and %lu printf
 - Makefile adjustments
 - enhance endian checks to support BYTE_ORDER
 - work around undefined OSSwap functions
