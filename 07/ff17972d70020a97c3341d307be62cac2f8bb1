yes, I think 0405 and 0407 a.out's are different.

I believe the V7 headers are 16 bytes and the text section starts at zero.
(heh, memory management)

The v1 headers are 12 bytes and the text section starts at 014 (i.e. the
header is part of the text section and *it* begins at zero, not the code)

So, if we assemble with the v7 as we need to adjust things a bit.
