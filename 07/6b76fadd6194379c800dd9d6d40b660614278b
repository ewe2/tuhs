What I remember reading is that once Dr. McIlroy conceived it, he wouldn't
let it go until one day Thompson announced that he was going to implement
it.

I'm curious whether he's familiar with the powershell spin on pipes and
what he thinks of it. Knowing he's something of a minimalist and a
curmudgeon, I suspect he doesn't fancy it much, but I personally think it's
a brilliant evolution of the concept. (With all due respect, of course. I
have nothing but admiration for the man.)
