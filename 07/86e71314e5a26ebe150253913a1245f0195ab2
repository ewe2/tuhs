Fair enough.  Mei culpa from one of those that was vocal.  That said, maybe
a trick is to stay away from texinfo/info and the man page discussion on
this list since its a hot button that causes much trama for some with a
more traditional UNIX view.

Please don't leave, your voice is important and I generally agree with you
and always like to hear you out.  But even if I do not agree, I still want
to listen.  You have come to your conclusions in a different manner than
some of us, and where each of us puts the MSB tends to color our views.
Diversity of opinion is a good thing.

Respectfully,
Clem
