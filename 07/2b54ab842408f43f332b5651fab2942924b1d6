Around the mid 80's,there was another case where the DoJ was willing to 
crush someone, not for causing a real disruption, but for getting into 
the wrong places and reading the wrong things.

I'll keep the details out, but the prosecution of RTM might have been 
more over the top because of preceding cases of hacking.
