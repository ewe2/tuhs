I recently saw indication that the UI for Sam and Acme were inspired by
Oberon.  (And per url [1] below, Rob Pike is quoted, sort of...)

I'd be interested (and I think that's a TUHS thing ;-) ) in hearing some
elaboration on that.  All that is said is that "Rob was blown away" and
that this "influenced" Sam/Acme; is there some further explanation of that
worth pointing at?  (Or are some Oberon fans putting words in mouths?  ;-) )

When confronted by a difficult problem, solve it by reducing it to the
question, "How would the Lone Ranger handle this?"
