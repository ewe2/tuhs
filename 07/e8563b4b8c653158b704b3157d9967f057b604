Are these systems bootable? I see all the source, but recall previous
discussions
about how bootstrapping them was tricky, or at least involved a large
number of
steps, each of which wasn't bad, but the whole path wasn't well mapped out.
For V[67] we at least have boot tapes from back in the day, and V5 has a
bootable
disk image...
