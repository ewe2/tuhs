Subject: [TUHS] NetBSD 0.8 kernel builds & runs!
Message-ID: <AANLkTik40yJ5CDLEoTFr1K6t7-z4HBM5tj3XQmRY_YB4@mail.gmail.com>

I had to use a good chunk of 386 BSD pl 23 to fill in the missing
parts from the CVS archive of the kernel, but I got it to build!

From the NetBSD 0.8 release/announcement it doe say:

The source for NetBSD is derived from 386BSD 0.1, patched
with the 0.2.2 patch kit.  In addition, many programs in
UCB's second BSD Networking Software Release which were
missing from 386BSD have been integrated into NetBSD, some
of the changes from the upcoming 0.2.3 patch kit have been
included, and many local additions and bug fixes have
been performed.

So I'm assuming this wouldn't be too far off then.

So for the curious, here is a dmesg:

I'm not sure if the 386BSD name is hanging around because of all the
386 BSD files I included of if it wasn't renamed in NetBSD 0.8 ...  I
can give anyone the list of files, steps etc, or it may be easier to
just download the merged & built sources here:

Thanks to everyone for providing the CVS and a few hints on what was
going on with it..!
