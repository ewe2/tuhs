I agree it's maddening!  This is what I have on my .bashrc file to avoid 
this behavior.

# Don't restore screen, quit at EOF, more-like prompt, pass color 
control chars
export LESS=-XEmR

This problem, and the desire to use the vi key bindings instead of the 
Emacs ones for command-line editing, are the reason I invested effort to 
place my login configuration under Git control, and replicate it on the 
tens of hosts I find myself logged in over a working day.  Now a simple 
"git clone" restores sanity to my working environment.
