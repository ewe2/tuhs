Warren has been nice enough to put 8th, 9th and 10th edition on the TUHS =
=E2=80=9CUnix Tree=E2=80=9D web page.

There is the following question on each entry web page: =E2=80=9CWho =
wants to write something here?=E2=80=9D

Below my suggested draft text for Eight Edition. All suggestions for =
improvement welcome.

=3D=3D=3D

Shortly after the release of 7th Edition, the VAX became the base =
machine for further Unix development. The initial code base was the 32V =
port, enhanced with selected elements from 4.1BSD, such as support for =
virtual memory and later the TCP/IP stack. =46rom there the code further =
evolved: Eighth Edition of Unix was released by Bell Laboratories in =
February 1985, six years after Seventh Edition.

Key innovations in 8th Edition include =E2=80=98streams=E2=80=99 and the =
'file system switch=E2=80=99, which allowed the =E2=80=9Ceverything is a =
file=E2=80=9D approach to be extended to new areas. Three notable =
applications built on these were the =E2=80=98/proc=E2=80=99 file system =
and new debugger API, a unified approach to networking over Datakit, =
TCP/IP and phone lines, and a network file system.

Eighth Edition is also at the root of graphical user interfaces on Unix, =
being the platform used for the development of the =E2=80=98Blit=E2=80=99 =
graphical terminal.

Several of the new ideas from Eigth Edition found their way into the 3rd =
release of System V, although in a much modified way.
