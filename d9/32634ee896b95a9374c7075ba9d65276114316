An early UNIX paper shows the system had four RK05's (4872 512-byte blocks
on UNIX, for some reason only 4800 used on the DEC OSs ... remember we had
to poke ROLLIN to copy the full UNIX partition standalone).
/dev/rk0 - available for user packs.
/dev/rk1 - root
/dev/rk2 - /usr
/dev/rk3 - /crp

I think it was just additional storage of "crap".
