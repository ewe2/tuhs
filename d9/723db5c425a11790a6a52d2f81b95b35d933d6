A friend of mine and I did the same, but with 68000. I wrote the 
assembler and other utilities, he did the hardware design (although we 
both took turns critiquing each other's work), and we both (and his 
girlfriend) did the wire-wrapping.

We were eventually consumed by other real-life happenings, and it fell 
by the wayside, but looking back at it now, UNIX would have been the 
perfect choice. I did have visions of grandeur that I would write my own 
OS for it - I'm sure I would have eventually learned my lesson ;)

PS: We cheated, and used static RAM. A few failed development projects 
at my (then) current place of employment, and no one knew what to do 
with "all these chips" that were left over. No problem, I know what to 
do with them... they wound up in the trunk of my Triumph TR7
