This seems like an unduly complicated theory.  Maxwell had a good
19th-century Scottish gentleman's education (he knew great chunks of
Paradise Lost by heart as a child) and he would have been far more familiar
with classical literature than most scientists are today as a result.
Chances are he knew what daemons were in mythology because he'd  read
either the Greek originals or Latin translations at school & university.


Given that, he could also have read about them in Plato's Republic when he
discusses the myth of Er at the end of the work.
