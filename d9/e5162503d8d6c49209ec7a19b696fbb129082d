Subject: [TUHS] OT - Has anyone seen / have a copy of computer lore story
 about a DC consolidation?
Message-ID: <a918ccfe-8228-3181-0aae-11f07e616fc6@spamtrap.tnetconsulting.net>

Sorry for the off topic post.

I'm hoping that someone here might have seen a (what I consider to be) a 
computer lore type story about a contractor that was brought in part way 
through a project to consolidate three DCs into one.  -  In the end he 
managed to do it early and under budget.  The kicker is that they quite 
literally physically moved and re-connected everything the way that it 
was.  Meaning that there were still WAN circuits (local only of course) 
between equipment that was previously in different DCs.

I would like to find a copy of this story and save it in my archive. But 
I've not been able to do so.  Thus I'm asking a wider audience to see if 
anyone might be able to give me a pointer.
