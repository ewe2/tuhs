Note that IBM punched cards had 72 data columns plus 8<br>

As to where the byte came from, it was christened for the IBM<br>
Stretch, aka 7020. The machine was bit-addressed and the width<br>
of a byte was variable. Multidimensional arrays of packed bytes<br>
could be streamed at blinding speeds. Eight bits, which synced<br>
