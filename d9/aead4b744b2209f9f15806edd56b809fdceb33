For Sun, it was quite the contrary.

It was normal to run binaries from SunOS on Solaris. For the longest 
time, the "xv" binary I used on SPARC hardware was compiled on SunOS. 
It's even an X-windows application, and the libraries work.

Even in Solaris 10, it still runs:

-bash-3.00$ ./xv.sparc
ld.so.1: xv.sparc: warning: /usr/4lib/libX11.so.4.3: has older revision 
than expected 10
ld.so.1: xv.sparc: warning: /usr/4lib/libc.so.1.9: has older revision 
than expected 160
-bash-3.00$ file xv.sparc
xv.sparc:       Sun demand paged SPARC executable dynamically linked
-bash-3.00$ uname -a
SunOS redacted 5.10 Generic_120011-11 sun4u sparc SUNW,SPARC-Enterprise


This has been deprecated as of Solaris 11, supposedly. Backwards 
compatibility for Solaris binaries is also a "thing".
