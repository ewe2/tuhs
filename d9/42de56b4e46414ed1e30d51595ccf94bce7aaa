Okay - let's make this an easy-to-dredge-through thread so I can easily
search for stuff later.

What means of interconnection are we going to use?

I should be able to provide:
1). Actual dial-in (probably not anything above 1200 baud...if I am
lucky)
2). SIMH "virtual leased line" dial-in
3). Network mail

A map/list of interconnections would be nice.  Need a central database
somewhere.
