For me it's not just a matter of defeating SCO, it's also one of sheer
indignation in the face of Saganesque FUD ("billions and billions of
lines of code"). I seriously want to know if there's even the tiniest
possibility that SCO is right, or if they're are just Smoking Crack Often.
 
While we're on the topic, I saw esr's code shredder/comparator that works
on lines of code. This isn't going to work if variables get renamed etc.
I'm writing a code comparator that works on a lexical basis, comparing
C tokens. It's only going to be proof of concept (i.e. slow), but I
should have it done by week's end and I'll pop a notice in here when it's
ready.
 
Cheers,
