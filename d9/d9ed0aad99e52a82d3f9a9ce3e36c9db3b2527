The 'gnu' version (or maybe just gnu licensed) of pico, cuz there has to
be a 'gnu' licensed of everything :-/

I used pine for years, now alpine, fingers are as hard wired for moving
around in it as they are for doing things in vi(m).  However, I also
have (al)pine use vi for the message editing. :)

I learned ed a long time ago because I once had some box that would boot
into single-user mode, but not far enough to get any termcap/info stuff
loaded, vi didn't work, ex didn't work, but ed did.  Not too long ago, I
used ed to fix a hosed up passwd file via salt... did something like:

sudo salt some-box cmd.run 'printf "1\n/mparson\ns/foo/bar/\nw\nq\n" | ed /etc/passwd'

I don't remember what exactly was wrong, but it prevented someone from
being able to log in and it wasn't fixable with the 'users' state.
Maybe it was a bad path to root's shell and we couldn't log in on the
console or something.  I've slept since then, lost the details.

The guy watching over my shoulder didn't even know what 'ed' was.
