curiouser and curiouser, at least some Go packages parse it that way:

rminnich@a300:~/go/src/github.com/u-root/u-root/cmds/core/ping$ cpu
-key ~/.ssh/cpu_rsa 192.168.16 date
Sat May  7 12:56:29 PM PDT 2022
rminnich@a300:~/go/src/github.com/u-root/u-root/cmds/core/ping$ cpu
-key ~/.ssh/cpu_rsa 192.168.0.16 date
Sat May  7 12:57:05 PM PDT 2022
rminnich@a300:~/go/src/github.com/u-root/u-root/cmds/core/ping$

[cpu is basically ssh with the plan 9 cpu command baked in, written in Go]

So as a convention, it's been out and about for close to 40 years,
many systems honor it, it seems not many people know of it, and not
everything interprets it the same way. Huh! Well, you learn something
new every day.

I found it a wonderful shorthand when somebody showed it to me, and
it's wired into my fingers at this point. I just assumed everyone else
used it too. I may dig around and try to figure out when Plan 9 picked
it up, that might give me some idea as to provenance.
