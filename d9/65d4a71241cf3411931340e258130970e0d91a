Mojibake, though not unknown, is now much less common, and the number
of documents on the web that are in UTF-8 (including its ASCII subset)
is at 85% and rising.

That particular piece of code still works if the encoding is UTF-8.
Fundamentally, Unicode is complicated because human writing systems
are complicated.

Well, if the font isn't fixed-width, you're screwed anyway.  But if
it is, there is information in the Unicode tables that tells you which
characters have widths of 0, 1, or 2.  Print programs can be modified
to use that information.

Colors are optional.

Other than Greek and Cyrillic A letters, there are the math letters, which
are used *in plain text* to designate semantic differences: plain A,
italic A, and bold A mean different things mathematically.  Using the
math italics for emphasis or book titles is a Bad Thing.
