I agree with this, with one caveat: there are things which exist in /proc which should be in a standard format (extensible if need be) but are not.  I forget the particular example but I've written patches for, I think, node.js which essentially came down to "add yet another special case for /proc/<whatever>", when there was just no reason that the thing should not have been in a standard format in the first place.

Certainly as a user of Solaris and Linux, Linux's /proc is just far more useful (though I like pmap).
