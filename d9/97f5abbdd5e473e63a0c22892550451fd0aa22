I think back to those mouldy oldie days, and my set of early things were...
- First got exposed to BSD 4.1 with MFCF extensions ('86)
- Couldn't afford *real* hardware, so I tracked whatever could run on
   Atari ST, and the biggest improvement I was able to get there was
   to be able to run Bash, early GCC, and sundry GNU tools, where
   I couldn't spawn multiple processes, but there was still plenty of useful
- Then followed the MiNT period (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiNT)
   where we accepted that MiNT is NOT TOS, but still lended a POSIX
   interface, only to be briefly overjoyed at the rename to "MiNT is
   NOW TOS"
- First paid work on Unix ('93) involved SCO (where that was the
  debugging platform for some C code targeting VMS!); that was a
  platform where I was pretty overjoyed to discover I could run multiple
  terms on a single console.  And found it odd when people thought this
  was a huge innovation of Linux...

I'm not sure I have much that's extraordinarily interesting to say about
MiNT, but I'd think that to be pretty on-topic for TUHS :-).
