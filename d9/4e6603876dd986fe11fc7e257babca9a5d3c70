I remember back in the original SCO vs the world days when SGi apparently dumped some 32v and was quickly dumped from Linux, there was some source auditing tool that they used?  All I remember is that it used the term 'shards' which of course is popular with the DB kids so it's hard to find...  Now that there is an insane dump it'd be interesting to compare actual ancestry vs what we've always been told...
