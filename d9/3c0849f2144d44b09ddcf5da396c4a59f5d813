Subject: [pups] extract old archive format?
Message-ID: <alpine.NEB.2.01.1004080812010.13963@t1.m.reedmedia.net>

I want to look in some .a files identified by file(1) as "old PDP-11 
archive".

Anyone know what tool I can use on a modern *BSD or Linux system to 
extract the files from an "old PDP-11" ar archive?

GNU ar complains "File format not recognized". ar tells me:

 ar: supported targets: elf64-x86-64 elf32-i386 a.out-i386-netbsd 
 coff-i386 efi-app-ia32 elf64-little elf64-big elf32-little elf32-big 
 srec symbolsrec tekhex binary ihex netbsd-core

But I have no idea how to try different targets. The GNU ar manual page 
doesn't tell me much.

Or how can I use modern pcc or gcc to compile old pre-ansi ar.c?

Any suggestions?

Now I found a simtools.zip via http://simh.trailing-edge.com/ which is 
"a collection of tools for manipulating simulator file formats and for 
cross-assembling code for the PDP-1, PDP-7, PDP-8, and PDP-11." But I am 
not sure if this is related. On that note, any ideas how to extract 
files from a ".tap" file used by simh? (For now I use view or strings to 
look at it.)

Thanks,
