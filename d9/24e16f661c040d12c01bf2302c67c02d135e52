Subject: [TUHS] Happy birthday, Morris Worm!
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.21.1711020915520.66513@aneurin.horsfall.org>

The infamous Morris Worm was released in 1988; making use of known 
vulnerabilities in Sendmail/finger/RSH (and weak passwords), it took out a 
metric shitload of SUN-3s and 4BSD Vaxen (the author claimed that it was 
accidental, but the idiot hadn't tested it on an isolated network first). 
A temporary "condom" was discovered by Rich Kulawiec with "mkdir /tmp/sh".
