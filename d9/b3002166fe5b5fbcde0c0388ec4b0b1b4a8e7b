It seems the story is more complicated. In a 1993 retrospective Fraser =
writes:

"The first Datakit protocols used a packet structure that was aligned =
with cell boundaries. Chesson designed a file transfer protocol that =
transported data in variable length packets, each ending with a trailer. =
There was no packet header. It was argued that it is easy to generate a =
trailer after the body of a packet has been transmitted, and that =
control information in a trailer arrives at the receiver just when the =
receiver is ready to process that information.=E2=80=9D

Fraser uses the plural =E2=80=9Cthe first protocols=E2=80=9D: it would =
seem that there is not a single reference point. It also mentions that =
the protocols used a trailer, which does not match with the PK protocol. =
On the other hand this is a reference to a =E2=80=9Cfile transfer =
protocol=E2=80=9D which is not the same as a =E2=80=9Clink protocol=E2=80=9D=
.

Also, Chesson wrote a note on the PK driver a few years after the V7 =
release (e.g. here: =
https://pd.spuddy.org/fs/simtel20/uucp/uucproto.des). In this note he =
writes:

"The resemblance between the flow control procedure in the packet driver =
and that defined for X.25 is no accident. The packet driver protocol =
began life as an attempt at cleaning up X.25.  That is why, for example, =
control information is uniform in length (one byte), there is no RNR =
message (not needed), and there is but one timeout defined in the =
sender.=E2=80=9D

Earlier in the note Chesson also emphasised that the PK protocol was =
used for variation and experimentation. In the X.25 context, the =
reference to a CRC-based driver in the PK source may refer to a =
HDLC-like physical link.

All in all it would seem that the PK driver is *not* what was used as an =
early Datakit protocol. However, it is probably the best proxy for what =
such a driver looked like that we  have. It would seem likely to me that =
for instance the buffer strategy used in the PK driver would be about =
the same as that used for the Datakit driver(s) in V7.

It is possible that a variation of the PK protocol was used for Datakit =
around V7 time.
