Subject: [TUHS] OT: Need help from a *BSD guru
Message-ID: <201801220810.w0M8ABbq002485@freefriends.org>

Hi.

Can a modern BSD guru please contact me off-list?  I have a set of related
tests in the gawk test suite that consistently fail on just about every
*BSD system.  It has me stumped, and I'd like to see these tests working
if possible.

(They've been not working for quite a while. That I get no complaints
from BSD users tells me that gawk isn't popular in that world, but that's
another story. :-)

Thanks,

Arnold
