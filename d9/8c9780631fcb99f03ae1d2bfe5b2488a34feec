FYI, I watched the video you referred to (my daughter having woken up) and
Simon's comments seem to be in direct contradiction of your earlier
statement. The relevant comments start at around 35:30, and he says that
the Sun engineering community pretty clearly favored a BSD-style license.
He mentions that trying to use the GPL would have pushed out their timeline
by several years. The ``you do that and we quit'' comment (around the 38
minute park) was quite clearly in response to using GPL for OpenSolaris.
