I've read stuff that old that was stored in worse conditions.  9-track
is surprisingly robust.  Humidity can be worse on the 80s-era media,
aggravating the "sticky shed" problem.  There are several methods for
dealing with that, including low temp baking, chemical treatments,
stripping coating off the back side of the tape, etc.  I use a low-tech
baking solution at home.  Most methods give you a limited number of
reads over a fairly short time period.
