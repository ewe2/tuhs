Ah, the mighty 11/60; boy, but that takes me back.  We bought one to 
replace our ageing /40, and I was fascinated by its octal display (yes, I 
wrote an idle loop to shift its digits back and forth; there should be an 
article somewhere in the AUUG archives).

Story time: DEC were flogging the /60s real cheap here in Oz, because a 
deal with a major publisher (Murdoch?  Packer?  Who knows?) fell through 
at the last moment, and they had an entire warehouse to shift.

Trivia: the thing was micro-codeable, and I had dreams of implementing the 
Unix call/return sequences as single instructions, but I never did get a 
round tuit.
