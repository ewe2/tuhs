Hi -

	Which part of the advice?   ;)

	The part of the advice that might be most useful was to put a 
	copy of the standalone disklabel program in / and boot it - NOT
	run the usermode version while the system is running.

	cd /sys/pdpstand
	make
	cp disklabel /

	then reboot the system and at the ':' prompt enter ra(0,0)disklabel

	there are things that can be done with the standalone version that
	are either impractical under a kernel (because the 'a'/root partition
	is open/busy) or because the standalone version has no safety checks.

	'fstype' is what I had in mind.  

  a:    16720        0   2.11BSD     1024  1024         # (Cyl.    0 - 39)

	Now I am confused.   2.11BSD is correct - but then it's "unknown" and
	that would cause the 'iinit' panic that started this thread of
	discussion.

	Down the path of logic that results in a 'iinit' panic and the 
	'no fs' there's a check for the filesystem type and "unknown" was the
	likely cause (or at least that was the hope).

	If the standalone disklabel program says it's "2.11BSD" then there's
	something else going on - the next likely thought is that 'rootdev'
	or related entity isn't set to the device that is the actual root
	filesystem.

> Just for grins, I tried modifying the drive type, too - no success there,

	That's not used for anything important.

	~12 is a good number - not much need for more than that as a rule.
