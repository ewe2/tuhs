Subject: [pups] Bringing up the fist C compiler
Message-ID: <15735.4259.641449.366341@tfeb.org>

Is there a description anywhere of how C was originally bootstrapped?
I'm sure it was nothing unconventional, but the question of how you
bring up compilers for other languages which are implemented in their
own language seems to mystify some people to the extent that they
argue that the compiler must be written in C (which is `always
there'), and I thought it would be good to have the real story about C
to tell them.

Thanks
