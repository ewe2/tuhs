Taken from http://www.darwinsys.com/history/hist.html:

The early evolution of the C language has been described elsewhere ...
It is May, 1975, and the new improved Sixth Edition is about to be released...
There follows a succession of releases of the C compiler. The PWB
1.0 release of UNIX, the first outside the labs of a non-Research
from Bell, goes out in 1977. And a special release tape known only as
``Phototypesetter Version 7'' includes a new release of troff as well
as the C compiler, assembler, loader, archiver and bits of the C library.

Cheers, Warren
