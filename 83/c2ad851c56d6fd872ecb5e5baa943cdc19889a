	And you use "size" on the .o files to see how much each object file
	contributes to an overlay.

	With the exception of a few .o files which *must* be in the base
	segment (and these are identified in the Makefile) anything can go
	anywhere it will fit.  The overlay switching is extremely efficient
	so don't worry about the 'affinity' of modules too much.

	Oh, it should be mentioned that it is not legal to have an empty 
	(0 length) overlay except at the end - i.e. you can't have overlay 3
	be 0 bytes if overlay 4 or higher has nonzero size.

	With the exception of perhaps the tty driver for the specific serial
	devices present on the system it's not worth trying to pack things
	"optimally".   The overhead of overlays is inhererent in the function
	prologue and epilogue - the only extra overhead of actually switching
	overlays is stuffing ~two words or so into the MMU registers.

	DO NOT remove anything from the actual OV lines in the makefile - just
	make sure you define/configure devices as not being present in the
	config file (by saying you have 0 of them).  Then the .o files do
	not take up any space and can be segregated into unused overlays
	at the end (OV9 or 10 or so).

	Good Luck!
