Subject: [TUHS] Running RENO on windows via SIMH...
Message-ID: <46b366130710101548m15aac27bycd615e4c41d2f78b@mail.gmail.com>

I don't know if anyone would be interested in this...


http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=204974&package_id=245145

I've hacked up a copy of simh to include slirp (usermode networking from
qemu), and packed up a copy of 4.3RENO.

It should be pretty easy for Windows users to just install & hit the "run
4.3BSD-RENO" icon...

The download is just under 90 megabytes, and I've included nearly 80 pdf's..
Unfortunatly not all of the converted cleanly..

At any rate I'm sure the base install needs more tweaking, and I should load
more software onto the /usr/local drive (which I've made a seperate disk to
allow for easy updating..)

As always feel free to download & give it a test.  At the least it should be
a painfee install & run.

Jason
