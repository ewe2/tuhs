Hello All

In case this is of interest:

> Date: Sat, 16 May 2020 12:18:15 +0100
> Subject: qed-archive (Github)
> To: arnold@skeeve.com
>
> Hi Arnold
>
> Apologies for an un-solicited email.
>
> I have ported Rob's UofT QED from your qed-archive/unix-1992 to Linux
> (although I suspect anything with a Unix API will work), and have updated
> it to work completely in UTF8/Unicode. This includes correct handling of
> unicode codepoints in regexes, subs, etc.
>
> It's up on Github under phonologus/QED. I thought you might want to add it
> to your list of QED-s in your README, as it may be of interest to the other
> three connoisseurs out there...!
>
> I have also included typeset pdf-s of the tutorial and manpage. The
> tutorial is fascinating.
>
> Also, there is no clear statement about copyright, or license, of the
> unix-1992 tarball. I have attributed it to Rob, and I have noted that I
> scavenged it from your Github repo, but was wondering if there is any
> definitive statement on ownership/authorship that I could include in my
> repo?
>
> Best wishes
