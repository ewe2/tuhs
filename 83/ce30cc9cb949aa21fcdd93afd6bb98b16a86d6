Apologies, typical of my terse replies - I was actually concerned
with clearing up the possible misconception that "=+" was a "feature"
of V7 rather than an "obsolete" holdover from V6.  I suppose historic
accuracy in this context is of little use, I don't know.  I certainly
can believe one can find such artifacts in the existing V7 code 8-)
