I’m pretty sure the V6 kernel didn’t run in split I/D.   It supported three user a.out formats:   407 (mixed I&D in one instructions space),
410 (mixed I&D but with the instructions in write protected segments), and 411 (split I&D).

It wasn’t too involved of a change to make a split I/D kernel.    Mike Muuss and his crew at JHU did it.   We spent more time getting the bootstrap to work than anything else I recall.
