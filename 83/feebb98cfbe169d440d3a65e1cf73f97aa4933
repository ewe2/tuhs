I too grew up on DecWriters writing MACRO-10 on TOPS-10 in high school. 
My favorite was the LA120 that I could change the character pitch and 
get 132 columns on 8.5" paper when we ran out of the wide stuff.

To this day, 80 columns just doesn't do it for me. I generally comment - 
a LOT - and in C the comments will stretch out past 80 columns easily.

VT100's had a 132 column mode. I wrote a terminal emulator for the 
IBM-XT circa 1985 to do 132 columns in it's highest-resolution. I 
couldn't take 80 columns, even back then ;)
