It shouldn't be too hard, but I'm not an assembly person, so it's best
that someone else tries. My previous e-mail about the 0405 and 0407 headers,
plus the fact that the 0405 header IS loaded in memory, should be enough.

No, but I can create an rk0.dsk image with my mkfs; then in simh I can
do check (no args) which checks both RF and RK filesystems; ditto df.
So it must be close.

As an alternative, it should not be too hard to hand-craft an 0405
a.out which simply mounts /dev/rk0 on /usr.

Cheers,

P.S s2 frags: yes, some of them are not fragments, but complete files,
even with junk leftover at the bottom of each file.
