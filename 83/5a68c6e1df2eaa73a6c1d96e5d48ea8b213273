It can't be done.

As others point out, the program is many times (100x or more?) too  
big -- likely even gcc 1.x is far too big, but gcc {2,3,4}.x are all  
meant for large 32-bit systems.

However, cross-compilation can certainly be easily done. I have made  
a PDP-11 back-end for lcc[1] (not quite complete but shows that it  
can be done), which is an ANSI (c89) compiler[2]. lcc is a much  
smaller and simpler compiler than gcc, but its executables are still  
massively outsize for PDP-11 systems.
