Yep, and I'm glad that I had bosses to whom I didn't have to explain why 
my comments were so voluminous.

And who first said "Write your code as though the next person to maintain 
it is a psychotic axe-wielding murderer who knows where you live"?  I've 
often thought that way (as the murderer I mean, not the murderee).

I'd name names, but he might be on this list...
