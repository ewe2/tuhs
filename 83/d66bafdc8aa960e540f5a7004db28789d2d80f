Correct.  The Oxford English Dictionary has two overlapping
definitions (along with dozens of others).  In each case I've shown
the earliest attestation:

 5. Originally U.S.

  a. A defect or fault in a machine (esp. an electrical or electronic
     one), or in a process, etc.

     1875 Operator 15 Aug. 5/1 The biggest =E2=80=98bug=E2=80=99 yet has be=
en
          discovered in the U.S. Hotel Electric Annunciator.

  b. Computing. An error or other cause of malfunction in a computer
     program, piece of software, etc.

     1952 Rev. Electronic Digital Computers
          (Amer. Inst. Electr. Engineers) 18/2 The week we spent in
          getting the last bug out of our instruction program was an
          investment we hated to have to make.

It's interesting that they differentiate between the two.
