I love my Boox Nova Air.  I carry with me just about everywhere.  I can
read the book I'm currently reading, plus I also scribble notes and
doodles in the note app.  I've doodled ideas for things I later work up
in FreeCAD for 3D printing.  If my focus was more on the note taking and
drawing, I'd have gone for the bigger, closer to sheet-of-paper sized
devices, but I primarily wanted an e-ink e-reader that could also do
other things.  So far, I've been very impressed with the other things it
could do.

I've been a fan of e-ink displays for a long time.  I really wish
someone would make a reasonbly priced 20+ inch e-ink monitor.  Most of
the stuff I deal with is in text, and working with text on an e-ink
display would be so much easier on the eyes.

I only mentioned the reMarkable because it seems to be one of the
popular ones out there, or maybe they just have better marketing.  I
think my wife said that one of the women she works with at her design
firm has a reMarkable and loves it.

I miss fan-fold paper too... I pretty much quit printing out program
listings when I quit having tractor-fed printers.  It just wasn't the
same.  Also, no more multi-page big-text banners. :)
