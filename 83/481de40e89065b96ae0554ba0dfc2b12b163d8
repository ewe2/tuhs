I=E2=80=99ve just spent a fun hour looking at the old Whirlwind =
documents.  I think I agree with Angelo.

The 1947 block diagrams and time-pulse charts show that the original =
=E2=80=9CSP=E2=80=9D (subprogram) instruction transferred the low 11 =
bits of the instruction directly to the program counter.  They do not =
show the old program counter being saved in the AR register, nor is =
there yet the =E2=80=9CTA=E2=80=9D (transfer address) instruction to =
save the AR register to memory.

Evidently both these new features, which together provide a branch and =
link function were likely described in memo M-647, which is not scanned =
anywhere I can find.  It is called =E2=80=9CSome new orders for WWI"

There was already logic for the program counter to drive the bus, and =
logic to capture the bus into the AR register, so the modification to SP =
to save the old program counter was likely pretty easy: drive the bus =
from the program counter, and capture it in AR, just by adding some new =
diodes to the sequencer.

Adding the Transfer Address instruction was likely also pretty easy, =
since there was a way for the AR register to drive the bus.=20

With the new SP and TA, one would use SP to call a subroutine, and the =
first instruction of any subroutine would be TA to save the return =
address into the final location of the subroutine.  (TA only modified =
the low 11 bits of the 16 bit location)

Before these instructions, a subroutine call would require one =
additional memory location, to hold the return address for each point of =
call, and one additional instruction, one to load the return address =
into the accumulator and one to store it into the code at the end of the =
subroutine. (The latter could be the first instruction of the =
subroutine.)

Originally I thought that maybe David Wheeler invented the Link =
register, since he=E2=80=99s often credited with inventing the =
subroutine, but it looks like the particular thing he did was the idea =
of the =E2=80=9CWheeler Jump=E2=80=9D where code explicitly stores the =
return address into the instruction at the end of the subroutine.  That =
idea was used in Whirlwind as well.  EDSAC I did not have link, but it =
was proposed for EDSAC II.  Whirlwind was likely first to implement.
