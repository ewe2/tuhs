Weirdness - my original reply to your mail never showed up....

First of all, YES to v6!  That's what I have on my 11/34, with 192k of
MOS memory and two RK05 drives.  You can regen the whole system with no
problem.  I'm only running the console on it, but in multiuser mode.  

One of the images on the PUPS site is a v6 distribution tape.  But even
if you don't have a tape drive, it seems you could build a disk image on
an emulator, then stream that over to your RL with vtserver.  I've had
some success doing this with other machines (fortunately, the archives
contained RK05 images and I have RKs).  -- Ian

but, can we install a RK05 image into an RL02 drive ? :%

or, maybe a V6 ?
