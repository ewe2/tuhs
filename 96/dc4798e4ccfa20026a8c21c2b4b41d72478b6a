When Bill Joy added the "multi-group stuff" to BSD all directories became
implicitly set-gid:

https://svnweb.freebsd.org/csrg/sys/ufs/ffs/ffs_inode.c?r1=4818&r2=5855

This is in SCCS revision 4.8 so I think it appeared in 4.2BSD

As I understand it, when group support was improved in System V they did
not change creat() to match BSD but instead used the directory set-gid bit
to provide opt-in BSD semantics. I don't know if this was in Solaris or
earlier?

BSD again :-) SCCS revision 6.6 so I think it appeared in 4.3BSD

Mull of Galloway to Mull of Kintyre including the Firth of Clyde and North
Channel: Variable 1 to 3, becoming easterly or southeasterly 2 to 4 later.
Smooth, occasionally slight at first in North Channel. Showers for a time near
shore. Good.
