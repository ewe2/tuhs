There was a bit of a stir about 10 years ago when CMU switched from Java (I
think?) to Python and SML for introductory computer science education. I
remember reading a report at the time, which I _think_ is this:
http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/2010/CMU-CS-10-140.pdf

Though perhaps not, because it _really_ bit into Java and the whole OOP
thing.

Robert Harper had a blog post that I found interesting about exposing
freshmen to functional programming:
