Years ago at BRL, we had a division chief that typed with only two fingers.     One of my coworkers modded the "stty" command to include "two-finger" in the list of modes when that user ran it.
Of course, it was slightly laughable when he discovered it and found there was no way to disable it.

The "make love" harkens back to TECO which would print "NOT WAR?" 

Years ago, Milo Medin found that there was a "backdoor" password into the Proteon routers that he discovered running "strings" on the binary.    After making a stink about it, Proteon removed (or just changed) the password.    However, if you ran strings on the binary, about the same place you'd have found the original backdoor password was a string "Not so easy this time, eh Milo?"
