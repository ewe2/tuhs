1982, the dual-processor MC500/DP originally with 68000s upgraded to 010's
shortly after they became available[see below]
1984, the 16 Processor MC5000/700 using '020 [the 500 was renamed the
MC5000/500 and a single processor MC5000/300 was also introduced.  In the
/700 and /300 design the fixor was unneeded and the base 020 serviced it's
own faults].

FWIW: Purdue VAX predates the 500/DP, but was a one-off that George made.
 The Sequent MP box would be about 3 or 4 years later.

Through the RTU 2.x, the OS originally ran Purdue VAX-like [*Goble/Marsh: I=
SCA
'82: Proceedings of the 9th annual symposium on Computer Architecture: "A
Dual Processor VAX 11/780", **Pages 291=E2=80=93298*] in all interrupts and=
 system
calls went to a 'master'  and the second MPU/CPU board ran as a 'slave' (
*i.e.* user-mode code). By RTU 3.0 ~12 mons later, full locks were done and
each processor could service anything.


Note each CPU/MPU board had processor two chips on it, the executor and
fixor but the board was really not a multiprocessor - the second chip was
literally just running kernel code to service the page fault.  Thus (not
including the other 68000's processors in graphics or I/O boards) the
500/DP had either 4 68000's or 2 68010 & 2 68000's in it when it had two
CPU or two MPU boards in the backplane.  The idea was originally proposed
for the Z8000 by Forest Baskett at an early Asilomar conference.   The
formal citation is: Forest Baskett: "*Pascal and Virtual Memory in a Z8000
or MC68000 based Design Station*," COMPCON 80, Digest of Papers, pp
456-459, IEEE Computer Society, Feb. 25, 1980.
