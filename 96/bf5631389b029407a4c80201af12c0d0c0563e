Subject: [TUHS] The QED editor, and its modern versions
Message-ID: <87k26o0xng.fsf@gmail.com>


While we are on the topic of old Unix editors,
I once made Caltech qed build again:
https://github.com/chneukirchen/qed-caltech

Also, I've been trying to contact David Tilbrook, who maintains(-ed?)
his own version of qed, without success.  I got an evaluation copy of
his QEF build system, which contains a bit of documentation about it,
but no binary.

Perhaps someone here can help out, or knows more?
