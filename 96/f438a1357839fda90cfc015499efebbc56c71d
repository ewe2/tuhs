I came across a website that discusses reviving an old binary for Lotus =
1-2-3 for SysV Unix (386 COFF), on the way to making it run on Linux:

https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/linux123.html

The audience here may enjoy the read, and maybe it is of use when =
reviving other old application software for 1980=E2=80=99s and 1990=E2=80=99=
s Unix.

The key part I think is this:

Quote:

"Yikes - it=E2=80=99s an original unstripped object file from 1-2-3. =
There are nearly 20,000 symbols including private symbols and debug =
information.

Why would Lotus ship this? It=E2=80=99s so big it must have required =
them to phyiscally ship an extra disk to every customer? Could it have =
been a mistake, accidentally left on the final release image?

I had so many questions, but I=E2=80=99m not old enough to have any =
experience with SysV, so I asked the greybeards on =
alt.folklore.computers if they had seen this before and why this might =
have happened.

The answer was that this is probably deliberate - dlopen() was not =
widely available on UNIX in the early 90s, so there was no easy way to =
load native plugins or extensions. To solve this, vendors would ship a =
bunch of partially linked object files with a script to relink them with =
your extensions =E2=80=93 Clever!"=
