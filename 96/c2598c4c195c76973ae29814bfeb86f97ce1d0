There was a natural bias towards SysV interfaces, which highlighted the
differences with BSD interfaces in some areas and may have left that
impression...

Linus certainly had access to SysV or SysV derived systems, but there
wasn't even a whisper at the time he copied code from there. And the few
maybe less than completely legit versions of SysV that are now available
bear this out: they look nothing at all like the 0.11-linux tree.

Thank goodness for the sockets thing... Even though it's a horrible
interface, it was less horrible than STREAMS...
