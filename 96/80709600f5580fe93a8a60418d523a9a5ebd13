Joerg Schilling:

  This is done on a UNIX implementation that uses STREAMS.

  SVr4 is such a UNIX.

======

I know that SVr4 has STREAMS (somewhat more elaborate than
the original stream I/O system, but the same principles),
and knew (though I'd forgotten) that Ethernet devices are
stream-capable.  I did an implementation of the late
lamented Coraid's AoE protocol that took advantage of that.
Somewhat like the Research IP implementation, in fact:
there was an AoE line discipline to be pushed onto an
Ethernet device, coupled to devices in /dev/dsk and /dev/rdsk.

But is IP done that way in SVr4 (or at least in Solaris, its
most-visible descendant)?  I had the impression that the
IP stack was more like the BSD one, with everything coupled
together within the kernel and a fundamentally socket interface.

I've never actually looked at the code, though.
