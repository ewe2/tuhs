Well, if the nose of a camel comes in under the tent, the rest of the camel
is sure to follow... Parsing a string path is rock simple, but are there
two arguments or three for this command, and what happens if they are too
long, or negative when you expect and fd, or or or. The CVE-archive is
littered with people who thought parsing in the kernel was simple and
easy...

That's the other reason to not do stings in the kernel: parsing is takes
time.

I'll grant there's a balance here: A single int fd is nice so you don't
have to pass a pointer to the device call function and provides a level of
abstraction that blocks many bad data attacks. But even with this interface
there's been issues with improper range checks for some interfaces.
