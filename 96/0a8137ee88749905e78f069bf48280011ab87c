This all dates from the mid-1980s. It's reproduced in Knuth's
book "Literate Progrmming", which you can find on Amazon and is
well worth owning. That book has some other gems, including his
famous paper "Structure Programming With goto Statements".

The original Programming Pearls column was published in CACM.
Google helps find it:

I have that book.

There's also the LCC C compiler book which was done in a literate style.
