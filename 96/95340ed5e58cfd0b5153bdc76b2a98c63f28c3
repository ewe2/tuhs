 From memory (fairly old memory) if you had a Sun then you had a  
license to run SunOS.  This possibly applies only to smaller machines  
- certainly later on (in the Solaris era) you had to buy extra  
licenses for machines with more than a few (1? 2?) processors.   
Obviously that's not true any more.

Of course you should check the license.
