Aren't to supposed to make an "egg", or something?

Even before those, you could make a package, "sdist" it, and have the
recipients run "python setup.py install".  Still simpler process than
installing many C libraries from source ...

I was once in a remote job interview with a Ruby shop.  I don't know
Ruby, but they said I could use Python.  Of course this situation came
up (it's pretty common when you think about it) and on this occasion a
whim made me write it thus:

while True:
    val = function()
    if val == STOP:
        break
    do_something()

Their reply was overflowing with shock and horror that I would use
"while True", and that was the end of that opportunity for me.
Apparently Ruby has a construct to handle this cleanly, without having
to call function() from two sites.

What's a Torontonian doing in Texas?  Are you researching the sequel to
"Tideland" ? :-)
