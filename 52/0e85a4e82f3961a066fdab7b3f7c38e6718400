Subject: [TUHS] Old newsletters
Message-ID: <20151231211432.GA27092@minnie.tuhs.org>

I was going through the old AUUG newsletters at
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Documentation/AUUGN/
looking for wiki material. They are a mine of information!

I've sent an e-mail off to the UKUUG folk to see if they have any
on-line newsletters. Does anybody know what happened to EUUG, especialy
if any of their newsletters have been digitised?

And Usenix ;login, are any of their old newsletters available?
If not, who can I lobby to get this done? There's only 3 1/2 years
left before the 50th anniversary!

Cheers, Warren
