	And that's the cause of the problem.  The kernel is scanning for
	'\n' and when it finds the (unix) end-of-line character it then
	tries to exec the program "/bin/sh\r" and fails.

	Was the original script created on a windoze box perhaps?  Or was
	a different method of getting a \r  used? :)

	Cheers,
