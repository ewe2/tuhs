The 33 and 28 needed at least two null chars after the <CR> or it would
lose chars as there was no buffering.  The Unix driver has the CR delay
modes to support it.  It=E2=80=99s UART as it were was mechanical and a rea=
l work
of art.   I remember spending a few hours trying to figure out how it
worked.

As for the LA120 yeah you really needed to use real flow control which
could be a problem on DL11s and DZs ports.   SW flow was less than
prefect.  However, the Able version of the DH supported flow in hardware
(RTS/CTS style) so you could set them to interface with the host at 960cps
and then print as fast as possible swiping back and forth on the paper as
the local microprocessor in the decwritter buffered everything.
