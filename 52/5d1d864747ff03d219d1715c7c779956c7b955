"Use the source, Luke!" This is particularly true on V6, where it's assumed
that recourse to the source (which is always at hand - long before RMS and
'Free Software', mind) will be an early step.

On vanilla V6? Hmm. On a system with 'more' (hint, hint ;-), I'd just do 'od
{file} | more', and stop it after the first page. Without 'more', I'd probably
send the 'od' output to a file, and use 'ed' to look at the first couple of
lines.

Back in the day, of course, on a (slow) printing terminal, one could have just
said 'od', and aborted it after the first couple of lines. These days, with
video terminals, 'more' is kind of really necessary. Grab the one off my V6
Unix site, it's V6-ready (should be a compile-and-go).
