Hey, I never made any claim as to its veracity, and I lost my old manuals 
in a house move.

On the *nix systems to which I have access, bc(1) is a standalone
program on FreeBSD and OSX, but pipes to dc(1) on OpenBSD.  I cannot
check my Penguin box (Ubuntu) because its keyboard died, and I didn't
set up remote access to it.

All boxen say "arbitrary-precision arithmetic language and calculator" or 
variants thereof.
