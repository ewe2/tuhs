Subject: [Unix-jun72] Missing commands
Message-ID: <20080503084817.GA51986@minnie.tuhs.org>

I thought I would quickly make a list of commands we have, commands that
are missing, and out-of-the-ordinary commands. Below, if a command has
no comment, it's a V1 command that we have. Notes follow. I have not tried
to list the missing /etc and /usr/... commands yet.

I have a quote from dmr somewhere (I can't find it), but to paraphrase:
early UNIX was under a constant state of development. We would tidy up
now and then, write a new manual, then get back to development.

The 1st Edition UNIX manual is dated November 3, 1971.
The 2nd Edition UNIX manual is dated June 12, 1972.

1st Edition (1e) only used 0405 a.out files. 2nd Edition (2e) only used
0407 a.out files. I would guess that the executables that we have from
the s2 tape are from a snapshot halfway between 1e and 2e, and at that
point in time the kernel could execute both varieties. This would explain
why some V2 commands are 0405 style, and some are 0407 style.

Despite the dates on the PDF commentary where we got the kernel source,
the kernel has to be around 1e, not much later. The kernel only knows
about 0405 a.out files, and is missing all of the system calls new to 2e:
hog, kill, makdir (renamed from 1e mkdir), smdate and sync.

So: kernel is around 1e, Nov 1971 or close; executables are somewhere
between 1e and 2e, but before June 1972 as we have 0405 and 0407 ones.

Cheers,
	Warren
