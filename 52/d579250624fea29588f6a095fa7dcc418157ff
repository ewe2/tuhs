I wasn't being snarky.  You said

  "The output is seen as truth because the representation is for some
  reason too hard to get at or too hard to cascade through the system."

I honestly have no idea what that means.

Likewise, 

  "There's a total comedy of work going on in the unix way of
  a wc pipeline versus calling a length function on a list."

I just don't know what you mean.

Jon
