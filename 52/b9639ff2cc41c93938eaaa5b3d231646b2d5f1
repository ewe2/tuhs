Your correspondents have done a good job of reconstructing the
old list. Alas, I can't remember the only missing entry, Dick
Haight's login. The above list, however, wants one small
correction. Robert Morris did not have a middle name, the
"h" was a figment for filling in forms that wanted a middle
initial.
Another important name is
L. L. Cherry llc
