As I said I=E2=80=99m not sure but I thought I remember them being there.  I=
 no longer have that distribution tape so I cannot diff it. =20

If i recall the order the three Ritchie compilers we had that supported stdi=
o were typesetter, Unix/TS and then finally 7th Edition.  I remember they we=
 all slightly different but don=E2=80=99t remember what they the differences=
 were. =20

As Steve has previously said Dennis was constantly improving the compiler, s=
o I suspect it was just the state of the world when those snapshots were tak=
en. =20

The big changes to the language were between 6th Edition and Typesetter whic=
h were done in concert if not to support Brian=E2=80=99s work on the troff r=
ewrite.  Plus the first draft of book was being written around then also.=20=


The book definitely predates 7th edition=E2=80=99s release which I date beca=
use we did not get Seventh Edition until spring 79 and Ted had xeroxgraphic c=
opies of the book at least a year earlier, which was when we were running TS=
 which he had brought from the Labs. =20
