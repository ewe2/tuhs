Argh.  I already replied to this privately before noticing it had
been sent to the list.  I sent Peter a longer reply, but the quick
version is that http://www.openwatcom.org/download_lic.html will
get you to the source code.

Although their compiler will generate 8086 code, it seems reasonably
unlikely that the compiler itself can be made to fit on an 8086.
