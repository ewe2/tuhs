I worked with a successor device the Tektronix 4010. It's a storage  
scope that doubles as a terminal. It ought to be easy enough to  
emulate the alphanumeric part of this with a terminal but the  
graphical capabilities would be a challenge -- especially if  
portability was an issue. But if it wasn't challenging it wouldn't be  
interesting or any fun....

just my $.02
