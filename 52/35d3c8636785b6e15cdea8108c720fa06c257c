Well, I had mixed success on a PDP-11/24.

First off, a couple of bugs.

In vtserver.c in the code that loads the bootstrap via console odt, the "C" 
format strings have "%6o".  These need to be changed to "%6.6o" to make it 
work on my 11/24.  Otherwise you get leading spaces.

Also, the code that sends an entire ODT command in one "write()" fails.  I 
had to change that (and the one that sends the "G" command) into a loop 
where I wrote just one character, and then read back one character that the 
11/24 echoed.  Otherwise it just hung.

I suspect both of these changes would fix problems on some machines and 
would not harm any others.

So, I got around that, and the standalone loaded.  (Hooray)  But.....

When I tried to use my RK07 as input ( hk(0,0,0) , I got an error:  sc=1 
cs2=64 er=40  .  Upon examination,  HKCS1 bit 10 was indeed off (indicating 
an RK611 controller) whereas the RK07 bit for the drive at +12(octal) was 
set ON.  So, the error itself is not unreasonable.  But....

I looked at the code in hk.c, and tried it manually after resetting the 
machine, and the code should be getting the expected drive error when it 
first tries to address it as an RK06.  That should cause it to switch to 
thinking it is an RK07, but something is going haywire.  And, if I boot a 
pack, the boot code correctly figures out that it is an RK07 (when I look 
after it reads the boot block off of a garbage pack, Bit 10 in HKCS1 is 
indeed on).

So, my guess is that the code in hk.c is busted in some way.

Are there "2.11BSD for dummies under an emulator" instructions somewhere, 
so that I could hardwire hk.c to an RK07 temporarily?  Or, perhaps can 
someone point me to the physical memory addresses in hk.c so I could just 
patch the array to tell it I have 2 RK07's ahead of time, rather than 
having it attempt to auto-detect the drive type?

Haaaaaaaaaaaaalp  8~)

Jay,
I don't know how to do this and I suspect that it would be very
difficult (someone PLEASE prove me wrong).  But, if you load it into an
emulator using another type of disk, say, an RP05 or RM05 that the
emulator can support, then you can play with hk.c to your heart's
content.  Then you can run the code out and test it on the PDP.

Cheers

Robin

Can RA81/82 disks be reformatted in the field?  If so, is this
done through XXDP or is there a way to do it from the disk's
serial port?

My RA82 occasionally lights its FAULT light and extinguishes its
ready light during write operations.  The likelyhood of it
faulting appears (but I am not certain) to be correlated with a specific
region of the disk.

About five-ten seconds after the fault, the FAULT indicator turns
off and ready comes back on.  At no time is an I/O error generated
that the application or the operating system (2.11BSD) see
so this fault appears to be transient and is resolved by either
the drive or the drive/controller together.

It "smells" like a data write error that's resolved after a few
automatic retries.  I'm hoping a low-level reformat could clear it
up.  Am I wacked out?

If there's an XXDP exerciser/formatter available I'd appreciate it
if someone could point me there.  It's been nearly twenty years since
the last time I even tried running XXDP

Thanks as always,

greg

p.s.  The RA81 drive on the same controller never gives any
trouble (yet).  I've tried some more basic things like
swapping SDI cables and drive ports but it doesn't make
a difference.
