Subject: [TUHS] DEC V7M-11 manuals
Message-ID: <200506211632.j5LGWKQ01623@opihi.ucsd.edu>

While preparing to move out of the office that I have occupied for the
past couple of decades, I came across an unused set of V7M-11 manuals.
Three large binders, DEC Orange (Chinese Red?).  Is this something that
should be archived somewhere?  Scanned and put on line?  I don't have
the resources to do that, but could ship them somewhere.

Labels on the binders are:
V7M-11	Volume 1	Programmer's Manual
V7M-11	Volume 2A and 2B	Programmer's Manual
V7M-11	System Management and Operation Manuals
