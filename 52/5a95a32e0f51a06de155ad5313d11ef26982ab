All of which I have the source for - just looked through it.

    > If memory serves me, tjt wrote the assembler

I have the NROFF source for the "A68 Assembler Reference", and it's by James
L. Gula and Thomas J. Teixeira. It says that "A68 is an edit of the MICAL
assembler also written by Mike [Patrick].".

I dunno, I'm not familiar with PCC, so I can't say. It definitely looks very
different from the Ritchie C compiler.
