You gave me a good hint :)

in 2.11bsd:

cd /usr/src/games/pdp
su
make bj

which does:

as -o bj.o etc.s bj.s us.s
ld -o bj bj.o -lc

the executable seems to work OK.

I tried to assemble it in v5 and it actually does assemble but then
gives "Memory fault -- Core dumped" when trying to run it.

I was wrong about .even, the v5 assembler does understand it. It might
just be easier to modify a later version of bj.c so the v5 compiler
could use it.
