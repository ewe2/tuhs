Hayes may have been later with Fax support, certainly with the 56K stuff, but we had fax support with the slower modems from another manufacturer who's name escapes me now [IIRC it started with a C, they were black and the SW interface was terrible/buggy].   

Okay, nailing it down a bit more, according to my fuzzy memory ...

1982 ish:  1200 bps hayes (the black slab)

1084-5 ish: 2400 bps

1986 ish (telebit trailblazer)

1988 ish: trailblazer 2, v.32

I don't recall commodity FAX modem support until the V.34 stuff started rolling out circa 1994(?).  I'm curious to know of anyone shipping (interoperable) modem FAX bits before then.  I admit to not knowing of anyone or thing using V.17.
