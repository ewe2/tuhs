So.. arnold.. you never used the ! command in ex or vi? because it
will treat a range command as the bounding set of lines to feed into
the command.. if you specify sh or /path/to/shell then its
functionally a cut-paste-exec sequence isn't it?

emacs has the same functionality (in some syntactic suger)

I used fmt all the time in vi, to get <72 for mail in MH. which led me
to find other things you can pipe the editor lines through...
