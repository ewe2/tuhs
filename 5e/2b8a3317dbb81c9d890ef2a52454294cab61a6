Allman told me that Mike O'Malley had an ARPA connection at UCB that was 
axed a few years before the INGRES link. So yes, I think no Arpanet 
connection during the early BSD development work. (Losing this 
connection may have had some controversy, but I don't know the details.)

Fabry told me that O'Malley used Unix for his (EECS) Artificial 
Intelligence research projects before he discovered it (so before the 
October 1973 Symposium).

RFC 402 of Oct 1972 has a ARPA network participant Michael O'Malley of 
University of Michigan Phonetics Laboratory. Also this draft report at 
http://digitalcollections.library.cmu.edu/awweb/awarchive?type=file&item=355330 
about the ARPA speech recognition project lists M. H. O'Malley at UCB 
and says the principle investigator from Univ. of Michigan moved to UCB.  
(I never go ahold of him to see if had any other relevance to my BSD 
story.)
