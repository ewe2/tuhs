Hi Steve, 

whow, what a small world!

The machines were a bit cannibalised over the last decades,
we actually have the boards from both machines, one of them
build into the 19" rack machine. The machine survived the 
closing down of the electronics department, now we're busy
building everything up again...

There's still a Whitesmiths logo attached to the case - this is what
the machine looks like today: http://multicores.org/Codata.jpg
A 5.25" ST412 disk, two 8" SMD disks and a Cypher 9 track tape
are also still there.

Whow, let's keep our fingers crossed that the disks still work...
I haven't tried powering the machine up so far. Unfortunately,
the Interdata no longer exists (what a pity), but the first thing
I will do when the machine is running is to run a full backup. 
Luckily, the Codata has a 5.25" floppy drive, since I no longer 
have easy access to a 9-track SCSI drive (and the last time 
I set up UUCP is far too long ago...).

Actually, quite a number of the people are still here. More off-list.

I only came to Leeds about two months ago - and so far, it's really
great here!
