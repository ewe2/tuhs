A real-life modern example: my wife has a digital camera with a card
that her OS can't read.  So she gives it to me, I take out the card
and read it onto the disk for her, which she then accesses via NFS.
As a result the files belong to me, and to enable her write access, I
have to chmod the directory.  A chown would be more appropriate.

None of this contradicts the issues with allowing non-root chown, but
it does show a valid reason to want to do so.
