Lawrence,

Thanks for the note. Moving /usr to another drive served as both an 
exercise for me to understand how it works and for me to follow the 
advice. Good to know the advice is less applicable to the sim. You were 
correct about the math, duh, 1111 is 15, not 8 :). All good now.

Thanks,

Will

The first was to simply ignore it until after booting into unix and then creating the special files as Ronald describes and then running mkfs:

To put it differently, it doesn't seem correct to me to use 6,1 for the block device or 14,1 for the character device on the new drive as it's a completely different disk from rp0 and rp3 which are just partitions on the first drive and have 6,0, 6,7, and 14,0, 14,7. If each RP can have 8 partitions and there can be 8 drives, what is the correct major, minor numbers to use with v7 for multiple devices?
