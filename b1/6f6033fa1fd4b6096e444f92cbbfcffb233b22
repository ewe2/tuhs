> Delete from Switch Register (delete file whose i-num is in CSR)

There's no doubt that this is right, but
<http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/blog/2008/03/18/a-bit-of-history> claims
that the switch register was set to the number of files to skip over
before dumping core.  If you resumed the core dump, the next file would
be deleted.  This allowed deleting files whose names could not be typed.
