I have built ideal several times over the years. I have
only tested it on the samples in the manual, in particular
the diagram Brian Kernighan used for the 'cbt' documentation.
I believe there was one bug, which was found by John Mackin
at Sydney University many years ago so the code I have has
that documented, well, patched.
