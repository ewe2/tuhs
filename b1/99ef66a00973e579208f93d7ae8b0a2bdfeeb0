I wrote to SCO/Caldera a while back about this one...   Here's a quote 
from the mail I got in reply:

"XENIX will never be released under any license, as it is too full of 
Microsoft copyrights, and "sanitizing" the source to remove such code 
would render the product useless, and would be a MASSIVE undertaking."

Looks like we wont get Xenix in source format unless Microsoft want us to 
have it.

Regards,
Paul.

Would SCO->Caldera have copies of this? SCO did the Intel port of Xenix
so they would probably have started with the PDP source. Would tapes be
copyright to Microsoft?

I doubt that they would release the source for the Intel version as it
is still in use today although I don't think that SCO/Caldera will sell
it anymore.
