Pyramid did something similar, also called universes, in the mid-80s.
I think they used a system call and corresponding command to set
the visible universe either to BSD or System V. I don't remember the
details as to how exactly it worked.

I *think* this was before Dynix, but I'm not sure.

We had a Pyramid when I was working at Georgia Tech. DMR visited one time
and spoke; I remember him saying that he thought what Pyramid had done
was an awful idea... :-) (They were interesting machines. It was RISC,
with loadable microcode... About the same speed as a Vax 780 but half
the price.)
