I think it's reasonably well-documented that Flowers understood things =
about making valves (tubes) reliable that were not previously known: =
Colossus was well over ten times larger than any previous valve-based =
system at the time and there was huge scepticism about making it work, =
to the extent that he funded the initial one substantially himself as BP =
wouldn't.  For instance he understood that you should never turn the =
things off: even quite significant maintenance was done on Colossi with =
them on (I believe they were kept on even when the room flooded on =
occasion, which led to fairly exciting electrical conditions).  He also =
did things with heaters (the heater voltage was ramped up & down to =
avoid thermal stresses when powering things on or off) and other tricks =
such as soldering the valves into their bases to avoid connector =
problems.

The mechanical part (the tape reader) was in fact one significant reason =
for Colossus: the previous thing, Heath Robinson, had used two tapes =
which needed to be kept in sync (or, rather, needed to be allowed to =
drift out of sync in a controlled way with respect to each other), and =
this did not work well at all as the tapes would stretch & break.  =
Colossus generated one of the tapes (the one corresponding to the Lorenz =
machine's settings) electronically and would then sync itself to the =
tape with the message text on it.

It's also not the case that the Colossi did only one thing: they were =
not general-purpose machines but they were more general-purpose than =
they needed to be and people found all sorts of ways of getting them to =
compute properties they had not originally been intended to compute.  I =
remember talking to Donald Michie about this (he was one of the members =
of the Newmanry which was the bit of BP where the Colossi were).

There is a paper, by Flowers, in the Annals of the History of Computing =
which discusses a lot of this.  I am not sure if it's available online =
(or where my copy is).

Further, of course, you can just ask people who run one about =
reliability: there's a reconstructed one at TNMOC which is well worth =
seeing (there's a Heath Robinson as well), and the people there are very =
willing to talk about reliability -- I learnt about the =
heater-voltage-ramping thing by asking what the huge rheostat was for, =
and later seeing it turned on in the morning -- one of the problems with =
the reconstruction is that they are required to to turn it off at night =
(this is the same problem that afflicts people who look after steam =
locomotives. which in real life would almost never have been allowed to =
get cold).

As I said, I don't want to detract from Whirlwind in any way, but it is =
the case that Tommy Flowers did sort out significant aspects of the =
reliability of relatively large valve systems.
