Gregg,

Yes.  They are a cut-and-paste log of my actual screens, although I
can't
remember exactly what was in the file.

I did installs on real hardware (MicroPDP-11/23 and MicroPDP-11/83), and
on Ersatz-11 (V3.0) for DOS.

Ultrix-11 runs fine on SimH, with the "downs" that because SimH does not
do detailed and correct CPU emulation, Ultrix gets confuzed every now
and
then, which does not happen with E11.

I am preparing a new (V3.2) release of Ultrix-11 which has major
changes,
including:

- full system regeneration off single source tree
- full RAxx support
- addition of VTserver, TDU and compress
- compressed manual pages and documentation
- Y2K support (not just date(1) ;-)

The installation procedure has also changed to a more modern style.  I
don't have much time right now, so progress is slow.  The above is
"done",
though.

If you need help with Ultrix-11, pse contact me off-list.
