That's an interesting solution.  Configuring it to not modify the
Subject: line by adding "[TUHS] " to it would probably also work.  :)

Also, it seems from my logs that every list item that's been refused at
my end over the last couple of weeks has been from someone in the domain
"tnetconsulting.net".  It might be interesting to see what's special
about mail from that subscriber.

A random sample:
