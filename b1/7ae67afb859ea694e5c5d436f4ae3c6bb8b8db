Well, I think one or the other would be desirable.  I figured -a was the 
better to keep - since it shows all dotfiles where -A leaves off . and .. 
.

Of course. ;)

-h is a gnuism, isn't it?

https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/ls.html does 
specify the -S switch.  That's POSIX, isn't it?

Understandable.

Honestly if the date format weren't standardized as it were, I would've 
standardized on "yyyy-mm-dd,mm:ss" - which wouldn't need special 
processing in order to pump into sort(1).

Perhaps true.

I was using the link I referenced as my "standard", which doesn't have any 
of those.

I can take or leave color ls.  I don't like the GNU defaults because dark 
blue is TOO dark on my default settings.  I think the flags are adequate 
to know what kind of file I'm dealing with.

I used to use "dir|sort" a lot on PC DOS before it got "dir /o" in 5.0.  I 
wouldn't have a problem with removing sort from ls altogether.

-uso.
