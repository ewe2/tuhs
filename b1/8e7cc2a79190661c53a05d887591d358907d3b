Subject: [TUHS] Plan 9/Inferno Manuals?

Anyone got Plan 9 4th edition manuals or Inferno Manuals? I will be
interested to buy them. Vitanuova used to sell them, but their payment
system is down for years now and has been brought up to Charles many
times, but it seem to be still down, so there is no way to buy it from
them.
