Hi,

I found SIMH really handy as opposed to a real VAX. Was the only
way I could bring my VAX 6460 to boot Ultrix 4.5 which I only had
on a CD and the standalone kernel that came with Ultrix 4.5 didn't
support the KA64A although the normal generic Ultrix 4.5 kernel
does. So, I made a small disk installed a generic root partition
on SIMH used an uVAX-II under NetBSD to pull the disk image via
NFS to a TK50 and then booted VAX 6460 under VMS and wrote the
disk image to RA90 and off I went. I couldn't have done it without
SIMH :-)

Anyway, to your problem:

this suspiciously looks as if the HALT is from SIMH not from the
VAX it simulates. There are two halt levels in SIMH, one being
the VAX halting and going into VAX console mode, the other being
SIMH halting. Are you absolutely sure that you have a proper
VAX console with SIMH? You should get normal VAX console
behavior, try a few commands and see whether you're on the right
page.

Also, be sure you have it all configured right, that you have
the right devices defined and properly associated with files
on the hosting OS etc.

I would agree. What other system can you boot on SIMH?

again, your SIMH configuration may be screwed up. I definitely could
boot Ultrix 4.5.
