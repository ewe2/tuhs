PS:

    > IIRC, outbound packets are copied into kernel buffers

IDRC; according to the documentation, outbound packets are DMA'd directly from
user memory. I have yet to read the code to verify this.

There is indeed a PTY driver; it has comments from BBN'ers who edited it, so
perhaps we got it from BBN.

The 'simple' TCP.

So I found a long list of people we sent tapes to. Oh well....

Well, maybe... Here is the output of 'size' on the last Unix image for that
machine:

   40560+3098+44594

It was a /45, so split I/D (no overlays, though). How much could be trimmed
out of that, I'm not sure.
