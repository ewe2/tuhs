All, 

Yes, I saw the "rights" declaration (with a non-zero switch register) on
a real machine (PDP-11/34a with programmer's panel), when I booted Ken's
v6 distribution in single-user mode (there is a specific value you enter
into the register, 173030, as documented in bproc.8; does anyone know
why this value was used?).  

I'm not sure why, but I was never able to get Dennis' distribution to
boot in the emulator; as a result, I didn't take the time to copy it
over to an RK05 (using Warren's excellent tools) to boot on the 11/34.

No, the other way round: The tape you provided is from October 10th and
the disk image provided by Dennis is from July 18th. The "RESTRICED
RIGHT"- remark was put into the kernel on October 10th. It is on the
tape that you provided, it is not on the disk image from Dennis.  But
the source code from the Lions book shows this remark as well.

I don't know who changed main.c on October 10th 1975 (I lived in Israel
at that time)

You see the remark only if you set the switch register on the PDP-11 to
a nonzero value befor booting. I installed V6 from the tape following
the setup instructions. With the Supnik simulator, enter
	sim > d sr 1
	sim > boot rk0
	@rkunix

And it will print your rights!
