I hope this whole topic doesn't go off the rails â€“ we've had enough of those on the list the past couple of weeks.

But I will note that, if the sites that enforce the fully-anal interpretation of DMARC start destroying the list, it's completely within the spirit of TUHS to migrate to a UUCP-only distribution.  (Note the deliberate absence of a smiley.)
