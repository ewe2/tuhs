Solar cells are costly.
No, please do not say zero xy when you are using electronics.
They are anything else but zero cost, not when their resources are
captured, not when they or their assembly lines are built, not when
they are shipped, not when they are used.

Sorry if i bug you, but this day noble prices where given to
people who improved batteries.  Batteries are ok, but we just
started the next race for rare earth and resources, instead of
looking to a really sustainable future.

After i have given up on being smart and started to use very long
passwords, entire sentences when i have to type them,

  LC_ALL=3DC tr -cd 'a-zA-Z0-9_.,=3D@%^+-'

otherwise, i am now in the position to nag web and other
interfaces here and there which restrict password lengths to 8 or
so, and/or which restrict the allowed content.
Now in public.
