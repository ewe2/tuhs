so not the original SOSP paper or the original 1974 CACM paper :-)

However, it's yet another version of the paper.

I've spent some time tracking down the various "versions" of this paper.
So far, I know of:

+ the mid-1971 draft, available at https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/McIlroy_v0/UnixEditionZero-Threshold_OCR.pdf
+ a later version which is in the Nokia Bell Labs archives, which I 
  haven't been able to get my hands on
+ the SOSP presentation, still unclear if there was an actual paper
+ the 1974 CACM paper
+ the version in 6th Edition Unix, available at https://minnie.tuhs.org//cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V6/usr/doc/unix
+ the 1978 BSTL version cited above

Are there any others that people know about that I've missed?

I would like to do some work on how the content changed over time.
The result would be, for me, an interesting paper to read but somehow
I think the readership base would be limited :-)

Cheers, Warren
