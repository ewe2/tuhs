DEC had mostly learned it lesson that interface standards were better shared.  Iâ€™ve forgotten now the name of the person who lead the team.  I did not know him very well.  I can picture his face as I said.

It's just that this sounds so much like the TURBOchannel (not Turbobus 
as I wrote previously). That bus exactly matches your description of 
details, timelines and circumstances, while the PCI, to my knowledge 
don't match at all.

And my recollection also matches Wikipedia, which even gives the PCI 
V1.0 spec being released in 1992. (See 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_PCI)

Compare to TURBOchannel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TURBOchannel
