1942 would be the Z3, the first computer ever. The Z3 that is in the
Deutsches Museum is AFAIK a rebuild of the original one. (Rebuild under
the supervision of Konrad Zuse himself.) I don't know if the Z4 is still
around. Google for "Konrad Zuse" and / or his son "Horst Zuse". Horst
Zuse has put much effort in documenting the work of his father.

I know that there is a Zuse Z23 in Karlsruhe. It was build in 1956,
based on electron tubes, core and drum memory and it is still fully
functional!
