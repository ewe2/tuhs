What was amusing was seeing what I thought was a copy tucked away on the
shelves of Kirk McKusick's library, next to weird things with odd labels
like "BSD 4.5" (really something between what we know as BSD 4.0 and BSD
4.1 when the notion was the next BSD release tape would be called BSD5)
next to more mundane ones like "V6" and "V32" etc. It's definitely a piece
of folklore that turns up in the oddest places...
