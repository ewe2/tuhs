And how is that different than the Intel line of CPU's? Backward 
compatibility, while adding features as it progressed.

The KA10, KI10, KL10, KS10 all added something to the mix that their 
predecessors did not have.

To call something a "clone" infers a second party making as close of a 
copy as possible to the original. The KA10 was not a "clone" of a PDP-6.
