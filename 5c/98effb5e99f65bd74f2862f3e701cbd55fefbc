The OS/2 Museum claims at [1] that the network redirector was added in
3.0. I'd expect INTERLNK/INTERSVR to need redirector support, and if
that assumption is correct, those wouldn't work on any pre-3.0
versions of Microsoft's DOS (whether MS-DOS or PC-DOS), and support
may be spotty on versions earlier than the one where they were
introduced depending on which exact features are used.

Also, a cursory glance at a MS-DOS 3.1 user's manual and user's
reference that I have lying around does not list INTERLNK/INTERSRV in
the command reference, so those would presumably have come later than
that. Wikipedia appears to confirm this at [2] by claiming they were
introduced in PC-DOS 5.02 / MS-DOS 6.0; the cited source at [3], [4]
simply says "6.0 and later" without specifying a variant.

So, almost certainly not that easy, unfortunately.
