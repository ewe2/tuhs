Thanks a lot for all your responses. They helped and encouraged me.

This is what I found out so far:

1) cut was part of System III. The sources are online:
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=SysIII/usr/src/cmd/cut.c
In consequence, cut was part of PWB 3.0, as well, because that's
the same.

2) These sources of (presumely) PWB 1.0 show no signs of cut:
http://minnie.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/usdl/

3) I couldn't find any sources or useful documentation about PWB 2.0.

4) I've discovered that cut was present in CB Unix 2.1 (which I
haven't even known it existed. ;-) ). I found scanned man pages,
which date November 1979:
ftp://sunsite.icm.edu.pl/pub/unix/UnixArchive/PDP-11/Distributions/other/CB_Unix/cbunix_man1_02.pdf
(cut is on PDF page 57)
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find sources or, actually, much
useful information at all on CB Unix.


Possibly, you can help me a further step from this point on.

I think, interesting would be sources or docs about PWB 2.0 and
CB Unix and the relation i.e. code transfer between PWB and CB Unix.
