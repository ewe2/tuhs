A variation of C.A.R.Hoare's quip in his 1973 paper "Hints on
Programming Language Design" 

  The more I ponder the principles of language design, and
  the techniques which put them into practice, the more is my
  amazement and admiration of ALGOL 60. Here is a language so
  far ahead of its time, that it was not only an improvement
  on its predecessors, but also on nearly all its successors.
