And was really really expensive, which is why we had DJ-11s instead, hence 
our rapture on the coming of the DZ-11.

Oh, and I'm a software person, with a good knowledge of hardware (I was 
forever trying to tell the hardware bods that it was their problem and not 
mine, and I practically had to rub their noses in it).

DEC used to fob us off because we ran Unix; it was only when DECEX became 
available that the overlapped-seeks issue on the RK-11 was finally 
acknowledged, as RSX/RSTS didn't use that feature, and MAINDEC didn't prod 
it.
