SRI, UCSD, UCLA, Utah:

All West Coast, plus Utah. Next was BBN; if you look at the IMP numbers, in
HOSTS.TXT, they were assigned in order of installation.

No:

1977 was not too many years before the peak in size (with the MILNET split
coming in October, 1983). Per:

  http://www.chiappa.net/~jnc/tech/arpanet.html

"Prior to the split, in 1983, there were 113 IMPs in the ARPANET; after the
ARPANET/MILNET split, the MILNET consisted of 65 nodes, leaving the ARPANET
with 68 nodes."
