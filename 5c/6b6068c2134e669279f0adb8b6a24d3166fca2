if you only want to log-in into a system that has
already been generated, you find the instructions
to do this in my package. In case you want to setup
a new system from the tape files, you can find the
complete set of V7 manuals here:
http://plan9.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/
with vol2/setup being the document you are looking for.
Formats include PDF, PostScript, and troff source.

Hellwig
