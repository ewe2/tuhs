My first job out of college was at a company (1986ish) that did seismic and m=
eteorological modeling and monitoring.  At college we were on csnet ( on our=
 Vax, running BSD 4.2 ).  At work, I was deliriously happy to have my own Su=
n 3/110 to work on, vs having to fight to share the Vax.  However,  I was ha=
ving email and Usenet withdrawal... so after completing a 6 month scheduled t=
ask In about a month ( thank you lex and yacc :-) ) I was looking for things=
 to fill the time and asked my boss about email. He said, well there is this=
 dedicated line up to Virginia that he used every once in a month and checke=
d his email.. and sometimes helped the seismologists pull some data.  He tho=
ught the folks on the other end might be able to help.  He gave me the name a=
nd phone number - it was Rick Adams. ( and yes, this was a dedicated circuit=
 into seismo... well the Annex box physically right next to it :-) ).=20

Shall we say, I called fairly quickly, and was working with David Comay who h=
elped support things there ( the center for seismic studies - css ) and got a=
n early version of CSLIP...  Then excitedly ( though a tad nervously) learne=
d how to rebuild a Sun 3/110 kernel and get it installed. =20

The newsfeed and email speed, shall we say, didn=E2=80=99t suck =F0=9F=99=82=


Oh, and btw, seismo wasn=E2=80=99t uunet.  The original uunet was a sequent 8=
 processor box ( I believe ). One of my trips to DC I got to visit with Davi=
d and saw the box as it was there at css with seismo. ( if memory serves me,=
 it was in Ricks office ).  Rick had gotten permission to host it there to =E2=
=80=9Csee if there was a business model for providing internet access=E2=80=9D=
, which now I think we can definitely answer yes :-)=20

There still is a seismo, but obviously the box isn=E2=80=99t the sun 3/2xx s=
eries machine it was then.=20
