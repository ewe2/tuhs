In the 90sh DEC in Europe had a number of products on top of SCO UNIX
3.2V4.2 calling DECadvantage (from the German part of former Philips
Information Systems). Included were an SNA environment with 3270
display/print, 3770/RJE, and APPC. I've used RJE for downloading daily
reports in one of the banks here in Thailand. Long time ago though.
Still have various sample scripts I put together that time.
