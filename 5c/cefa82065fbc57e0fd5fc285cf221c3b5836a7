Subject: [TUHS] OT: Grace Hopper, Unix epoch, ARPAnet converted to TCP/IP
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.21.1801010927100.99776@aneurin.horsfall.org>

Some interesting historical stuff today...

We lost Rear Admiral Dr. Grace Hopper USN (Retd) in 1992; there's not much 
more than can be said about her, but I will mention that she received 
(posthumously) the Presidential Medal of Honor in 2016.

As every Unix geek knows, today is the anniversary of The Epoch[tm] back 
in 1970, and at least one nosey web site thinks that that is my birthdate 
too...

And according to my notes, the ARPAnet got converted from NCP to TCP/IP in 
1983; do any greybeards here have a more precise date?
