Subject: [TUHS] licence of ditroff?
Message-ID: <Pine.BSO.4.61L.0410261228540.12995@thor.66h.42h.de>

Hi!

I would like to know which licence the files at
http://medialab.dyndns.org/~martin/tape/stuff/ditroff/
are under.

If it's http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Caldera-license.pdf
that would be nice, if not, is there any way to find
out whose (c) is on the files, and how to contact them?

Reason: I'm developer of a BSD offspring and already
integrated 4.4BSD-Alpha nroff, neqn, tbl etc. under the
Caldera licence above into our operating system in order
to get rid of the less free, written in C++, GNU groff.
With success. Now I'm lacking postscript output.

Thanks in advance,
//mirabile
