This behaviour differed between platforms, unix using the common approach,
and some other platforms simplying making it a (non common) symbol in the bss.

Having learnt C in its pre-ANSI form on unix, I then ran in to this behaviour
on DOS C compilers.  None of which (that I came across) providing the 'common'
behaviour.
