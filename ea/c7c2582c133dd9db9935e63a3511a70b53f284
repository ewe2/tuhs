It had the 9 files that were trivial to replicate removed, yes.

Both FreeBSD and NetBSD took different approaches to getting a bootable
system, and to fixing many of the issues in 4.4BSD. While these are close,
the 386BSD releases from Jolitz might be closer still (though technically
based on net2 releases, the delta between that and 4.4 kernel I ).
http://gunkies.org/wiki/386_BSD has pointers to the releases (including
mirrors in TUHS). 386bsd.org doesn't seem to have them, though there's lots
of pointers to the Dr Dobb's articles.
