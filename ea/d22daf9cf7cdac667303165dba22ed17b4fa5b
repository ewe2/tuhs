Ahh, that makes sense.  So if we build with the 1ed "as" then those
first few lines should be commented out since they will be occupied
by the a.out header.  Ahh!  yess, it makes sense, e00-02 has
a section at orig+400 "copy in transfer fectors" where those
vectors are overwritten during startup.

We really should try building with the 1ed assembler.  I think a simple 
sed s/mount/xmount/ over the whole sources will probably fix the mount 
label issue.
