The UNIVAC has a quite rich "partial word" format encoded in the pointers.    The HEP as well used the low order bits to switch the operand size as well as the offset into the word.

The PDP-10 had arbitrarily sized byte pointers! Did anybody ever implement a C compiler on that hardware?

As DIGEX teased the VAX weenies at DECUS:

“If you’re not playing with 36 bits, you’re not playing with a full DEC!"
