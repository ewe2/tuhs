In case people are wondering, I found this
https://www.quora.com/What-is-Unix-and-why-is-it-important which contains a
blue-oval chart that shows it being derived from CB Unix 3. But that the
sources were also different than the ones for VAXen, etc. At least that's
the implication here. Is this chart in error?
