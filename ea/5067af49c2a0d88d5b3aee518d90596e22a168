As you will have been told, it is supported, quite well in fact.  I have 
run 11/73s and 83s from TK50 and TMSCP exabyte drives for years and they 
work a treat.

You really need the maketape program.  You can then dd and tar the rest 
on to the tape but the initial step needs to be done the "official" way. 
To repeat a question already asked, where are you.  If you really can't 
get over this then someone nearby can hopefully cut you a tape.

Cheers

Robin
