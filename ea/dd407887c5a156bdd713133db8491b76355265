I could not have told you date, but I do remember when you sent it ber and
myself, specifically.

There has been some amusing coverage of the "25th anniversary of the email
attachment", commemorating Nat Borenstien's creation of MIME in 1992.
And his scheme does not work on IBM Mainframes or 6-bit machine as is (Nat
required an 8 bit path).  Your scheme passed through all known systems at
the time.

Can't say I know the proper way to do that, other than to say thank you and
acknowledge the hack as a darned creative solution to an issue a lot of us
had.
