There's a binary of dc from either 1st or 2nd Edition in the PUPS Archive:

	-r---wxrw- 0/0            6846 Apr 14 06:50 1973 bin/dc

Hmmm... did the permissions on files have the same meaning back in 1973 as
they do now?  Group and "other" writeable system binaries?  Tsk tsk tsk.

Well I suppose just because someone has written the Unix operating system,
it doesn't necessarily mean that they're a very good Unix sysadmin.

No, the perms have got stuffed up in conversion from 1st Ed permissions
to the tar archive. 1st Edition had no groups, and only had perms 

	01 write for other
	02 read for other
	04 write for owner		[ all octal values ]
	10 read for owner
	20 executable
	40 set-UID

I don't believe the concept of group permissions existed then...

On the other hand, people actually trusted each other, because you
all worked with each other, and it was common for someone to write a
utility and stick it on the system.  Hint: /usr wasn't called that for
no reason...
