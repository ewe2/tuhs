(sorry for the slow response) I seem to have lost some messages, so
I'm not longer sure what Larry's suggesting to mirror.  Also it's not
as if I have much to say for the FreeBSD project any more, though I'm
surprised imp didn't say anything.  Isn't this a matter for the
FreeBSD core team and whoever is running ftp.freebsd.org at the
moment?  I certainly don't see any obvious reason why not.
