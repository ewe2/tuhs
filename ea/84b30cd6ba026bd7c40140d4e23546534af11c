Hello All.

Believed lost in the mists of time for over 30 years, the Georgia Tech
Software Tools Subsystem for Prime Computers, along with the Georgia Tech
C Compiler for Prime Computers, have been recovered!

The source code and documentation (and binary files) are available in a
Github repo: https://github.com/arnoldrobbins/gt-swt.

The README.md there provides some brief history and credits with respect
to the recovery, and w.r.t. the subsystem and C compilers themselves.

Credit to Scott Lee for making and keeping the tapes and driving the
recovery process, and to Dennis Boone and yours truly for contributing
financially.  I set up the repo.

For anyone who used and/or contributed to this software, we hope you'll
enjoy this trip down memory lane.

Feel free to forward this note to interested parties.

Enjoy,

Arnold Robbins
(On behalf of the swt recovery team. :-)
