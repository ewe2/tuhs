IIRC, that _was_ a common trick at least on machines of that class. It
did have the potential to save a few bytes, yes (more if the
instructions were such that you'd get some _other, desired_, behavior
by jumping into the middle of one with some specific state), but it
also foiled lots of disassemblers: Simply disassembling a binary from
start to finish would yield nonsense in those locations, as you
experienced. It thus basically forced you to single-step those
instructions to figure out what was going on from the binary.

I'm pretty sure it works on every architecture with variable-length
instructions and arbitrary jump capability, as long as you have
control over the specific machine instructions generated (such as if
you are programming in assembler). Of course, it _is_ also a total
nightmare to maintain such code.

I would absolutely not say that doing something like that is standard
practice in modern programming. Even in microcontrollers, where
program and data memory can be scarce even today, I would argue that
the costs would not outweigh the benefits by a long shot.
