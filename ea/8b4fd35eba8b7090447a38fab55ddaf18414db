I had BDS C for my Z-80 box (the Australian 128Kb Microbee with 
bank-switched memory), and hated it, as it barely understood C.  $BOSS 
then bought me Hi-Tech C, and it was full ANSI, to my surprise (that's 
when I found the TMPFS M: drive stuff from somewhere).

I ported a few programs over that way (GREP etc, but damned slow, and I'll 
probably get told that it couldn't possibly have worked[*]), but now all 
sadly lost, alas.

[*]
I have a long history of doing the impossible, mostly because I was the 
only one dumb enough to actually try it.
