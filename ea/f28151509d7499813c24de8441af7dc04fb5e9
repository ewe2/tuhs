i would like to see plan9 source for the 1st and 2nd editions if p9 on the tuhs archive - assuming the community would accept it.

the 3rd edotion was a snapshot and is public and the 4th is still in use (a little)

I can get access to the 1st ed (universities only) and am a 2nd ed licensee but it would be great if the lawyers where to allow those to be opened.

Russ Cox did a fantastic online history/diff - though the only copy i could find was in the wayback machine:
