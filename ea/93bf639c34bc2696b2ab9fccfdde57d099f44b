Steve Holmgren and the Arpanet Unix team are still around (at least they =
were 3 years ago). I just remembered that I put some of my notes & =
findings in a draft wiki that I wanted to develop for TUHS - but I never =
finished it:

The recent find of CSRG report 3 and 4 may be the incentive I needed to =
complete my notes about 4.1a, 4.1c and 4.2BSD. However, still looking =
for the actual source tape to 4.1a - the closest I have is its =
derivative in 2.9BSD =
