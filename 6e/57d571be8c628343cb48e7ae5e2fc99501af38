I'm the one that wrote that walk-through. The challenge was very
frustrating because MESS didn't/doesn't allow double-density media in
high-density drives and the images I had to work with were a mix of
both. Also, the one bootable image supported only one floppy drive and
had no mknod. But I did win $100 for being the first to get it to
compile and run a certain program. Yay! Back in the day I had always
wanted Venix so it was nice finally getting to do something with it and
make money doing it.
