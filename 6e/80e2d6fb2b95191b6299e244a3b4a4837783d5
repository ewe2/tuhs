From my notes:

After graduating, Leffler got a job in the Silicon Valley
at Sytek, a small firm in Sunnyvale.
% CITE: archives/csrg-archives/disk1/mnt/2.79/usenet/netdir/sites/sytek
They used a PDP 11/45 and moved to a VAX 11/750 running VM/UNIX
with four 300 baud ACU's (Automatic Call Units aka ``modems``) ---
they marketed a broadband network to
connect thousands of stations using coaxial cable over a distance
of 40 miles.

Since they were using a VAX and he had kept in touch with Joy, he was
a beta-test site for 4BSD.\cite{salus1994}

% NOTE: not to take over since no Sun then
Leffler went to Berkeley to work with Joy\cite{billshannon2} in the
fall of 1981.\cite{salus1994}.
