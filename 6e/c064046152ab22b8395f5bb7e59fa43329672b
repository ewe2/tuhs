Unless someone already replied and I didn't read it yet:

NIS/YP is different than NIS+. NIS/YP is the old protocol. You could 
basically bind to any server with the correct domain name, and look at 
all the maps including passwd with it's encrypted passwords.

NIS+ is the hierarchical, encrypted, clients-need-keys, protocol.

Almost two entirely different things. And "almost" is more like 
99.99999999999999999% different :)

      The encryption would thwart snooping.  But it doesn't sound like
      that would prevent a properly authenticated client from ypcating
      too much information.
