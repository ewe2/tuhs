According to the reconstructed kernel sources, it had both. I'm unsure
about the button detail.

I've no looked at this detail, but I think it had its own keyboard
independent of a tty 33. We have the sources so we can look. They will be
the final answer on this anyway.

Yes.

You can look at the simh simulator to find where this is described. We know
there's one pdp-7 with the PDP-9 disk drive from the 18-bit service log
that was printed in 1972 available from bitsavers.org. It is excerpted
here: https://www.soemtron.org/downloads/decinfo/18bitservicelist1972.pdf for
details. Serial number 34 was Ken's PDP-7. I have a blog entry on that
here: https://bsdimp.blogspot.com/2019/07/the-pdp-7-where-unix-began.html that
describes things in some detail.

Private email from Ken earlier this year said that there were 2 PDP-9s and
3 PDP-15s at Bell Labs that ran pdp7 Unix at one time or another. There are
other instances sprinkled through the early newsletters I've been reading
lately, but they aren't greppable and I don't have the time to look at them
all again (including a couple of cases where it was said that Ken brought
things up on a PDP-9, which we know to be in error).

It's the first version, but the 1st edition manual definitely describes the
PDP-11/20 port.

We know that it was a 11/20, initially without an MMU, and later with a
custom hacked MMU, which I think is the KS-11. Clem would know :)

PDP 11/45 support was added as part of the efforts for the 4th edition.
bitsavers has a couple of interesting sets of notes from lectures at the
time: http://bitsavers.org/pdf/bellLabs/unix/ has the interesting bits
(including the sources used to reconstruct the 1st edition kernel we have
in TUHS in the kernel routine documentation).

I'm unsure. I didn't research those details.
