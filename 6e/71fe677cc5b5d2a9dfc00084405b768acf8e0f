In 1972, while in high school, I went to an Intel seminar on the 8008. 
There I met a Bell Labs scientist who gave me a sample 8008 and invited 
me for a visit at some NJ Bell Labs facility. That group had a 
timesharing system of some kind, but it was not Unix. I was also given a 
Bell Labs speech synthesis kit after meeting one of the speech 
scientists who happened to be in on the same Saturday. I have searched 
my attic but can't find further details. Would any of you alumni recall 
what this other timesharing system might have been?
