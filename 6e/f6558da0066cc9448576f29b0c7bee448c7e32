Many, many eons ago, in the early '90's, there was an implementation of B for Linux ( I believe it was written in C, ironically enough ).  I think it was part of a bigger collection of "ancient" software for Linux that use to be around in the early Slackware days.

Alas, I have searched for it in the recent past, as I was thinking about porting it to OS X for kicks, but it seems to have vanished.

Having an B, implemented in a modern language for a modern OS would be cool.ï»¿
