I noted with much pleasure that the main bitsavers site is back up, and =
that at some point it has added a full set of scans of =E2=80=9CDatamation=
=E2=80=9D. The Feb 1975 issue contains an article from Dr. Fraser about =
Spider and the network setup in Murray Hill early in 1975:
http://bitsavers.org/pdf/datamation/197502.pdf

For ease of reference I have also temporarily put the relevant 4 pages =
of the issue here:
https://gitlab.com/pnru/spider/blob/master/spider.pdf

I find the graphic that shows how Spider connected machines and =
departments the most interesting, as it helps understand how the pro=E2=80=
=99s and con=E2=80=99s of Arpa Unix might have been perceived at that =
time.

The more I read, the more confused I become whether the =E2=80=9CPierce =
loop=E2=80=9D was a precursor to =E2=80=9CSpider=E2=80=9D or a parallel =
effort.

The facts appear to be that John Pierce =
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Pierce) submitted his paper to =
BSTJ in December 1970, essentially describing a loop network with fixed =
size short datagrams, suggesting T1 frames. It is quite generic. In =
February 1971 W.J. Kropfl submits a paper that describes an =
implementation of the ideas in the Pierce paper with actual line =
protocols and a TIU. In October 1971 C.H. Coker describes in a 3rd paper =
how to interact with this TIU from a H516 programming perspective.

Several Spider papers mention that the project was started in 1969 and =
that the first Spider link was operational in 1972. The team appears to =
be entirely different: the h/w is credited to Condon and Weller, and the =
s/w to Frazer, Jensen and Plaugher. The Spider TIU is much more complex =
(200 TTL chips vs. 50 in the Kropfl TIU). The main reason for that - at =
first glance - appears to be that in the Spider network the TIU handled =
guaranteed in order delivery (i.e managed time outs and =
retransmissions), whereas in the Kropfl implementation this was left to =
the hosts.

It would seem logical that the latter was an evolution of the former, =
having been developed at the same site at the same time. A 1981 book =
seems to take that view as well: =E2=80=9CLocal Computer Network =
Technologies=E2=80=9D by Carl Tropper includes the text "Spider Spider =
is an experimental data communications network which was built at the =
Bell Telephone Laboratories (Murray Hill, New Jersey) under the =
direction of A. G. Fraser. A detailed description of the network is =
given by Fraser [FRAS74]. This network was built with the notion of =
investigating Pierce's idea of ...=E2=80=9D The chapter is titled =E2=80=9C=
The Pierce loop and its derivatives=E2=80=9D. This is a much as Google =
will give me - if somebody has the book please let me know.

On the other hand, the Spider papers do not mention the Kropfl network =
or Pierce=E2=80=99s paper at all. The graphic in Datamation appears to =
show two Kropfl loops as part of the network setup. Yet, this is =
described in the accompanying text as "4. Honeywell 5l6: Supports =
research into comunications techniques and systems. The machine has a =
serial loop I/O bus threaded through several labs at Murray Hill. =
Equipment under test is connected either directly to the bus or to a =
minicomputer which is then connected to the bus. Also avail- able are =
graphics display terminals and a device that can write read-only memory =
chips.=E2=80=9D Maybe this is a different bus, but if it is the same as =
the Kropfl loop, to call it a =E2=80=9Cserial loop I/O bus=E2=80=9D =
suggests it was a parallel effort unrelated to Spider.

Does anybody on the list recall whether Spider was a parallel effort or =
a continuation of the earlier work?
