Aha. Great. Thanks. Yes, BIS and BIC on the PSW obviously works, but 
this would definitely not block interrupts for the next instruction. So 
at least in that case, a WAIT could result in the kernel sitting around 
waiting for the next interrupt. I don't really think DEC intend WAIT to 
be used in the way Unix uses it, and it don't really have the properties 
that would be ideas for Unix. Also somewhat indicated by the fact that 
DEC did not use WAIT this way themselves.
