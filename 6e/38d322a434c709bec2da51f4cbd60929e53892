I'm only just catching up with this thread, but I'm surprised that
nobody else pointed out that SCO is the same company that released
"ancient UNIX" under a free license in January 2002.  Given SCO's
behaviour, that doesn't guarantee that they won't cause problems, but
it should severely limit the scope.
