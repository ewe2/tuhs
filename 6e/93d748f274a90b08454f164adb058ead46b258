sci-hub.

I recently was looking for a bunch of papers - some as old as 40 years.

sci-hub had them all.

This is fantastic. My old modus operandi of making a list and going to =
the Stanford Math library to browse, copy or download them using =
Stanford's electronic subscription to the desired journals no longer=20
works as:

  1) The math library no longer exists
  2) The trend at Stanford is to house paper books and journals off-site =
in Livermore somewhere. All the libraries seem to be going paperless, =
err, bookless...
  3) They only seem to subscribe to a subset of ACM, SIAM, etc. online
