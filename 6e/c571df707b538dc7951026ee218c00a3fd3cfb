In McKusick's piece, Twenty Years of Berkeley Unix, I get one perspective, and from Sokolov's Quasijarus project, I get quite another. In terms of popularity and in terms of stable performance, what say you? Was 4.1 that much better than 4BSD? Was 4.1as obsolete immediately as McKusick says? 4.1b sounds good with FFS, was it? 4.1c's the last pre 4.2 release, but it sounds like it was nearly a beta version of 4.2...

My recollection from 1997 or 1998 is that Sokolov appeared out of nowhere, alone, with (as someone else in this thread best put it) a "revolutionary zeal", and decided to create Quasijarus with the specific goal of supporting VAXen beyond the models that had been originally supported under 4.2. Sokolov was 18 or 19 at the time, so I can certainly understand the revolutionary zeal (I miss mine!). Beyond that, I don't think anything else ever came out of it.
