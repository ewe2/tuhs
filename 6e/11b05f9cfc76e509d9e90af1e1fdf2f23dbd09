These are interesting bits that add to the flavor of what we know already.
Thank you for taking the time to write this up...

One interesting thing from this. Your UNIX 370 port was started before the
Wollongong Interdata port. Your work on Unix 370 started in August of '75,
but the Wollongong port started in November '76 and was put into production
in July '77.

And we have the TSS/370 port described in the BSTJ, and the Bell Lab's
Intersil 8/32 port. It makes me wonder what other porting efforts had
started in the 75-78 time frame....
