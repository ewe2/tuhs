Eunice post-dated DEC's first Unix offering by several years. They sold V7
and later V7M before rebranding it to Ultrix. Eunice was 4.1BSD (later 4.2
and 4.3) that Dr  Kashtan grafted into VMS in ways that... provoke strong
feelings among reviewers...  The TCP/IP stack that was inside of Eunice
would form the basis for Wollongong's TCP/IP offerings on VMS... A more
refined version, also done I think by Kashtan, was marketed by TGV and
there was always much rivalry between the two companies...

Wollongong got its license because they were the marketing company formed
to market Dr. Miller's port to Interdata, and they later branched out
significantly because their license was so special...  Or at least that's
the story they told customers and internally... I never saw the original
license to know...
