Now I enjoy reading through the book. Thereby I came across this
piece of information (section 7.3.3, p. 87):

	(Historically, f stands for ``facts'', but most people
	prefer to think of it as an abbreviation for ``file''.)

Why ``facts''?


The manpage in 1st Edition does not list an f command at all.

The manpage in 3rd Edition explains f as ``the filename command''.

Assember and C sources of various editions all talk about filename
and none about facts.


Neither does ``facts'' seem to come from qed.

I couldn't find an f command there at all.

What's the background for the comment about ``facts''?
