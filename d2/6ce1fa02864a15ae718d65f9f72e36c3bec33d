All, we need help contacting some people so that Dan Doernberg can make
progress on a new Unix book that he's working on. I've attached his
request to the TUHS list below. If you can help out in any way, please
contact Dan directly.

Cheers, Warren

   Hello all, I’m the publisher of Lions' Commentary on UNIX (still
   going strong after 25 years!) and I have an “Ancient UNIX” book project
   in mind that I need some community help with.

   To avoid running into any “who has copyright rights to UNIX” legal
   problems, we’re trying to reach out in advance to any
   companies/organizations that may have such rights (Micro Focus, Xinuos,
   Nokia, are there others?) in advance. To that end, I’m trying to find
   staffers there who are:
      1. sympathetic to sharing information about “ancient UNIX” with the
   operating system/UNIX communities
      2. somewhat familiar with the past legal issues and controversies
   over UNIX ownership (perhaps someone in the legal department)

   If you know any such person(s) at Micro Focus, Xinuos, Nokia, and/or
   other relevant organizations that has either quality (or ideally a
   unicorn with both!), please pass on their name and email address to me
   (even better, add any context about why they might be helpful to me, if
   it’s OK to say that you referred me to them, etc.].

   Thanks much, all referrals greatly appreciated!
   Dan Doernberg
