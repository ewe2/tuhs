Hmm.. it's all about where you count.   Clearly, he was working on it if
the stubs is there.  If the only difference between 3rd and 4th is the pipe
code, then it would be fair to say that.

You might say something like:  Pipe's were developed in a 3rd edition
kernel, where there was is evidence of nascent idea (its has a name and
there are subs for it), but the code to fully support it is lacking in the
3rd release.  Pipes became a completed feature in the 4th edition.
