Yes. Indeed. It devolved to a copyright battle with the ultimate result
being a preliminary ruling that 32V (and V6 and V7 likely) had no copyright
protection because AT&T had distributed too many copies without the
required (at the time) copyright notices...  That preliminary ruling is
what forced the settlement of the suit, and is the reason that 4.4BSD-lite
had a bunch of files with AT&T copyrights on them with permission to
redistribute liberally...

These days, in open source cleanroom is rarely done except in extraordinary
cases. It's easier to read the code and reimplement because copyright
covers only the typing...
