This comes up every year, but could I ask that you please stop referring to
Robert T. Morris as an idiot? He acted foolishly and destructively, yes,
but he was quite young at the time and he paid for his mistake. He's gone
on to do very good work in systems and have a productive career; there
really is no need to continue to castigate him in this manner for a mistake
he made 31 years ago.
