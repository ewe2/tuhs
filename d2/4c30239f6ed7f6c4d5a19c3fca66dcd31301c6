Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

slide 4 --  All of HP-UX, Ultrix and Digital UNIX/Tru64 are BSD kernels.
HP-UP and Tru64 support System V calls.

BTW:  DG-UX and Stratus built their own kernels, but used System V command
systems and System Call definitions - which are not listed.

Slide 6 - if you want it I have another picture of the GE system from some
of their literature has a view of all of the components.   Send me email if
you want it.

Slide 8 - Sets out to write version of Fortran came up with B.  Uses B to
write Assembler

Slide 9 - Wrong DEC logo.  Should be the Blue one.  The maroon version does
not show up until the 1990s with Bob Palmer (and has bad memories for some
of us).

Slide 17 - Ken write PDP-11 assembler on PDP-7 in B. , Dennis starts to
rewrite B compiler to output PDP-11 code.

Slide 18 - B begins to become different enough that Dennis starts to call
it nb [new B], eventually deviates enough to become new language

Slide 19 - 4th Edition release outside of the BTL.  Lou Katz becomes 'user
zero'

Slide 20 -- We need to get you the site and group name from Mash.  It was
not in Summit, it was not USG - but was in NJ.  I thought it was Homdel but
I that is purely speculation.
                  Also the role of Columbus team needs to be defined.   Ask
Mary Ann.

Slide 21 -- I'm not going to argue - but I would ask you to add a
disclaimer.   This is what you could reconstruct, but there is some
question of some of the arrows.   Heinz might be able to help, but as
Stienhart and I have said, its believed to be in LA; but no one has tracked
him down as he has been pursuing non-computer interests.

Slide 22 --4th Edition went to Katz that this is wrong, who sometimes reads
this mailing list.  If not, send me a note, I'll reintroduce you.  He might
be able to give you a data.  Check with Warren, my >>memory<< is that some
of userland is still in C although a lot assembler is still there.

Slide 23 -- ??widespread??   -- I'm not sure I would use that. Not even 100
sites yet.     Also there were not "commercial version" this was the first
"commercial license" -- big difference [contact me if you want
explanation].  IIRC fee was 15K per CPU.  Commercial redistribution doesn't
occur until after 7th is released and was a separate license.   I would
add, Mike Lesk's portable C library is starting to be used, but most C
program do their own I/O with read/write

          First real install man page and Dennis build tape installation
system.   Earlier version released as RK05 disk copies.
           Also numerous new peripherals. IIRC Support for the 11/40 starts
here, 4th & 5th needed a 45 class, and earlier used the 20 with the CSS MMU.

Slide 24 -- CMU uses it to teaches OS class.  makes student in class sign a
sub-license.

Slide 25 - missing the first USENIX tapes. which include Harvard and the
like.  Warren and I can probably help a little here.

Slide 26 - new licenses.  Commercial license fees change to 20K for 1st
CPU/5K for each CPU afterward.  CMU buys first commercial license to use
UNIX to make money [after Cole and Klein go on strike].  Case Western
follows suit 6month later.   AT&T agrees for the Universities that they
only had to declare one CPU as commercial and could intermix otherwise and
notifies all the universities that if they were using it for commercial
purposes, then needed a license.

AT&T creates first redistribution license.  Needed at least one $20K
commercial CPU and then $150k for the rights to redistribute.   Originally
$1K per binary CPU.

Slide 27 -- missing Purdue Dual Vax and CMU Mach

Slide 28 - APS had NH which was the model the DEC plate you show.   Maddog
has it now on his Jeep when aps moved to CA (he also has the NH Linux plate
but I don't remember the car -- you can ask him).   I have had the
Massachusetts UNIX plate since 1983 (it's on my model S of course).   ghg
has indiana from around the same time (I think on a pickup).  wnj had the
CA vmunix on his Ferrari, but I don't know if he still has it or what its
on.

Slide 29 - Look in HenrySpencer-TUHS.org -- you'll find tail but not head.

Slide 31 - Job Control can from Europe via MIT.  Jim Kulp wrote it.   Noel
and I can give you the story if you want it.  It was on the PDP-11 there.
 Joy modified csh and added it to 4.1

Slide 32 -- JC was not from UCB.   Joy got it from MIT   -- Dennis create
ENV and it was first distributed in V7.

Slide 33 -- No Bourne supported ENV in the new shell -- see me earlier
email for how all this went down or ask Steve yourself.

Slide 34 -- PCC was included, but the Ritchie Compiler (a.k.a. Typesetter
C) was the default compiler.  You are missing a step BTW -- typesetter C
was released between V6 and V7.   As is the first draft of the White Book.
The new compiler had stdio but targets V6.
Also mpx was part of DataKit support.

Slide 35 --   Not sure that is true.   I thought Microsoft's Xenix ships
before Venix.    Particularly since you made the comment about System III
The original 8086 Xenix was a pure V7 port, with a few additions Gordon
brought with him from Purdue (i.e. ghg hacks).

Slide 52/53/54/55 -- wrong logo (see above)
