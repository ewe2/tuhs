Well, I stand behind my comments.  Take a look at what xfig(1) 
produces and contrast that with even an average pic(1) source
file.  You can't see what xfig is saying but you can easily see
what pic is saying.

Maybe people just haven't written much pic, but what you can do
with it, and see without rendering it, is pretty amazing.

I got James Clark to add the 'i'th concept so you could do for
loops to lay out elements and I wrote a pic script where you 
could set variables like cpus, networks, disks and it would
draw different configurations of a SPARCcluster.  

Pic is pretty neat, I find it easier to read than any of the
other troff preprocessors.
