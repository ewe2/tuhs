Subject: [Unix-jun72] Help needed with my mkfs.c
Message-ID: <20080504090203.GA32355@minnie.tuhs.org>

I've just checked in my latest tools/mkfs.c into the svn repository. Could
a few people eyeball it and look for errors. Even better, if you can eyeball
the working rf0.dsk image and compare it to an image made by my mkfs.c.

At present, I can make an rk0.dsk image with mkfs. I can run up a warm kernel
and try to mount the rk0 image as /usr, with my /tmp/a.out. But when I try
to chdir /usr, I get a Bad directory message.

So something is screwy with the rk0.dsk that my mkfs.c is making.

Thanks,
	Warren
