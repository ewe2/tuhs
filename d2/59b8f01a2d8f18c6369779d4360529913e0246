Hmm, that's actually not true.  He had a car accident in 1984 on his way to
the office which left him with brain damage.  He later died in 2008.

Dick Hustvedt, Peter Lipman and David Cutler were the principal engineers
responsible for VMS.  Lipman left DEC the same year (1984) and we all know
the later history of Cutler... ;)
