I guess I should have been clearer on what wouldn't work. It can't
possibly work for Japanese and Chinese where words aren't separated by
whitespace. Would cause problems in hybrid languages where words can
be composed of logograms and sonograms (say Japanese which often use a
few Kanji with hiragana endings that then run into hiragana particles
or other grammar elements). Can't work without modification (using
class names) for Cyrillic because there's no A or Z in words there.
Won't work in any language that has a discontiguous set of letters,
which includes many western european languages since all the accented
or otherwise decorated letters aren't in the range A-Z.

So whether or not the underlying tools can handle UTF-8 encoding,
there are problems with the original.

If you used:

 tr -cs "[:alpha:]" '\n' | tr "[:upper:]" "[:lower:]" | sort | uniq -c
| sort -rn | sed ${1}q

you'd still have issues with languages that don't use word separators,
or write non-alphabetically.
