Yes, but most, if not all of things were after I arrived, among the first
of a brace of fresh hot blood imported to grow 127. Things definitely felt
looser by the mid-80s.

Look, I'm not complaining. I absolutely loved working in the CS research
group. But culturally, at least upon my arrival, I felt like a fish out of
water.
