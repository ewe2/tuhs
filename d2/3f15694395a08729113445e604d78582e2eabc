At Solboure, we had /h/admin /o/os /o/home /x/build /x/home /x/prod etc.
The reason for this was the SunOS automounter and bugs it had that required
each machine to have a different top level directory. Luckily we only had
like 4 servers... This was to prevent hanging /h mounts when the /x machine
would go away and someone would do an ls in that directory. That bug got
fixed in the 4.0 -> 4.1 transition, but we none-the-less kept the structure
because it was too painful to transition...
