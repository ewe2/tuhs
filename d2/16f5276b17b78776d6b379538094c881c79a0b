I ran Taylor UUCP on a small BBS system (3 lines!) I ran from my 
apartment in Deer Park, NY, circa 1991-1994 - USENET node kilowatt

It was on System V R4 by Consensys on a 486-33 and later a 486DX2-66 - 
but some things were badly broken, so much so that things like UUCP 
weren't even usable. I don't remember why. Might have had something to 
do with the devices.

So Taylor it was. I have version 1.04 source code.

Hooked up to Motorola (mcdhup) in Hauppauge for USENET news and email, 
using a Telebit Worldblazer, and then disseminated it to various other 
small USENET nodes.

I had quite an interesting routing setup for the mail system included 
with SVR4 (mailsurr?) that would take the UUCP maps posted in 
comp.mail.maps, run them through pathalias and construct a complete path 
to every node in the map. It was the only way I knew of to deal with 
multiple systems I could connect to that would in turn also connect to 
multiple other USENET nodes. I had no definitive "smart host".
