GNU ed appears to be written entirely by one person (as in, no changelog
entries by anyone else since 1994), who perhaps not coincidentally is also
the author of the lzip compression program.  As you noted, ed source is
distributed only as lzip-compressed tarballs, so you have to be able to
compile and run lzip to compile and run ed.  lzip is written in C++, so to
have access to GNU ed you need a C++ compiler.  Which is very strange, as
GNU ed is a very simple C program, much as one would expect.

The configure program is extremely basic, which is great - why have more
than you need? - but when it detected that my $(CC) was not gcc, it
hard-coded $(CC) to cc and $(CFLAGS) to -O2, ignoring what I had passed to
the script.  A strange choice, but one that can easily be edited later in
the Makefile.  The basic C source compiled with no warnings whatsoever,
always a good sign.  At the linking stage I noticed that I needed a library
for some functions it wanted.  Okay, easy enough, just add a library to the
Makefile's LDFLAGS.  But the Makefile had this braindamage:

$(progname) : $(objs)
        $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $(objs)

so on any platform that needs libraries linked after objects, it will fail.

At that point, I gave up.  This is clearly one person's pet project and has
"but it works on my Linux box!" written all over it.  That, coupled with
the fact that the GNU folks are willing to endorse something that is solely
distributed in what can only be described as an extremely obscure
compression format, was just too much for me to handle.
