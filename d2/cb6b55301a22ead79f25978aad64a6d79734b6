I did the PDP-11 binutils stuff.  It was made just for fun, so it's
not very well tested, but most of the basic stuff should be quite ok.

As for GCC, I don't think the PDP-11 back end is in good shape.  I
haven't checked, but it could have been dropped from later releases,
because the last few years, the GCC team has been busy pruning their
source tree from old cruft.
