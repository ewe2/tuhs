Good idea.

Ted Bashkow. That's all I've found too. We should ask Dennis.

Berkeley Tague: I think one of the managers at Bell Labs. I should know
more, but a Google find this quickly:
http://www.ais.org/~jrh/acn/text/ACN6-1.txt, and there's more out there.

I've asked as many as I could find. An early AUUG or Usenix newsletter
mentioned that Jim McKie has won a 2nd Edition DECtape at a conference
"trivia night": I e-mailed him, and to cut a long story short, it is
probably the s1/s2 tapes that Dennis found. Kirk McKusick and Keith Bostic
found a DEC tape reader, connected it up to a VAX, and read the s1/s2 tapes
for Dennis.

Cheers,
