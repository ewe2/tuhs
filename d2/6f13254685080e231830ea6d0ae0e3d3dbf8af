this is bogus.

there are 2 real stories that might be
early cousins to this:

1. i visited eta (they were trying to make
a supercomputer - eta10 - that was supposed to
escape all the problems of software by porting
unix. i tested it and found a dozen bugs.

2. dmr and i visited nsa for some unrelated business
(see dmr, reed, morris paper on the enigma). mumahgh
was bragging about the super secure unix that ran
on a lot og their machines. he invited us to play and
gave us a console. dennis distracted him and i went
to the console and quickly became su. i never told
him how it was done, and now i dont really remember.
