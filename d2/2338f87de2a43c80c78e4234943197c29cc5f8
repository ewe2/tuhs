There's more in Stroustrup's paper for the second History of Programming
Languages conference, http://www.stroustrup.com/hopl2.pdf

See especially the prehistory section 2.1 on page 3 where he talks about
the painful tooling he was faced with in Cambridge, where Simula was nice
for program design but had a woefully slow implementation, whereas BCPL
was fast but grievously unsafe.

The quote above is repeated in the HOPL2 paper on page 12 in section 2.4.4
on "Why C?" and there's a bit more about comment syntax in section 3.3.1
on page 21.

Tony.
