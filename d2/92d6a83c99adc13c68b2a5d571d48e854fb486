Is there an emulator for the 132 column line printer anywhere?
I'd like to take a file (complete with FORTRAN carriage control) and turn it
into an image (PNG or whatever), supporting overstrikes.

On my bucket list is to convert my collection of image tapes from the 
1970s, intended to be printed on an lpr, cut into strips, and taped 
together, into images suitable for a laser printer or a normal monitor.

What font did a typical IBM mainframe printer use, anyway?
