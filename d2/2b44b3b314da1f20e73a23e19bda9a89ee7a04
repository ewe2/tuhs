Yea, that's what I thought. Either one could say that 2.9BSD was continued
to 2.10 and 2.11 by Seismo and related folks (which puts its release back
to 1983 or 1985 depending on how you count things) and also the NextStep /
OpenStep -> Rhapsody -> MacOS would count which puts it 1989 as the first
release. There was at least some level of discontinuity in each of the
transitions (BSD -> Seismo and NextStep -> MacOS) so I excluded them both...

In some ways there's a continuity between CSRG and FreeBSD (Kirk and
others) and NetBSD (others) as well, so how do you count that?  If you zoom
in too much, it becomes hard to make an unambiguous break because the code
pased from hand to hand so much with overlapping groups of people...
