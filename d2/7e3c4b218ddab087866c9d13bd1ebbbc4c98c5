Most of what was produced internally to AT&T had to stay there, because 
lawyers.

I was at Bell Labs by the time I changed termcap/termlib and the Arnold 
curses into "The New Curses and Terminfo", which I presented at Usenix 
in Boston 1982.  Terminfo was "compiled", and Curses had a new algorithm 
to use insert/delete line/char to avoid having to redraw the whole screen.

I wasn't allowed to distribute it outside AT&T. Pavel Curtis of CMU 
stepped up and, at my encouragement, volunteered to rewrite it to the 
same spec. I worked with him on the spec and the algorithm, and his 
version was available to open source.

If you were at the Boston conference, you may recall my presentation. My 
Director, Tony Cuilwik, was in the audience, and this was my first 
public talk since joining Bell Labs, so I was nervous. As I was stepping 
to the podium to begin my talk, Armando Stettner interrupted to present 
me with the "Flying Rubber Chicken Award". Someone offstage threw him a 
rubber chicken. The chicken was quickly vanished and replaced with the 
real award, "The Term Cap". Armando explained that the hat was an Bell 
System hard hat, donated by Ken Thompson himself. Scotched to the hat 
were "hacker eyes" (googly eye glasses) and a Steve Martin style 
arrow-through-the-head "for the term info to go in and come out". He 
left me there, holding the award, as I had to reboot my brain to begin 
my talk.

I still have that award. It graced my workplace for many years. When I 
worked at Bank One in Columbus, I put it on a styrofoam head on top of 
my cube. A coworker had contributed a yellow cheerleader pompom which 
gave her hair. When Chase bought Bank One, there were Chase big shots 
coming through our building, I was told to take it down because it 
didn't look "professional". I was offended - "that's an award!" It 
stayed down for several months, and people complained because, in that 
cube farm of identical rows of cubes, "people used that for navigation". 
I made a little plaque explaining the award and placed it next to the 
restored Term Cap on my cube. The award sat on my cube at SDG&E for 11 
years without incident, and now that I'm retired I proudly display it on 
my piano at home.
