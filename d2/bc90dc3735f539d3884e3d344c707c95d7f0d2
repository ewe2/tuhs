As with the resurgence of 33 1/3 records ("vinyl"), cassette tape may also 
become more prominent again:

I still use VCRs to record TV shows roughly once/week.

I have an interesting collection of audio recordings on 1/4" tape that I 
made 20-40+ years ago as an active sound technician/musician. I'd given up 
on my old reel to reel machines, but a year ago my birthday present to 
myself was a reel to reel machine and Dolby units. I'm very slowly fetching 
stuff out of my archives and digitizing.

I typically call it "recording" whether analog or digital...

P.S. Having started out with 80 column cards, 72 columns of content, 8 of 
sequencing, continuing through most of graduate school, I typically restrict 
myself to 72 columns when programming.
