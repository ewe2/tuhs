That is a cool link. At the bottom of the page are two images of floppy =
disks. These show an ISC copyright notice. Maybe this is because the =
floppies contained =E2=80=9Cextensions=E2=80=9D rather than Xenix =
itself.

=3D=3D=3D

Note that "IBM Xenix 1.0" is actually the same as MS Xenix 3.0, and =
arrived after MS Xenix had been available for 4 years (initially for the =
PDP-11 and shortly after for other CPU's):

"=46rom 1986 to 1989, I worked in the Xenix group at Microsoft. It was =
my first job out of school, and I was the most junior person on the =
team. I was hopelessly naive, inexperienced, generally clueless, and =
borderline incompetent, but my coworkers were kind, supportive and =
enormously forgiving =E2=80=93 just a lovely bunch of folks.

Microsoft decided to exit the Xenix business in 1989, but before the =
group was dispersed to the winds, we held a wake. Many of the old hands =
at MS had worked on Xenix at some point, so the party was filled with =
much of the senior development staff from across the company. There was =
cake, beer, and nostalgia; stories were told, most of which I can=E2=80=99=
t repeat. Some of the longer-serving folks dug through their files to =
find particularly amusing Xenix-related documents, and they were copied =
and distributed to the attendees.

If memory serves, it was a co-operative effort between a number of the =
senior developers to produce this timeline detailing all the major =
releases of Xenix.

I have no personal knowledge of the OEM relationships before 1986, and I =
do know that there were additional minor ports and OEMs that aren=E2=80=99=
t listed on the timeline (e.g. NS32016, IBM PS/2 MCA-bus, Onyx, =
Spectrix), but to the best of my understanding this hits the major =
points.

Since we=E2=80=99re on the topic, I should say that I=E2=80=99ve =
encountered a surprising amount of confusion about the history of Xenix. =
So, here are some things I know:

Xenix was a version of AT&T UNIX, ported and packaged by Microsoft. It =
was first offered for sale to the public in the August 25, 1980 issue of =
Computerworld.

It was originally priced between $2000 and $9000 per copy, depending on =
the number of users.

MS owned the Xenix trademark and had a master UNIX license with AT&T, =
which allowed them to sub-licence Xenix to other vendors.=20

Xenix was licensed by a variety of OEMs, and then either bundled with =
their hardware or sold as an optional extra. Ports were available for a =
variety of different architectures, including the Z-8000, Motorola =
68000, NS16032, and various Intel processors.

In 1983, IBM contracted with Microsoft to port Xenix to their =
forthcoming 80286-based machines (codenamed =E2=80=9CSalmon=E2=80=9D); =
the result was =E2=80=9CIBM Personal Computer XENIX=E2=80=9D for the =
PC/AT.
By this time, there was growing retail demand for Xenix on =
IBM-compatible personal computer hardware, but Microsoft made the =
strategic decision not to sell Xenix in the consumer market; instead, =
they entered into an agreement with a company called the Santa Cruz =
Operation to package, sell and support Xenix for those customers.

Even with outsourcing retail development to SCO, Microsoft was still =
putting significant effort into Xenix:=20

	=E2=80=A2 Ports to new architectures, the large majority of the =
core kernel and driver work, and extensive custom tool development were =
all done by Microsoft. By the time of the Intel releases, there was =
significant kernel divergence from the original AT&T code.

	=E2=80=A2 The main Microsoft development products (C compiler, =
assembler, linker, debugger) were included with the Intel-based releases =
of Xenix, and there were custom internally-developed toolchains for =
other architectures. Often, the latest version of the tools appeared on =
Xenix well before they were available on DOS.

	=E2=80=A2 The character-oriented versions of Microsoft Word and =
Multiplan were both ported to Xenix.

	=E2=80=A2 MS had a dedicated Xenix documentation team, which =
produced custom manuals and tutorials.

As late as the beginning of 1985, there was some debate inside of =
Microsoft whether Xenix should be the 16-bit =E2=80=9Csuccessor=E2=80=9D =
to DOS; for a variety of reasons =E2=80=93 mostly having to do with =
licensing, royalties, and ownership of the code, but also involving a =
certain amount of ego and politics =E2=80=93 MS and IBM decided to =
pursue OS/2 instead. That marked the end of any further Xenix investment =
at Microsoft, and the group was left to slowly atrophy.

The final Xenix work at Microsoft was an effort with AT&T to integrate =
Xenix support into the main System V.3 source code, producing what we =
unimaginatively called the =E2=80=9CMerged Product=E2=80=9D (noted by =
the official name of =E2=80=9CUNIX System V, r3.2=E2=80=9D in the =
timeline above).=20

Once that effort was completed, all Intel-based releases of UNIX from =
AT&T incorporated Xenix support; in return, Microsoft received royalties =
for every copy of Intel UNIX that AT&T subsequently licensed.=20

It will suffice, perhaps, to simply note that this was a good deal for =
Microsoft.=E2=80=9D


It would be so cool if these early (1980-1984) Xenix versions were =
available for historical examination and study.
