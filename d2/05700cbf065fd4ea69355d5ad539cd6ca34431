During the compile 'size' outputs a list of the sizes of the
overlays. Look at the output. For mine....

# size unix	! the OS kernel                                           
text    data    bss     dec     hex
55296   6492    20738   82526   1425e   total text: 106752
	overlays: 7744,7360,7872,7296,3072,7680,4864,5568
# size netnix	! the network code
text    data    bss     dec     hex
60864   2362    38448   101674  18d2a

The base must be less than 7 8k pages or 57344(decimal) bytes.
Each overlay must be less than 8k bytes or 8192(decimal).
The network code is not overlayed, so you have 8 pages or the
full 64k. 

> Is there a more scientific way to arrange the overlays?

To make it work, just get the sizes below the limits. The 
optimal arrangement would be placing the code in such that
the overlay changes were minimized. So... move your system
disk drivers into base and change the configuration to
remove any hardware you don't actually have.

No, it just requires some tweeking.....
