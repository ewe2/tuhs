Thank you, that Usenix paper is most helpful.

In short, there were (at least) 4 generations of PCC: PCC, PCC2, QCC and =
RCC. The first two by SCJ and the latter two by Kristol.
PCC2 seems to go back to about 1980, and QCC and RCC were created in the =
first half of 1985. The C compiler in 8th Edition seems to be PCC2 =
based.

For ease of reference I=E2=80=99ve put the M68K compiler that is =
included in the Blit source tree =
(https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dan_Cross_v8/) =
here:
https://gitlab.com/pnru/pcc2_m68k

Anybody who has some more info on how to read a =E2=80=9Cstin=E2=80=9D =
file, please share.

Paul

&gt;&gt; - The program that translates the =E2=80=9Cstin=E2=80=9D file =
to a =E2=80=9Ctable.c=E2=80=9D file is here: <a =

&gt;&gt; Sometimes one thing leads to another.<br class=3D"">
&gt;&gt; <br class=3D"">
&gt;&gt; Following the recent mention of some retro-brew 68K single =
board systems, I decided to build a CB030 board (in progress). I figure =
it is a rough proxy for a 1980 VAX and would allow for some =
experimentation with the 32V / SysIII / 8th edition code.<br class=3D"">
&gt;&gt; <br class=3D"">
&gt;&gt; My first thought was to use the M68K compiler that is included =
with the Blit sources (see THUS Archive for this), as I had used that =
before to explore some of the Blit source. That compiler is LP32, not =
ILP32 - which may be a source of trouble. Just changing the SZINT =
parameter yielded some issues, so I started looking at the PCC =
source.<br class=3D"">
&gt;&gt; <br class=3D"">
&gt;&gt; This source does not have a =E2=80=9Ctable.c=E2=80=9D in the =
well known format as described in the =E2=80=9CA tour of the portable C =
compiler=E2=80=9D paper. Instead it uses a file =E2=80=9Cstin=E2=80=9D =
which appears to be in a more compact format and is translated into a =
=E2=80=9Ctable.c=E2=80=9D file by a new pre-processor ("sty.y=E2=80=9D). =
Then looking at the VAX compilers for 8th and 10th edition, these too =
use this =E2=80=9Cstin=E2=80=9D file.<br class=3D"">
&gt;&gt; <br class=3D"">
&gt;&gt; All the other m68K compilers (based on pcc) that I found appear =
to derive from the V7/32V/SysIII lineage, not from the 8th edition =
lineage.<br class=3D"">
&gt;&gt; <br class=3D"">
&gt;&gt; A quick google did not yield much background or documentation =
on the STY format.<br class=3D"">
&gt;&gt; <br class=3D"">
&gt;&gt; Anybody on this list that can shed some light on the history of =
the STY table and on how to use it? Any surviving reports or memos that =
would be useful?<br class=3D"">
&gt;&gt; <br class=3D"">
&gt;&gt; Many thanks in advance<br class=3D"">
