Well, I think that is the general idea.

At least the lower case "unix".  Maybe not any specific "Unix".  Things do
grow / evolve / change over time.

I think many people working on Linux are genuinely trying to make it
better.  They just have no conceptual history to guide them.

What's the saying?  Those who do not understand history are doomed to
repeat it?  (For better or worse.)

Aye, and the script kitties seem to have won the war to commandeer the word
hacker.
