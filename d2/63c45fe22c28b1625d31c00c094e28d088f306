Subject: [TUHS] getting nroff to underline in v6,v5
Message-ID: <CADxT5N70c5pTHYgn2J7fN7FnrgXSeP=h=ep2g7X0bkwsoSKt1Q@mail.gmail.com>

It seems that nroff had the ability to show underlined text very early
on, possibly as early as v3 according to the v3 manual.

I haven't managed to get this to work right under simh but I was
thinking maybe there's a way to do it. It needs an 'underline font'
but the mechanism of how this worked in the old days is a bit of
mystery to me. The output device would have to have the ability to
either display or print underlined text. Maybe someone can remember
which terminal devices supported this in the old days which worked
"out of the box" in the v5,v6 era.

Maybe there was the ability to use overstrike characters on the teletype?

In bash I can use:

echo -e "\e[4munderline\e[0m"

Shouldn't be too hard to hack up something that works in emulated v5.
