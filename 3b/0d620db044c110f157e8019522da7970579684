It's not a matter of advantage so much as it's been a de-facto standard 
for so long and I'd just like to work with it even if it's just a clone 
like Lesstif.

Well, there is the Solaris stuff, and some of it's gone into Heirloom, 
which I believe is an attempt to bring together the existing open-sourced 
Unix code, and bring it up to date.  And I think Lesstif is a good enough 
clone of Motif for the majority of programs, in the way that Linux is of 
Unix, or am I wrong?
