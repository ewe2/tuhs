Seeing as we're talking about old Unix-y terminals, the ADM-3a was 
certainly one of my favourites; there was something about the keyboard 
layout that just screamed out "Unix".  Was it the unshifted "=" key?  The 
unshifted "[]" keys?  Can't remember now, but C programming was a breeze 
with it.

Another favourite was the Teleray 1061, with user-programmable function 
keys; yes, we were dumb enough to store our username/password there...

The *worst* terminal I've ever had to use was the VT-220 and its clones; I 
was always having to hunt'n'peck for common keys.  I still loathe it.
