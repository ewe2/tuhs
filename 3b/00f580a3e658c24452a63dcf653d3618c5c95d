I think the politically correct approach to this would clearly be:  
install a PDP-11 simulator on the host, and a suitable Unix on it, and  
unpack the archives with ar.

Actually, that's wrong: the politically correct thing to do would be  
to *buy a PDP-11*.  But that seems to be fairly hard nowadays.

The former approach might be fairly practical though.
