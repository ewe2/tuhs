So is "Office Open XML"; a sufficiently large campaign fund is 
indistinguishable from a standards committee.

Every Android device, iPhone/iPad, Chrome or Firefox installation, 
Windows 10 computer or Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation uses 
SQLite.  Also, the Library of Congress considers it as good as XML as a 
storage format.  It is fairly certain that SQLite is wider-adopted than
OpenDocument -- or at least wider-deployed.
          
I'd argue that SQLite files and XML documents both suffer from the same
problem, in that (during normal use) you have to load the whole thing in
order to use it effectively.  In other words, they don't play well with
pipes.
          
But for a document format, maybe the Unix Nature is less of a concern.
