But the GNU EMACS is not a RMS invention...

GNU EMACS is based on the Gosling EMACS and this did already include the LISP 
interpreter.

When Gosling started to work for Sun, he did no longer have the time to 
maintain it and did hand it over to Unipress. RMS did take this code, added a 
few small changed and sold it under the name GNU emacs.
