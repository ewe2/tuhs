Looks like you're right.  I found this in another file, so it would seem
he wrote it back at MIT:

  "The original YACC was designed and implemented on a PDP-11/45 and a
  Honeywell 6000 by S. C. Johnson at Bell Laboratories.  The version
  described in this paper was implemented on the PDP-10 by Alan Snyder.
