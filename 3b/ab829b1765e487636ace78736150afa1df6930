I'm pretty sure the two main System V based TCP/IP stacks were STREAMS
based: the Lachman one (which I ported to the ETA-10 and to SCO Unix)
and the Mentat one that was done for Sun.  The socket API was sort of
bolted on top of the STREAMS stuff, you could get to the STREAMS stuff
directly (I think, it's been a long time).

The STREAMS stuff never performed well and the BSD TCP stack or something
like it went into Solaris at some point.  That's another "I think".  If
you want the gory details I'll ask Neal Nuckolls, he would know, he was
in the networking group and worked closely with Mentat.
