Another Unix clone to find: http://i.imgur.com/dlGTh.png

Yourdon UNIX known as OMNIX for the Zilog Z-80
- compatible with CP/M
- ran on Industrial Microsystems and Cromemco CS-3
- had its own shell?
- multi-user and multi-process


I remain surprised/impressed that so many people from that era simply
decided to write their own Unix clone, no small undertaking at the
time.
