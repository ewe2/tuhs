A prototype was introduced in 3.0; it wasn't exactly usable until 3.1 
iirc.

I can confirm the presence of Interlnk in PC DOS 5.02 as well as MS-DOS 
6.00 (and this is why I specifically mentioned those versions).  I've done 
a lot of research on MS-DOS/PC DOS history. ;p

Interlnk does have a way, as I mentioned, to copy itself over a serial 
cable.  I suppose it probably relies on CTTY and DEBUG or something.
