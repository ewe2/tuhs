I tend to log in to forums these days as "luckydude" and that story is
just the first of many examples.  I have seemed to have gotten lucky
being building up the right experiences and then falling into a job that
can use them.  It really made me look better than I am, things just sort
of flowed.

And having almost 6 months to work on whatever I wanted and deciding to
port the networking stack?  Priceless down the road.  No way they would
have given me that task, I was too green.

Fun times.
