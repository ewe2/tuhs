One of the times I was lucky enough to be able to hire and set up what I tho=
ught would be the place I=E2=80=99d want to work (  design and code ), at th=
e beginning I did the best I could to solve the =E2=80=9Creligious=E2=80=9D c=
ode issues, tool issues, etc.=20

Code Formatting wise =E2=80=94 we came up with a =E2=80=9Cchecked-in-standar=
d=E2=80=9D.  All code went thru a code formatter when checking in.   When it=
 came out, we build a couple templates that translated to formats for things=
 that different folks wanted ( and gave folks the option of tweaking their o=
wn ).  They could use the default ( I did ).   Any thing was fair game, as l=
ong as it got checked in =E2=80=9Cin the checked in standard=E2=80=9D.   We a=
lso came up with a set of rules for complexity, nesting.   The entire team a=
ctually was able to come to agreement =E2=80=94 if your code didn=E2=80=99t v=
iolated the limit of minor or misc things ( critical and major things had to=
 be addressed ) it was fine. We set a limit of 1000 for minor and I think 50=
00 for misc.    I was surprised how far from the standard stuff looked on va=
rious folks workstations but during code reviews we had a =E2=80=9Ccommon la=
nguage format=E2=80=9D we all could read without much fuss.=20

We did go with a line length of <132 so if necessary we could print stuff ou=
t landscape.

Tool wise, if it got in the way more than 50% it was gone and we=E2=80=99d f=
ind a new one.   Preference was for every editor, etc. to have at least two u=
sers on the team. ( so you=E2=80=99d have someone to ask questions of ) And y=
ou could use an IDE as long as code had standard makefiles when checked in. =
=20

Surprisingly this worked out quite well with a team of around 20...
