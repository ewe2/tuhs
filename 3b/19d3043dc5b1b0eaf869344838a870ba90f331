So back in the BitKeeper days, we supported everything, including AIX.  I've
got a fairly beefy AIX box in my shop in case we need it, 1ghz, lots of ram,
we're never gonna turn that on.  I went into smit and I was just like can 
you just frigging let me edit /etc/inetd.conf or whatever, but no.

SMIT happens.  And I did not like it.  I think that's one of the reasons
that SunOS was cool, it was just a better, bugfixed BSD.  So we all knew
how to deal with it.  SMIT not so much.
