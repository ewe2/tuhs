Indeed - that's how UCB Systems worked.  /tmp was a small scratch disk and
anything there was suspect.  Scratch files were not a CShell feature, they
were a UNIX feature, very much needed on the 16-bit address PDP-11 where it
was developed.

   The idea originally became popular with Dennis's C Compiler which used
it for the intermediate files between the passes on the PDP-11.   On a
large public system like a University, /tmp would fill with cruft.   It was
traditionally removed on reboot.  But that was not good enough for
production systems that did not reboot.

    My memory is that there was a script that was similar to what Aharon
suggested that ran in the early hours of the day, although before it ran it
created a time_stamp_file with touch(1) set to be 6 hours previous so the
script let anything under 6 hours survive using a negation on the -newer
time_stamp_file clause.

 it sounds<br>
