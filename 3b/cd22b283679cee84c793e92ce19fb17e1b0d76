I'd feel a *lot* happier if we'd finally get confirmation from SCO
that they both know about this license and agree that it's genuine.  I
was contacted by a reporter a week or so ago, and I told her about it.
She contacted Caldera, who pointed to
http://shop.caldera.com/caldera/ancient.html as the current valid
license agreement:

It appears that there has been such turnover in Caldera/SCO in the
last 15 months that they don't know what they have done.
