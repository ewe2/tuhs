Sure, it was a long time ago, but I’ll tell you what I remember.   The one thing I do remember is that the SV /bin/sh was
written in these horrendous macros that sort of made it look like algol or something.   When the SVR2 shell came out,
someone (not Bourne obviously) had undone all those in favor of the native C++ if/else/while blocking.

Command line editing might have been implemented in the driver as enhanced editing in “cooked” mode, but the history
is a bit more context specific.
