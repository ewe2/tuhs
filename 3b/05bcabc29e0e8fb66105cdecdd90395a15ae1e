This is true, but in some sense has always been true, in that the
number of embedded devices using microcontrollers and so forth has
always dwarfed the number of desktop PC-class computers in the world
(or, rather, has always done so for since the late 70s or so, I'd
imagine).

However, to call Windows a minor player is to ignore the importance of
the applications that run on those desktop machines (and laptops,
etc). The PC might be on the decline in absolute market terms, but it
seems obvious that for specialist applications we're going to need
something resembling it for the foreseeable future.

> I=E2=80=99ve no idea how big the fleet of servers powering =E2=80=9CThe C=
loud=E2=80=9D in Datacentres is, but inferring from power consumption, it=
=E2=80=99s measured in millions.

Aggregated across all the major players, I'd put the number at tens of
millions, possibly in excess of 100 million at the high end of the
estimate range.

rvisor, not bare metal. Is MS Hyper-V derived from a Unix variant? If not, =
is certainly influenced by VMware & Xen which were.

First, a factual correction: at least Google's cloud and I'm fairly
certain AWS can run Windows, not just Azure.

Second, I have it directly from folks who worked on Hyper-V that it is
neither based on Unix/Linux, nor strongly influenced by either VMWare
or Xen. It was an entirely in-house project at MSFT that probably
includes more DNA strands from Windows than Unix et al. Some of the
stories about clashes with Cutler to change the Windows startup
sequence to accommodate Hyper-V are interesting (short version:
Cutler, in typical fashion, didn't want to and early versions of
Hyper-V basically booted under windows, then "took over" the running
machine so that Windows resumed, but suddenly in a VM where it had not
been before).

The above notwithstanding, I absolutely believe these numbers. Unix
and its derivatives (most notably Linux) have become the de-facto
platform for modern computation, as you conclude.
