Doh! Thanks for the correction. Finger fart.

Ah. Yes, that could definitely be a problem.

Hum. That seems like it would be more of an implementation issue. Why 
wouldn't you just cache all the entries for the terminal once and for 
all? terminfo never came to 16-bit systems anyway, so we're talking 
about systems with plenty of memory. Caching the terminal information 
would not be a big memory cost.

Thanks for the insight.
