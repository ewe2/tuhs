Yeah, there are a large number of distros but I'm willing to bet that
Debian, RedHat and Ubuntu variants account for the vast majority of
installs.

Try installing an OpenBSD kernel on FreeBSD, that's what we mean by
compat.  I'm more than willing to believe that you can pull head on
the FreeBSD source tree and build & install it on FreeBSD.  Much less
willing to believe that that works Open/Free or Net/Free.

With Linux, on pretty much any distro, you can pull Linus' tree and
build and install it without drama.  If you are running some ancient
release you might have to update your toolchain but that's about it.
Linus is super careful to not break the syscall table.  It's extend
only, which makes it a mess, but a binary compat mess.

Yes, you are correct, I've experienced that as well with sort of
newer complex apps.
