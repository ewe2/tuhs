As I recall qmail came before djbdns.  I started using qmail in the 90s in
its pre 1.0 version because I wanted a SMTP MTA didn't want to use sendmail,
and had wasted too much time trying to get my head around MMDF.

qmail had the advantage of being small, simple, with easily understood
distinct parts,  and one could easily extend it - sort of in the tools
approach, by plugging bits in to its dataflow pipeline.

The code was a bit 'interesting', but not too awkward.
