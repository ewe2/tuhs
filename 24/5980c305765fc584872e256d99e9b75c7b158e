Netflix has how many machines? I'd say in general that principle
holds: this is the age of huge distributed computation systems, the
most you can pay for a single core before it tops out is in the
hundreds of dollars, not in the millions like it used to be. The high
end isn't very high up, and we scale by adding boxes and cores, not
by getting single CPUs that are unusually fast.

Taking the other way of looking at it, from what I understand,
CDN boxes are about I/O and not CPU, though I could be wrong. I can
ask some of the Netflix people, a former report of mine is one of the
people behind their front end cache boxes and we keep in touch.
