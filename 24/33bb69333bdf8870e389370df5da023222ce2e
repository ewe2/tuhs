C.MMP was 12 11/40's and 4 11/20's.  Each processor had 4KW of local
memory + the 4KW I/O page.  The rest of the memory (1.2MW) was
accessible through a "cross-point" switch (ie it wasn't a common memory
bus...think of it as 16 port memory -- there was no memory contention
unless 2 processors wanted to access the same page (4KW) of memory).

In addition to the cross-point switch there was special IPC
(Inter-Processor Communication) hardware to allow the processors to
interrupt and communicate with each other.

The O/S that was run was Hydra a very radical capability based system
(ie everything was represented as a capability -- files, programs, I/O,
etc).  If you didn't have a capability for something you didn't even
know it existed.  It was very cool!

Somewhere I still have my "Hydra Songbook" which contains a bunch of
details + kernel calls about Hydra.

There was a predecessor (prototype) that supported either 2 or 4
11/40s.  I remember seeing it in the same machine room as C. but don't
remember what it being used for at the time as it was "discarded" from
the C. project.
