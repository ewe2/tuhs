I read books and code by look at the middle of the page or the middle of
the terminal and scrolling my eyes downward.  I don't look side to side.
I literally read the middle of the text and I get the rest through
peripheral vision.

This is what Warner (I think) was saying about books.  If you make them
too wide you have to move your eyes back and forth and that is both
slower and more tiring.

80-100 columns is fine, 132 is too wide, that forces people to move
their head/eyes back and forth.
