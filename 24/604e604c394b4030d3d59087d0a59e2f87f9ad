On the CDC 3800, the top three bits of the accumulator were scaled and =
summed by a set of three resistors, then fed into the console speaker.  =
Generally, this produced noise of very little interest (except to =
indicate that the machine was running).

However, when I ran my Shellsort =
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort =
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort>), the speaker made a very =
distinctive sound.  It was a series of rising tones whose durations got =
shorter and shorter.   Something like Vwooooooooooop, Vwooooooop, =
Vwooooop, Vroop, ...
