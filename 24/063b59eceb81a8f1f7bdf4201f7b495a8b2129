nmake ??  I think it may have been called.  I touched something that
matches what is being called "exptools" and the like when I was at 6200
Broad St.  We used nmake and ksh extensively in the software project I
was a part of, and I know I had access to the source for an ancient
version of nmake at one point.  And I remember the subscription thing
too and I seem to recall you had to pay per architecture at least by the
time I was exposed to it.  I got the ancient nmake version compiled on
HP-UX 10.x to get part of the product I was a part of building on HP-UX
10.x.  The official HP-UX 10.x version from the subscription service was
expensive, as I remember things.

There was at least one person in the group who used a version of emacs
that was from the same, or related, source.  I never used it, as I
preferred GNU emacs.
