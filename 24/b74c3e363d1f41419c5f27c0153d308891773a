Subject: More USENIX tapes recovered
Message-ID: <000111165814.202000b0@trailing-edge.com>

On a recent expedition, I recovered some additional USENIX tapes:

  Usenix 83
  Usenix 87
  Usenix 88
  Usenix 89

Now, none of these are as "classic" as the current Usenix tapes in the
PUPS archive (by my searching, Usenix 77, 78, 79, 80, and 81.)  Is
there perhaps some other on-line archive out there that would be
interested in copies of these tapes?  My E-mails to various addresses
on www.usenix.org so far have left me with the impression that they
have no library of material older than 1993 and they have no interest
in older material, though I strongly suspect that I'm talking with all
the wrong people.

Kind greetings, all. I am a new member of the Society, and have been
delighted with the messages I have seen.

Recently I came into posession of a MicroVAX 4000 series machine at an
auction, and the question now is: What do I do with the darned thing? It was
really a bargain I could not pass up; and I'm pretty sure that it is in
entirely usable condition. (I still have to fully test it.)

Suggesetions? I have no Web site to run, even if I did want to spend the
money on the required infrastructure & maintenance.

Much obliged in advance, and again, I am more than happy to have joined the
Society.

The right answer for you is the Quasijarus project. See its WWW page at:

http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/Quasijarus/

The project has a mailing list to which I have already subscribed you. To post
to the list, send to quasijarus at meson.jpsystems.com. If anyone else wants to
subscribe, drop a line to quasijarus-request at meson.jpsystems.com.

Argh! Used the wrong sig file again! Here is the right one:

I guess I'll keep bumping into this one until I set up separate mail addresses
for my two affiliations and subscribe to all lists from the right one... Sorry
about that.
