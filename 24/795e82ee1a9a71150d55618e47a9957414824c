The n rule is actually what lead me to studying nl.  It's also supported in=
 System III but not V7, although ed's n does show up in V8-V10.  The implem=
entation looks similar although integrated slightly differently.  Probably =
from the same source though.

There's also an implementation in 4.4BSD-Lite, although plan old 4.4 with t=
he AT&T encumbered ed doesn't implement n.

So a rough timeline I can see for line number filters based on source code,=
 old docs, etc:

1977 - num and ex's '#' commands are introduced for 2BSD release
1980 - nl and ed's 'n' commands are introduced in System III
1980 - num's trail goes dark between 4 and 4.1c BSD
1982 - System V adopts ex, including '#'
1985 - Research has adopted ed with n by now as well as ex, never adopts nl
1992 - POSIX.2 is released, codifying nl, ed with n, and ex with #
1992 - nl appears in GNU fileutils
1994 - 4.4BSD-Lite ed includes n
1999 - NetBSD 1.4 adds nl
2002 - FreeBSD 4.5 adds nl
2005 - MacOSX 10.4 with text_cmds-47 adds nl
2013 - MINIX 3.2.1 adopts NetBSD nl
2014 - OpenBSD 5.5 adds nl

So all in all, num was an attempt that petered out, but # stayed in ex.  Sy=
stem III and 4.4BSD-Lite ed derivatives implement n, and nl was introduced =
in System III for the AT&T line and slowly cropped up elsewhere.  System V =
picked up ex in 1982, allowing nl, ed with n, and ex with # in the AT&T lin=
e.  GNU had one out of the gate when POSIX hit.  BSDs were late to the part=
y with regards to both ed with n as well as nl, with nl only being adopted =
after the last Berkeley releases and subsequent fracturing.

So thus far it seems the earliest line numberer to see wide use was probabl=
y ex's #.  System III's nl became the ubiquitous tool for the job and was t=
hen slowly adopted elsewhere.  Ed rides a fine middle ground with the n com=
mand that saw wider adoption earlier.  I still have to wonder if there was =
something earlier though.
