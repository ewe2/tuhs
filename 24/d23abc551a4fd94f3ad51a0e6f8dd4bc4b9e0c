shar, by the way, stands for "shell archive."  That is, it's an archive
that could be unpacked by feeding the file into sh.
The most complete unshar is probably at
http://sources.vsta.org/comp.sources.unix/volume15/cshar/  It's portable C
(for its time, 20 years ago). Safety, in terms of not trashing an existing
file, was a goal.
