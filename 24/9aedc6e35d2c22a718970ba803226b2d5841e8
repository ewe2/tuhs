Thanks for the feedback, all good points.  I don't know how much time 
I have, it will depend on who is at the service.  So I'm inclined to
do the music one and the log one and then let someone else talk.
If there seems like there is too much dead time then I'll get up
again and fill in the other ones.

The music pics are here:

I printed

and

as well as the log pics.  I cropped the one of him smiling, it's perfect.

Thanks for your feedback.
