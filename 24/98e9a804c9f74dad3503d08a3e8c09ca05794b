It's not dead, it's just pining :)

I think organizations with a clue buy the biggest boxes they can and allow
multi user access for devs.

But with disk so bloody cheap and VMs working so bloody well, it's pretty
easy to spin up a VM and give it to some idiot who thinks they need root.

You know what it reminds me of?  Eunice on a VAX running VMS.  It seems like
Unix but you're the only one there.  Sort of lonely.  I liked running who
and seeing a bunch of people logged in.  Run finger $boss and see if he 
read your email.
