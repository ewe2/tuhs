Subject: [TUHS] Unix Archive: how to upload
Message-ID: <20170218000531.GA17910@minnie.tuhs.org>

Hi all, to quickly answer one recent question. If you want to upload
something Unix-related for me to archive, you can anonymous ftp upload to
ftp://minnie.tuhs.org/incoming/

Nobody can list the directory contents, so it's good for sensitive files.
If you upload something called xyz, can you also add xyz_Readme which might
describe e.g. what the thing is, where it came from, file format (e.g.
floppy images), how to install it, any other useful information.

If you think it can be added to the public Unix Archive at
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/, or if the file definitely can't be added
and I should move it to the hidden archive, also say so. Also feel free
not to disclose your identity.

Cheers, Warren

P.S Work has become busy this year. I might call for people to help
out with the curation. Any volunteers? Discretion is a pre-requisite.
