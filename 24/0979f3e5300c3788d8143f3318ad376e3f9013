Yes:

  http://www.ivorcatt.com/47c.htm

(It's also available behind the IEEE pay-wall.) That issue of the Annals (5/3)
has a couple of articles about Colossus; the Coombs one on the design is
available here:

  http://www.ivorcatt.com/47d.htm

but doesn't have much on the reliability issues; the Chandler one on
maintenance has more, but alas is only available behind the paywall:

  https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/an/1983/03/man1983030260-abs.html

Brian Randell did a couple of Colossus articles (in "History of Computing in
the 20th Century" and "Origin of Digital Computers") for which he interviewed
Flowers and others, there may be details there too.
