Sendmail.

Since I got a business-class fiber connection from Verizon FIOS last 
year, I've been tempted to really "roll my own" receiving mail server, 
but haven't because of the SPAM issue.

Most of my main inbound email goes through Godaddy because I have an 
umlimited (almost) hosting account with them. They filter 99% of the 
SPAM and I'm happy with that. Let them deal with the updates and such.

I use fetchmail to pull down email from various other places - gmail 
(I'm a subcontractor to someone), Godaddy, outlook.com, etc.

Outbound I push it through Godaddy again. Verizon recently cut their 
mail service outbound for email outside of their root domain. Can't 
blame them, they were probably being used to spam by customers' machines 
that had been compromised.
