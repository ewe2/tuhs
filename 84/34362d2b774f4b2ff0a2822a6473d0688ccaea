There was a site I encountered in 2007-2008 collecting old Linux distros, but I haven't been back since 
then. I've forgotten its name, but I think that could be remedied easily enough. I've also got some 1994-
6 Linux CDs - FWLIW, I put an SLS distro on the Bochs site in 2002-3: I don't know what's happened 
since then.
