For what you're doing, I think you'll want to add -nostdinc, and 
-nodefaultlibs to your gcc command line.  The -nostdinc option stops the 
compiler from looking at the standard include path files, and the 
-nodefaultlibs option causes the compiler to not use any of the gcc 
libraries while still using the standard startup file.  You'll have to 
supply the paths to the headers and libraries yourself.

In case I'm wrong, and you need to supply your own startup code as well, 
change the -nodefaultlibs option to -nostdlib.  That drops all standard 
startup code and libraries from the build.  It's the set of options I'm 
using in the current kernel build (to be released next week some time).

According to the gcc docs, the compiler may generate calls to memcmp, 
memset, and memcpy.  That means they'll be the first calls you'll have 
to implement in your libraries.
