I have no idea whether Microsoft based SFU on OpenBSD or not, but
the conventional wisdom on Groklaw, the SCOX Yahoo Finance Board,
and similar domains that are following the SCO issue is that Microsoft's
purchase of the license was a backdoor way of financing an attack on
Linux.  I don't whether that's true either, but it does provide an
answer to your question.
