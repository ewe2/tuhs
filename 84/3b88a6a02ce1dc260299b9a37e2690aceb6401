While I agree with the other excellent comments in this thread (I just 
dig out my document for the original "Portable C Library (on UNIX)", 
complete with functions beginning with "C"), I have one small correction.

Variable length file names in directories actually didn't come out until 
the Berkeley Fast Filesystem in 4BSD.  They were not in V7 or even 3BSD.

> By the time Version 7 rolled around, the variable length directories had also appeared in the filesystem.    I suspect strcpy arrived with the "portable I/O library", an abomination that eventually evolved into the stdio library and to this day is still stinking up the standard C language.
