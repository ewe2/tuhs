Yes, there is no change to the license - all that happened is that
the web pages finally got moved across to the caldera.com domain.

I agree that the current license is *way* too complex - it's still
effectively just a cut down version of an old AT&T / SCO source
license - I would love to just get all of it "open-sourced" and
made completely freely available (might still have to be restricted
to non-commercial use, though).

I'll see if I can make any progress on this, but unfortunately it
isn't going to be very high on anyone's priority list right now.
