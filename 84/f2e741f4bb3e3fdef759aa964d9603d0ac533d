Well, this happened in Summer and at that time, I was wondering whether I 
should send a note to this list.

He had a heart attack in spring and returned to the weekly POSIX 
teleconferences after aprox. 6 weeks. After another 6 weeks where he attended 
the teleconferences again, we received the message that he passed away...


BTW: Roger died a few days before this thread started:

The Linux people did not seem to know where /proc is from...
