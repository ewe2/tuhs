The web page mentions files-11 which is ODS-1.

I also found an ODS-2/ODS-5 driver for Linux at
<http://www.vms2linux.de/ods5fs.html>.  Whether it would handle ODS-1,
I don't know.

In any case, it would be worth transferring these two images to bitsavers
so that they can be found by people who want RSX-11M volumes.

It's the old, old story.  Droid meets droid.  Droid becomes chameleon.
Droid loses chameleon, chameleon becomes blob, droid gets blob back
again.  It's a classic tale.  --Kryten, Red Dwarf
