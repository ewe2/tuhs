Subject: [TUHS] Temporary loss of minnie.tuhs.org
Message-ID: <200305270054.h4R0sIQG061814@minnie.tuhs.org>

All,
	At 7am on Saturday 31st May (local time), the machine which runs
this mailing list will be temporarily shut down as major power and UPS
alterations are done in the machine room. I am informed that this should
only take 12 hours, but you know what computers and such are like.
Therefore, you should expect that this mailing list will be unavailable
over the weekend of the 31st May / 1st June.

Normal services will be resumed shortly :-)

Cheers,
	Warren
