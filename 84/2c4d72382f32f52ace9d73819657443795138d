A 3rd Edition kernel (ok, nearly 4th Edition) still survives at:
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/research/Dennis_v3/

We don't have any 3rd Edition application. However, the kernel can be
tweaked to understand the 5th Edition filesystem layout, and we have
been able to boot this kernel and run some 5th Edition programs on it.
Of course, the pipe system call is missing :-)
