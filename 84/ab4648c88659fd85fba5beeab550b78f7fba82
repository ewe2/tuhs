What for ?
Vim 6.1(my port) under Coherent works perfectly. And of course Coherent
has its own very good vi and also ed and microEmacs and as far as I
rememeber (I have seen on Tuhs) Emacs too.
I have ported also mp( ala DOS edit) , asedit,xed(better version of
xedit) .Unfortunately I was not lucky with gvim and nedit.I have added
also about 1990 my own editor cedit(with hex support ala vim), but it
was for Coherent 4.0 and I did not port it to Coherent 4.2.10 yet.

OK, but if You see it does make sense than do it.
