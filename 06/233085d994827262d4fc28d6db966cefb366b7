I haven't had a job that didn't provide a Linux workstation since the
early 2000s.  Linux has made it to the desktop already, regardless of what
goes on in discount electronics stores.  It's not particularly good at
the desktop, but then, it's not particularly good at anything else,
either.  Like any other operating system, you get out what you put in.

Happy new year.
