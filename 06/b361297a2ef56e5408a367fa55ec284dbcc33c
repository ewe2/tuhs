My apologies, I am sometimes not as careful with documentation as I should
be.  I'm not up for transcribing every last command, but I can walk you
through the basic idea.  This assumes that you have extracted the necessary
files from http://www.stargatemuseum.org/maps/032383.GRF.txt , which you
have to do by hand because this is before shar.

This was all done in SIMH, using a simulated PDP-11/70 running Ultrix 3.1,
but I believe that what I did would work just as well on 2.xBSD.  The 1981
Usenix tape (
https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Applications/Shoppa_Tapes/usenix_81.tar.gz )
was attached to a virtual TK-50 drive (SIMH can now attach .tar files
directly, with no conversion!) and extracted.  The "ucol" directory
contains the sources for leroy.  The first step is to rebuild the plot
library in leroy/plotsrc. Remove plib and *.o and run make, then back to
the leroy directory, clean and make.  The makefile installs /bin/leroy for
you after building.  Run "/bin/leroy < map.leroy" and it gives you
leroy.out, which is in the special extended plot format that UCol
developed.  You need to convert this to Tek 4014, and there is a program
for doing that in ucol/plot.  But first you have to build the modified
libt4014, which is in ucol/libplot.  "make lilbt4014.a" will get you what
you need there.  Back to ucol/plot, edit the makefile to use your newly
built libt4014 instead of the system's, clean out everything there and
build tek.  But wait!  You still need the Hershey fonts in the right place,
so move the contents of ucol/vroff to be /usr/src/cmd/vroff (or you could
modify the source to put it wherever you want, I guess).  Then finally you
can pipe leroy.out through tek to get a 4014 file, which will be readable
by a modern tek2plot.
