Long ago, I could swear I'd read a paper (or a TM, or something) that
described the process of a Unix system booting.  It presented a timeline
describing the sequence of how the boot blocks are loaded, the kernel
is loaded, MMU turned on, etc.

However, other than that, I can't recall a thing about it - can't remember
the title, the author, or where I found it.  I don't remember if it talked
about this process on a Bell Labs Unix system, or a BSD system (though it
had to be one of those - either 7th Edition or BSD).  The timeframe was
probably mid to late 1980's, though I could be wrong about that.

Does this ring a bell with anyone?  I really wish I could find it again...
