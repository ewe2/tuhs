I'm not clear on what you mean by this.  Here is how I was planning to do
the install:

 1) Boot from tape
 2) Install miniroot on disk
 3) Boot from disk
 4) Untar rest of installation onto disk from tar tape file

The instructions in usr/src/man/docs/setup (in the tar file) talk about
using cpio and cpio format tape files instead of tar, but all I have is a
tar file.

I have not managed to finish step 3.
