Technically, the DEC DECwriter series were dot-matrix printers, not line =
printers. They differed from their Teletype predecessors only in print-head =
technology, but both printed a single character at a time. Daisywheel printers =
were similar.

Line printers are distinguished not by the width of the paper but by the =
printer having enough print heads to print an entire line of output at a time. =
That speed advantage made them the preferred output device for many-page =
program listings, as opposed to a teleprinter terminals which were more =
suitable for interactive computing.

There were dot-matrix line printers of the late 1970s made by Printronix, =
which is apparently still around.
