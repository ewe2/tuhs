Early realtime variants of Unix.  I don't think it's correct to state
that MERT "never made it outside the Labs" -- wasn't dMERT ("duplex 
MERT") the original operating system for the multiprocessor 3B20 in
the #4 and #5ESS telephone switches?  Indeed, vestiges of this use
have crept into more modern AT&T Unix releases; for instance, there
are references to MERT system call and signal numbers in various SVR4
header files.

   But as he knew no bad language, he had called him all the names of common
 objects that he could think of, and had screamed: "You lamp!  You towel!  You
 plate!" and so on.              --Sigmund Freud
