I cannot reproduce the behavior you describe, sorry. I'm using
32-bit Ubuntu, and compiled SIMH 3.9-0 freshly out-of-the-box.
Everything comes up as it should, including UNIX V7 multi-user
mode.

Did you remember to
  -  substitute 'tm' for the tape in all commands
  -  substitute 'hp' for the disk in all commands
  -  use hptmunix when booting
  -  do a 'mv hptmunix unix' in preparing further bootstraps
  -  'make rp04' and 'make tm' in /dev for creating devices
  -  use 153406 as size for the filesystem on /dev/rp3
  -  copy /usr/mdec/hpuboot as boot block?
Each of these steps is absolutely necessary to successfully
boot the system.

Good luck!

Hellwig
