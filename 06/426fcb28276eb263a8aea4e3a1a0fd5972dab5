Ah. You and Ron are right. I am confused.

So there were some previous PDP-11 models who did not have their memory 
on the Unibus. The 11/45,50,55 accessed memory from the CPU not through 
the Unibus, but through the fastbus, which was a pure memory bus, as far 
as I understand. You (obviously) could also have memory on the Unibus, 
but that would be slower then.

Ah, and there is a jumper to tell which addresses are served by the 
fastbus, and the rest then go to the Unibus. Thanks, I had missed these 
details before. (To be honest, I have never actually worked on any of 
those machines.)
