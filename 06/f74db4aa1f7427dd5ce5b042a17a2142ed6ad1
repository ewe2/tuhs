IMO, only one choice: Chuck Guzis (cclist@sydex.com); he's very active in the
vintage computer community, and reads old media professionally.

I've used him (to recover those backup tapes of the MIT PWB1 system), which
was rather tricky (bad mold; he had to build a special tool to remove it), and
I was incredibly happy. Very reasonable price too - although he may have given
me a special 'collector' rate.. :-)
