Sorry, I was less than clear.  I was just doing a thought
experiment about an alternate declaration syntax.  Requoting
from my email:

                             But if you put the var all the way
  to the right and read a declaration right to left, it works:

Basically suggesting that if all type machinery *preceded* an
object declaration (including for functions), we don't need any
parentheses and declarations are very easy to understand --
you just read a declaration from right to left. So no need
for cdel!  Too late for this, of course!
