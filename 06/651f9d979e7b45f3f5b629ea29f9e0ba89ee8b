Ahhh; that brings back fond memories of my Cyber-72 days, and how easily 
we CompSci kiddies broke into KRONOS...[*]

One of my favourite machines was the PDP-8; the JSR instruction planted 
the return address in the first word and jumped to the second word, with a 
return being done (IIRC) by an indirect jump to the first word. 
Recursion?  What's that?

Can't remember it now, but (on an LA-36 Duckwriter) it was something like:

     COMMON POOL
     RELEASE POOL
     (intr)

     (Could be abbreviated to "COMMO POO" and "REL POO" for those with a
     sick sense of humour, which was most of us.)

and you got system privileges...
