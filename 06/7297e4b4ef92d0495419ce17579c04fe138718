You're on one... TUHS... its a great Unix mailing list ;)

Though, for your question, your best bet would be to get a good
newsreader and peruse comp.os.unix.admin or similar.

Also, ugu is a good resource to have handy (www.ugu.com).

Though, it is also worth giving more details on the system you use --
i.e. system name, release version, X version etc etc.
