Subject: [pups] ultrix-3.x install using simh?
Message-ID: <200403150025.i2F0PpJ22311@mwave.heeltoe.com>


Hi,

Has anyone tried to install the ultrix-3.x distribution using simh?

I hacked a little program to build a tape image.  It boots fine.  I told
the ultrix install I wanted to install for an 11/34 on a RL02.  It seems
to install fine and then reboot on the RL02 but hang in the shell after
the boot (see below).

I know using an RL02 with an 34 is optimistic :-) it's just that what I
have for actual hardware.

any idea if this is an simh problem or an ultrix problem or user error?
