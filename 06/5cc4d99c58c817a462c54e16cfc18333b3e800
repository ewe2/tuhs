The 'second' C compiler was a PDP-10 and Honeywell (36-bit) target Alan
Synder did for his MIT Thesis.
It was originally targeted to ITS for the PDP-10, but it ran on Tops-20
also.

My >>memory<< is he used a 7-bit Character, ala SAIL, with 5 chars stored
in a word with a bit leftover.

You can check it out:  https://github.com/PDP-10/Snyder-C-compiler

I believe that C compiler Nelson is talking about I believe is actually
Synder's that Jay either ported from ITS  or WAITS.

We had some form of the Synder compiler on the PDP-10's at CMU in the late
1970s.
It was either Mike Accetta or Fil Aleva that wrote a program to read PDP-10
backup tapes, that I updated to deal with TOPS-20/TENEX 'dumper' format
which was similar/only different.
