Interesting, thanks!  1947, then.
As you know well the BSD people dropped their calendar instead of
fixing it.

(Only to clarify that =E2=80=9Eb=C3=B6gge=E2=80=9C is not a German word to =
the best of my
knowledge.  I was looking, as it sounded so =C2=BBnorthern=C2=AB, there is
=C2=BBBodden=C2=AB for example (a small bay with a very small aperture to
the sea), but no?)

That not me.  If me, then Schopenhauer.  I also do not like the
Brainfuck language, for example.  You know, if you have to go
somewhere ...  In some Bhuddhistic monasteries, for example, monks
sit cross-legged in front of walls for hours each day.  If you
really want, that will help, if you have learned the lesson.
Working in a kitchen garden is also advisable, you can reap.

 |Electrical circuits can have "bad connections" so I do wonder if Edison \

I seem to recall now that the bug story was clarified in the past
already?  Now it is for me anyway, thank you all for that.  I was
looking at BSD calendar mail and had a go.
