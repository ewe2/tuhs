Yes, I meant output.  Thanks for refreshing my hazy memory.  I found
the TU58 technical manual online.  It turns out that the TU58 did have
a data buffer, but it's only 128 bytes, so transferring each 512-byte
block required multiple messages and interrupts, and that introduces
the overrun/underrun problems.

Most large VAX timesharing systems used the DH11.
