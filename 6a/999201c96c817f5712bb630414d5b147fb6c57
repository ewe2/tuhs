It's rare event when I disagree with you, Clem (sometimes it seems like
we were separated at birth :)  If it was compat by default then you
wouldn't learn any of the new stuff.  

set compatible

isn't that hard but we'd have to read docs to find that.  

Anyhoo, cross reference to Ted's thought that Linux didn't have to 
deal with the Gods of BSD so they could rip stuff out and try again,
his point is that worked better than the BSD way.  Compat is fine
but if you want progress, sometimes you break compat.

For me, I've got a .exrc that I've been carrying around for decades
(has maps in it for some compat bindings to an editor I used on CP/M,
it's _that_ old) and vim is perfectly happy with it.

I mostly use vim as a vi compat but I regularly use 2 panes, that's
super useful.  It's progress and you can have compat mode easily,
seems like a win.
