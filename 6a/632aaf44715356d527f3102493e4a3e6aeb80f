Follow-up to Larry's "Mushi! Mushi!" story
(http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2017-February/008149.html).

I showed this to a Japanese acquaintance, who found it hilarious for a
different reason. He told me that a s/w bug is "bagu" -- a
semi-transliteration -- and "mushi" is "I ignore you".  So corporate
called, asked for status, and the technical guy said "I am going to
ignore you!" and then hung up.
