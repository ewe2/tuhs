Yeah - they are different, but I'm pretty sure that Dale's work in CB UNIX
came first.   I know I saw the CB/UNIX code as hacks to PWB 1.0 I think
(maybe 2.0) when I was still at CMU in 1978 (Phil Karn had it IIRC).   I
was under the impression that folks at Summit (e.g. UNIX Support Group) had
the job of collecting different features that had been done and putting
them into the AT&T 'Standard' for the operating companies.  I agree it
would be interesting to learn who did the work.  But as I always understood
it, Dale's team gave the CB/UNIX stuff to the USG folks who reimplemented
it, I thought because USG was redoing the memory code and wanted something
that would integrate better.   I suspect it is also possible, Dale and his
team redid it in the key of System V at some point and pushed it back.
