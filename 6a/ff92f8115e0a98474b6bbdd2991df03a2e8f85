Sadly, this is just the stuf from the K&P book and not the Virtual OS.
The Virtual OS was considerably more than what K&P did but was built on
their ideas.  It is really sad to think that this, like so much else of
computing history, has been lost.  It should make people appreciate the
work of Warren and PUPS to preserve Unix even more!!

All the best.
