I know of none before this that tried to truly 'clone' all the (v6) kernel
functionality and many tools.

Thoth Thucks....   [Kelly Booth gave me one of these tee's years go].

Mike Malcolm did not try to clone UNIX - for one thing, it was in B [which
Steve Johnson has spread the gospel of same on his sabbatical).  It was not
until the Thoth rewrite that became QNX that they tried to ensure all of
the Unix behaviors and APIs.  Mike was certainly had an influence by UNIX
and IIRC his thesis and the Thoth papers reference/compare it.

The first non-C style mostly cone was Holt's Tunis in the early 1980-s (in
Euclid IIRC - which is similar to, but different from, Hansen and Wirth's
Concurrent-Pascal).
