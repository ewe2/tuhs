This is one of the reasons I liked E when I first used it: it was modal, 
but it started in edit mode.  (Also you KNEW what mode you were in, which 
I understand isn't always the case with vi, although it usually is in the 
clones iirc?)

And I still use nano - which is a rewrite of pico.

pico Just Works(R)(TM)(C), and it's not enormous.  nano adds a few things 
I like, but the UI is the same.  Heck...I still use PINE and am sending 
this message from it ;)

-uso.
