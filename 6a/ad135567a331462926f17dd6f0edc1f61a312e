Here's what we have:

1st Ed: http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/research/Dennis_v1/1stEdman.html
2nd Ed: http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/research/Dennis_v2/unix_2nd_edition_manual.pdf
3rd Ed: http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/research/Dennis_v3/v3man.tar.gz
4th Ed: http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/research/Dennis_v4/v4man.tar.gz

but I haven't scanned in the 5th Ed manuals yet :-(

Cheers,
	Warren
