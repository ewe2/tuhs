bsd 2.11 has 6 different magic numbers. The three extra are one flavor of
overlays that does the itself, and two flavor that do it automatically
(I've not plumbed the depths of the code to know what that means) with
separate I&D and one without.

HP-UX had a weird form of COFF in the early days. IBM AIX had its own thing
that wasn't quite COFF, nor was it quite a.out. Apollo also had a variation
on COFF that wasn't quite standard. I wrote a symbol mangler for all of
these in the early 90s and each one was its own special snowflake.

pecoff is also used for UEFI binaries... Though the subset that's used tends
to be smaller than what windows itself uses.
