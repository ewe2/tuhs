Yeah - I always found that a bit weird, having to use socketpair()
to get a bidirectional "pipe".

Err - granted on the open; but if my memory serves, close() has been
supported on them ever since I started using them ('87).  Otherwise
the normal fork/dup/close/exec pattern for child processes would not
work.

Now what would have been useful is a way to have distinct fd's for
the local read and write end of (e.g.) a TCP socket - such that one
direction could be closed w/o closing the other.  Or maybe some
fcntl() to dup the bidirectional fd in to a pair of unidirectional
fds.  That way one could dispense with shutdown for closing one
direction, making children and fd passed programs socket agnostic.
