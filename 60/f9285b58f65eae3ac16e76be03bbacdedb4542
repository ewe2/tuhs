OK, from my Toastmasters experiences (DTM, senior executive, etc), here's 
some feedback...

Find out how much time you have, and rehearse them in front of someone 
with a stopwatch and time cards (in TM, green means OK so far i.e. past 
the minimum time, yellow means start winding down, red means sit down, 
because in TM contests you are disqualified if you get the red).  You'll 
find that people have no idea for how long they can talk, once they get 
carried away...

> Ninja Greg does music (have to do this one, I have pictures).

Agreed (and being a muso I'd like to see those pix myself).

> Ninja Greg bitch slaps the government with Larry

Possibly not...  More about you than Greg.

> Ninja Greg takes Larry to the NSA, Larry ends up staring at pissed Marines

Ditto...

> Ninja Greg gets Larry a wife

Keep it if there's time i.e. run it last.  A short presentation is more 
memorable than a long one.

> Happy Greg lifts a log (have to do this one, I have pictures)

Definitely (I saw the pix).
