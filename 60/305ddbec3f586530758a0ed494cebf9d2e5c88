Subject: [TUHS] history of termios?
Message-ID: <20091028192805.GL2041@arwen.poofy.goof.com>

before I do some code spelunking, does anyone here know the history of
termios?  I've been doing some serial programming recently and wondering
how things got to the way they are...  why is VTIME an inter-character
timer instead of a timer for an entire VMIN block, for instance?
