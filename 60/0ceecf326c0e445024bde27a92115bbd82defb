Not that I haven't done that sort of thing myself, but my favourite
one was a Tandem customer whose programmers had come from a different
system, and they knew that the correct way to terminate a program was
to jump to absolute location 0.  And how about that, it worked!

One day we received a problem report that CPU 4 of their system would
reliably fail at 16:04 every day.  We spent a long time puzzling over
it: there was kernel data corruption of a kind we had never seen
before.  TL;DR: it seems that the jump to 0, in combination with a
kernel library bug, had interpreted the "instruction" at location 0 to
modify this particular location in kernel memory.  More details at
