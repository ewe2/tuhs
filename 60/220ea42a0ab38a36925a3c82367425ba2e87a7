Bittorrent is a complex situation, some ISPs were ordered by a court to block
it.

As to Skype, I agree ISPs shouldn't block sites - but if you read my message,
I already said that.

Fine, you pay your money, you get X Mbits/second.

If you (or the site you're getting bits from) wants _more_ than X
Mbits/second, charging you - or them, which is I gather mostly what ISPs want
to do - for that privilege is a problem... how?
