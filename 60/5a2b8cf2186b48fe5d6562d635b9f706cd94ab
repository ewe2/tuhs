Subject: Why upper case configuration file names in BSD?
Message-ID: <20000204084928.E26290@freebie.lemis.com>

I've just been asked a rather unusual question: when you build a BSD
kernel, the name of the configuration file is traditionally upper
case.  Does anybody have insight as to why this should be?

The same reason that Makefile has an upper-case first letter -- so it
appears early in an ls listing, rather than in the middle of a big
long list.

Because that's how the founding fathers at Berkeley had it!

I have no knowlegde, but a guess. Berkeley must have had different
machines with different hardware configurations.  Conditional
compilation is done with a dependency flag. GENERIC defines -DGENERIC.
A MICROVAX file would imply -DMICROVAX. It may be for this reason
only, conventions.

I've always done mine lowercase.  I wasn't aware I was violating any sort
of tradition.
