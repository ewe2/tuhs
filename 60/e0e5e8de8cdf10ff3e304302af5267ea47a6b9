I don't *think* that was it - I remember seeing those boxes at some  
trade show later, but this was a different animal - it was really a  
piece of test equipment for embedded processors (actually it might  
have been a socket-level simulator, that you used to replace an 1802  
or something so you could see what it was doing) I think.  It almost  
certainly had a serial console (which would have been a Tek graphics  
terminal of course _ I think it had a pair of them), and I am  
reasonably sure the thing that ran it all was a PDP-11 of some kind  
(poresumably a small one, because the whole system was not enormous).
