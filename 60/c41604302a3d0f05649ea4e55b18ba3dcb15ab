We generally say we have tens of thousands of machines deployed worldwide
in our CDN. We don't give out specific numbers though.

I can tell you it's about both. We recently started encrypting all traffic,
which requires a crapton of CPU. Plus, we're doing sophisticated network
flow modeling to reduce congestion, which takes CPU. On our 100G boxes,
which we get in the low 90's encrypted, we have some spare CPU, but almost
no space memory bandwidth and our PCI lanes are full of either 100G network
traffic or 4-6 NVMe drives delivering content up at about 85-90Gbps.

Most of our other boxes are the same, with the exception of the 'storage'
tier boxes. Those we're definitely hard disk I/O bound.
