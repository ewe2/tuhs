Clem was in "the club".  I do remember those times, barely, I was a 
bit too young to have a clear view of things.  But it certainly
seemed like some Universities made the source pretty available.
UW Madison was not one of those, I had to beg and plead to get 
access to the source.

So Clem's memory is fine, his experience was you could get the source.
But that wasn't the universal experience at all, and I agree with
Ted that just getting access to the source doesn't make it remotely
open source.
