I'd argue that stateful is really hard to get right when machines panic
or reboot.  Maybe you can do it on the client but how does one save all
that state on the server when the server crashes?

NFS seems simple in hindsight but like a lot of things, getting to that
simple wasn't chance, it was designed to be stateless because nobody
had a way to save the state in any reasonable way.
