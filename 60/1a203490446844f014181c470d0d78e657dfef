We used PWB at Ford Aerospace in the late 70s. It might have been
the closest to a commercial Unix version there was back then. John 
Mashey had a lot to do with PWB so maybe he can say a few words about
it if he's on here.

It's ironic - back in the late 70s there were almost as many
variations of Unix as there are Linux distributions now. It made the
commercial software vendors crazy because each required separate
development and QA resources, and none of them had enough traction
to be the only version that a vendor would support (like maybe
RedHat now).
