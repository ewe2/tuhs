Sorry for typo and top posting on my iPhone for a few days as I'm traveling
W/O a computer.

Some thoughts.

There a number of pdp11 stacks for ip and I assume we the ncp but they were
not all sourced by bbn.  A number were in assembler

As Noel pointed out the first widely distributed Unix implementation for
the ncp was the uici version.  But there was a Rand stack around the same
time and III ty hink Holmgren ended up at UCSB after his time at UICI.  Im
fairly sure there was cross polinartion but I don't know how much.

In the IP space the 11 assembler version was the first u knew about.  The
first C version was the Haverty stack that became what knew of as the
portable IP stack originally for the Nova.   Rob Gurwitz (working) for Jack
did the 4.1 code and was the original official Vax stack for DARPA.  Joy's
reimplementation for 4.1a was sort of unsanctioned and caused a bit of a
rift as it was not a complete rewrite and officially BBN was doing the
network support for the VAX for DARPA. CSRG was just supposed to being
doing base OS.

But the joy version is derrived from the Gurwitz/Havert work - For instance
the famous mbuf code came from the DG Nova implementation a few years
earlier.  [I was once told mbufs came from Brown, but Jack said on the IH
mailing list in the last year or so, he worked on them before Rob started
his work].

Stan and I only had assembler and BLISS and Fortran on the Vax under VMS so
I started at the DG version when we did something similar in the Tek
version [it was not as elegant or as complicated and probably not as good].

As for other NCPs, PARC had MAXC on the net, but I thought it had
originally a DG Nova front end that was replaced with an Alto.  But the NCP
ran as Nova code in BCPL in both.
