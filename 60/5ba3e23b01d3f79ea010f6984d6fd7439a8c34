Yeah, that's pretty much what we did.  Conceptually, the client said 
"please connect me to Sydney's pogo stick server", and the server said "I 
am the Sydney pogo stick server".  Networking as it ought to be (none of 
this business about the right phase of the moon and looking for a few 
all-too-scarce virgins etc).  The config stuff was initially in flat 
files, and it was my job to convert the lot to OpenLDAP lookups.
