/me raises a white flag.

I can tell you what's special about mail from that subscriber.

I have leading industry standard email security enabled on my email. 
Things like DKIM and DMARC which are specifically designed to tell 
receiving email servers where email from my domain should come from and 
what to do with email that does not come from my servers.

So, receiving servers that are also running leading industry standard 
filters honor my settings and reject the messages that claim to be from 
me but do not come from my mail server.  -  Mailman naively interprets 
this as a bounce.

Suffice it to say, that email server industry is changing and mailing 
lists are going to have to change to keep up with the times.

This problem is happening to a lot of mailing lists and will start 
happening to more and more as more of the email industry adopts things 
like DKIM and DMARC.

Note:  Multiple governments around the world are strongly desiring 
things like DKIM and DMARC.  Germany is probably a leader.  US senators 
are asking US governmental agencies to follow suit.  -  Suffice it to 
say, that more and better email security is coming.  (I'm just an early 
adopter.)
