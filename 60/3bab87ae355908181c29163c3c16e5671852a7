Hardly,  in my 45+ years, I have seen way more C projects than C++.  The C
projects tended to last longer, have a more profound impact and many are
still being developed.   I've been at Intel for the last qtr of my career and
without a doubt, C is the #1 language in use internally, with C++ probably
#2.   Most of our work is actually in user space, although obviously we do
a great deal of low-level work.  The Intel compilers are a mix of both
languages.  That said, as we move to more LLVM work (we actually have the
largest number of paid LLVM developers ).

For your amusement check out:  https://www.archer.ac.uk/status/codes/
Archer is a large HPC site in the UK.  Many supercomputer centers off
similar stats, but I often point to Archer because it easy to get an
understanding of what programming languages are used for codes that are
actually used in day-to-day production.

That said, I personally am the most excited about Go theses day, but I'm
also thinking Rust looks pretty interesting, but my experience with both
compared to C is extremely nominal.  Neither language is used for anything
in production in our world at this point.
