SCO's whole story is just TOO bizarre... (Score:3, Interesting)

I mean, who could have thought of a worse, more stupid way to piss off the
whole tech sector and drive yourself into bankruptcy. The more I think about
it, the more this strange idea develops that SCO (Caldera) is actually doing
all this rubbish to help the Linux community. OK, it is way out there, but in
some perverted way, it makes sense.

First of all, you have a Linux company (Caldera) who, despite their best
efforts, has trouble staying afloat. At this time, there is no corporate
support for Linux, the big vendors are running away from it, and the "GPL has
never been tested in court" is touted as an argument all over the place. Big
UNIX vendors only see Linux as a way to get people into their more proprietary
solutions.

So, Caldera buys out a UNIX vendor and does the most ridiculous thing
imaginable: sues everybody, proclaims that Linux is communist and all that
bullshit. Fast forward to the current situation: IBM, HP, Novell and other big
players are squarely behind Linux and protecting it. Microsoft is exposed as a
greedy monopolist who uses underhand tactics (yet again). GPL gets tested in
court and it is under such circumstances that guarantee a strong precedent in
GPL's favour. The UNIX heritage is cleared once and for all. Linux wins, in a
BSD fashion, and is free from corporate FUD. And who pays the bill? Greedy
investors.

This could turn out the be the best thing for the corporate image of Linux
ever.
