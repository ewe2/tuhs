Hi All.

As mentioned a few weeks ago, I have a full set of the O'Reilly X11 books
from the early 90s.  

I'm willing to send them on to a better home for the cost of mailing
from Israel.

One person said they were interested but didn't follow up with me, so
I'm again offering to the list.  First one to get back to me wins. :-)

Thanks,

Arnold
