Subject: [TUHS] Can't load split I&D files (in one PDP-11/23 PLUS)
Message-ID: <f7f1e0d30906251157v2c62c5f5wf0dd4c291ea4cb80@mail.gmail.com>

Well, the matter is simple: I'm trying to install 2.11 BSD in one PDP-11/23
PLUS with 4MB of ram, and the 'restor' and 'icheck' utilities don't load in
he PDP, returning this message:

  "Can't load split I&D files"

I tried with the diverse distributions of Vtserver and diverse versions of
'restor'. In the case of the 2.9BSD this don't happen but the utility can't
understand what is the 'vt' device.

Someone has encountered and solved this problem ?

Regards
Sergio
