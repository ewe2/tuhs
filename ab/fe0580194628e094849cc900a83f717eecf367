The term for that, in relation to something that clearly is a matter of 
peoples' reputations, business survivability, etc, is "due diligence".

That is truly "viral licensing".  GPL at least has the grace and honesty to be 
up-front about it, and only if the binaries get published.  Real "viral 
licensing' acts much the way virii do - beneath the skin, out of sight.

That is pretty much what I allege SCO is in fact doing.  By extending the 
meaning of "derived" to include practically anything, from just 
sniffing/looking at an AT&T letterhead to copying the whole kit and caboodle, 
they have rendered their contentions null and void, AFAIC.

Which is the problem with MS's "Shared Source" - developers are staying away 
from it in droves, because nobody can do anything even remotely useful with 
the source code.

"Due diligence" of course.  You can take out an airline on that basis (Air New 
Zealand springs to mind), much less a little company like SCO's.  And "due 
diligence" is the more positive approach to it - a vengeful approach talks of 
"wilful deception", "fraudulent claims", "defamation of character", and 
suchlike.  "Lack of due diligence" is mild.
