Acme was definitely inspired by Oberon the system. I visited ETH a number
of times in the '80s and there were some properties of Oberon I found
attractive. Acme definitely grew out of thinking I did there, but of course
it was not tied to any language (unlike Oberon or an IDE), but rather
integrated the Plan 9 command environment. Also, the button 3
context-getting thing was completely new, and when I spoke at ETH later
about Acme, Wirth singled out that feature as something of interest.

Sam predates all that.
