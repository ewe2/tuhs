Both NetBSD and FreeBSD emerged from the 'patchkit' efforts that would take
the good accumulated patches from the net to 386BSD and apply them to try
to cobble together some kind of distribution. It was after Jolitz refused
to play ball with other people at all. It's unfortunate he was the one to
bring 386BSD to market from the net2 distribution in many ways, since it
spawned a Diaspora that's been a mixed blessing: A diversity of platforms
has has lead to more experimentation. It's also lead to a bunch of
duplicated effort when that experimentation lead to a system that made it
hard to share.

Of course, Jolitz wasn't the only strong personality in the early days that
had issues working with others, which also contributed to the Net/Free
split, the later Open/Net split and the even later Free/Dragonfly split...

Then again, Linux is no paragon of people working together either...
There's numerous examples where stupid technical things were done because
of personality disputes (exhibit A: systemd, even Linus can't stop it).

I'm with you there, even if we have some denominational differences :)
