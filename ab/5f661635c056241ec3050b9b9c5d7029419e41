See below for a session log showing booting 6th Ed Unix on a Linux system.

I'm pretty sure that by 6th Ed the system was mostly C, with only a
few assembly routines.

High-resolution bit-mapped graphics at any reasonable price came along
a few years after 6th Ed.  Unix.  Character-cell CRT terminals that
could display 72x12 up to 80x24 characters on a screen were available
in 1975, but were pretty expensive.

Instructions for booting "uv6swre" are contained in the file "simh_swre.txt".
To make things easier for myself, I did the following:
$ cp unix0_v6_rk.dsk rk0.dsk
and so on for 1, 2, 3.
This gives me copies of the distribution disks that I can work with
without losing the originals.  Then I made a startup file "run.conf"
to contain the commands for the emulator.  Here is the result of a
very recent session:

Notes:  the simh command for emulating a Unibus PDP11 with 18-bit
addressing is now "set cpu u18".

In the line "@unix" the "@" is the prompt from the boot program, "unix"
is your response to it.  Root has no password.

The disks are mounted	rk1 on /usr
			rk2 on /usr/source
			rk3 on /mnt

The default character erase and line kill characters shown by stty
are not what anyone is used to these days.
