Subject: [TUHS] ld (was v6tar from v7 on v6, too large?)
Message-ID: <201512102108.tBAL8ljr025838@mail.cs.Dartmouth.EDU>

That's exactly right. ld performs the same task as LOAD did on BESYS,
except it builds the result in the file system rather than user
space. Over time it became clear that "linker" would be a better
term, but that didn't warrant canning the old name. Gresham's law
then came into play and saddled us with the ponderous and
misleading term, "link editor".
