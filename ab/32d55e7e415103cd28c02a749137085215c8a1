Hi all

Firstly, I have done this before, but due to age/stress/tiredness/whatever,
I can't remember what I did!

I am using Warren's/Fred's vtserver program to install BSD2.11 on an 11/53.

I have installed the root.dump file (and all the steps beforehand) and now
my '53 boots into 2.11.  So far so good!

I now need to restore the usr file systems - all the stuff in file6/7/8.tar

How do I do this still using Vtserver.

Someone remind me please!

Regards


Kevin Murrell
