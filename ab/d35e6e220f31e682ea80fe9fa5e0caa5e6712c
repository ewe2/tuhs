In case you're interested, I've located a reference manual at
http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp7/F-75P_PDP7prelimUM_Dec64.pdf

The instruction set is very reminiscent of the PDP-8, including the
"operate" class "microcodding" instructions (starting with 7) and
autoindexing via indirect access to locations 10 to 17.  Even the
mnemonics and the assembler syntax are very similar to the -8.

Certainly the PDP-11 is an improvement, but there's something
nostalgic about the -7 instruction set.
