Subject: [TUHS] Getting UNIXs for 16-bit 8086
Message-ID: <Law14-F478ES092DaCd000523bd@hotmail.com>

warren

you missunderstood my point , I didn't imply it has at&t code !, what I 
meant is it has the look and feel of at&t unix and indeed it was modeled (if 
you prefer instead of derived :-) ) after unix 6 as per the author and the 
way it look and feel.

as for the book , yup I read both the original book and the second one , 
that's what I meant it's an educational project oriented towards students.

cheers
