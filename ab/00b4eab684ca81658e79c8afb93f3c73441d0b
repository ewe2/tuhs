While I was involved, the Sun User Group made three tapes of freely
available software, in 1985, 1987, and 1989.  The 1989 tape includes
both of the earlier ones, as well as new material.

A copy of both the 1987 tape and the 1989 tape are here:

I'll have to do a bit more digging to turn up more than vague memories
about our dealings with the lawyers...
