Subject: [TUHS] 4.3BSD help: getty ignoring modem status
Message-ID: <20170319055736.GA26709@minnie.tuhs.org>

Hi all, over on the uucp project we are struggling with a problem. If a
user is logged in with telnet, and they disconnect the telnet session,
their shell hangs around. The next person that telnets in gets the shell.

SimH, with the -a -m flags on a simulated DZ line, has these modem flags:

Telnet connected:    Modem Bits: DTR RTS DCD CTS DSR
Telnet disconnected: Modem Bits: DTR RTS         DSR

So, DCD and CTS are being dropped, but getty (or something) isn't responding
and (presumably) sending a HUP signal to the shell.

Is there anybody with some modem or getty knowledge that can help?

Thanks, Warren
