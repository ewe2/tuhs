 |Well, CTRL-<*> is usually just the <*> character with the high bits \

 |So, to have a printing representation of NULL, you have two character \
 |choices
 |- SPACE, and '@'. Printing "^ " is not so hot, so "^@" is better.

 |the DEL. So if you just take a CTRL character and set the 0100 bit, \
 |and print
 |it as "^<char>", you get something readable.

You xor it via toupper(X)^0x40, yes of course.  My code is right,
it is just the manual that is incomplete or even false: i will
clarify it.  It is just that i know that many people which use
free software don't know what a xor operation is, at least without
looking into Wikipedia.  (And even though i use it frequently
myself, that is often contaminated by politics, just yesterday
i had a hard time with some paragraphs on the German Wikipedia
page on intellectual properties.)
