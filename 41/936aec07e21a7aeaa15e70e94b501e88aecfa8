I completely agree.  Studying and >>learning<< from V6 allows you to
consider the basics of what any good OS, no just a UNIX-like system, has to
do provide simple but complete services.  Examining V6 not most of the
things you find today removes a lot of the noise, like threading, parallel
execution, vm, networking, which are fine topics for later, but Warner is
right - get a solid understanding first.  It also helps to understand what
makes 'UNIX-ness' and why it was different from anything before it came on
the scene.

BTW: It' why I still like Pascal (Delphi) over C or C++ as a first language
(I admit, I'm leaning towards Go these days, but Go lacks a good teaching
text).  This is what I heard Doug saying.   IMO:  Lion's book and the V6,
can be considered 'old' by contemporary standards, but they are still 100%
appropriate and because the book and code is so simple, the teacher and the
student can focus on what really matters (*i.e.* learning to walk carefully
in a directed manner and get to your destination before you are forced to
run with the bulls and avoid getting run over).
