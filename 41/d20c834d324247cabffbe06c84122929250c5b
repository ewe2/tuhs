Subject: [TUHS] Now that Novell officially owns Unix again...
Message-ID: <w2r8dd2d95c1004011858qec3ad89ai6b81f6f724e0ffb4@mail.gmail.com>

Is anything likely to happen to the status of various historical
Unices? Is Novell likely to keep the Ancient Unix license intact or
are they likely to lock things back up? Is there any chance that
SysIII and early SysV might finally get opened up? Does anybody have
any ideas here?

Mike
