Subject: [TUHS] looking for a quote
Message-ID: <CAP6exYLn6dV7ZLUAojkEhqtZFBYph=yLxcT1nKiuHPvO6pr5YA@mail.gmail.com>

A long time ago, dmr wrote about something that IIRC BSD had done he did
not like: unlimited length identifiers in C, maybe? His argument was that
being too general was not a good thing.

Can't quite find the quote, anyone remember it? Would have been ca. 1980.
