Glad to have helped. Maybe later systems did the symlink.  I'm pretty sure SVR4 and later Linux did
it with symlinks.

SVR4 went overboard - /dev/fd was a separate file system type!

It would seem that this handful of lines could have been in Unix as early as 4th Edition — but they weren’t. Maybe it was not seen as useful.
