Arnold, I agree, I do remember seeing it on what I think was the PWB 4.0
tape.  IMHO: it was before cshell, termcap, vi et al was released inside of
the rest of the Bell System and there seemed to be sometimes "SW from BSD
be bad/crude" 'tude.  IIRC ber and mmp must have had it running on the
Marx's brothers systems in Whippany.  But he had vi, so I personally never
used it.

@Mary Ann - this would have been around the time you were in Columbus and
starting the terminfo work.  Do you have any memories?
