Noel,

Thanks for your reply.

I had suspected that the Unix behaviour was responsible, and you've made
that clear with the "line at a time" assertion. I tried removing echo in
STTY, but haven't tried raw.

<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; I&#39;m struggling however with how C processes the IO. =
It seems that when I<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; type at the console, my typing is immediately echoed to =
my terminal<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; window. ...=C2=A0 nothing appears on the terminal until =

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; the system displays the whole line of input ... How<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; can I suppress the original C/Unix echo, and get my outp=
ut to appear<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; immediately?<br>
<br>
This is not a C issue; it&#39;s the Unix I/O system (and specifically, term=
inal I/O).<br>
<br>
Normally, Unix terminal input is done line-at-a-time: i.e. the read() call =
to<br>
the OS (whether for 1 character, or a large number) doesn&#39;t return unti=
l an<br>
enire line has been typed, and [Retrurn] has been hit; then the entire line=
 is<br>
available. While it&#39;s being buffered by the OS, echoing is done, and ru=
bout<br>
processing is also performed.<br>
<br>
One can suppress all this; there&#39;s a mode call &#39;raw&#39; (the norma=
l mode is<br>
sometime labelled &#39;cooked&#39;) which suppresses all that, and just giv=
es one the<br>
characters actually typed, as they are typed. The stty() system call can be=
<br>
used to turn this on.<br>
<br>
See the V6 tty(IV) manual entry for more. stty() is in stty(II).<br>
