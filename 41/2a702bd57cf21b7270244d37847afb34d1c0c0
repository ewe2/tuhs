To the best of my knowledge civilized tribes never used paper, but
their hands and either sand or water.
Then a little bit of (creme or) oil for the rosette muscle.

On what i hear, the thing about japanese toilets seems to be that
they are so clean that you can drink their water.  (I hope this
sentence isn't inappriate.)
