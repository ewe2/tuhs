Noel,

I followed the thread you provided and I appreciate the direction. 
estabur(who thought these names up, I know 8 characters is limiting, but 
c'mon) is indeed the culprit:
         if(sep) {
                 if(cputype == 40)
                         goto err;

I'm gathering (read still investigating) that the 411 header is read by 
a loader and the call to estabur is made with a value for sep indicating 
that it is a split I+D binary, then the cputype is checked and sure 
enough, it's a PDP-11/40 and the error is generated.

Thanks,

Will
