Subject: [TUHS] Hello World compiled in v1/v2
Message-ID: <CADxT5N4nxJWvtS19Xfsnce8ticuEGqPL2-VS7fKEfrypMqh6kw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

Yes I have managed to compile Hello World on v1/v2.

the cp command seems different from all other versions, I'm not sure I
understand it so I used the mv command instead which worked as
expected.

I had to "as crt0.s" and put crt0.o in /usr/lib and then it compiled
without issue.

Is the kernel in /etc? I saw a core file in /etc that looked like it
would be about the right size. No unix file in the root directory
which surprised me.

At least I know what crt0.s does now. I guess a port of unirubik to
v1/v2 is in the cards (maybe).

Mark
