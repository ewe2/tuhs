And SCCS was way easier than anything you could do with cards.
My first experience with PWB was maintaining the source code and QA for =
a project that was targeted at RSX-11M.

Amusingly, it as my job twice at different facilities (BRL and Rutgers) =
to get rid of all the card processing equipment.

I finally offered to move the Cyber RJE station and its accompanying =
keypunch machine into the office of the last person using it.   He =
finally decided he'd make the jump to timesharing.
Amusingly, nobody figured out how to make CyberRJE work from a PDP-11.   =
The labs had purchased a half dozen PDP-11/34s with a optical card =
reader, line printer, and graphical display (Vector General) and a DQ-11 =
and 56K (them was fast in those days) short haul modem.

Of course, in Mike Muuss's typical style, he said we could use them.    =
They all got recycled into graphics workstations.   Mike wrote a driver =
for the Vector General and the first ersatz "BRL CAD" package.    We =
still used the card reader to read in old "COMGEO" graphic model decks =
which CAD could edit.

UNIX for the 11/34 (a hybrid V6 kernel), we installed overlays.    When =
TCP/IP came around which needed another segment register for mbufs, we =
just couldn't make it work anymore on a non-split-I/D machine.    The =
VGs got moved over to the 11/70's and I recycled the 34's into internet =
routers.    We actually used the DQ's and modems for internal =
communciations for a while until we subsequently bought IMPs and later =
Proteon rings.
