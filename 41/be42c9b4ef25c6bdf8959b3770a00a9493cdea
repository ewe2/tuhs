I did a lot with OS-9 too, both Level One on the Color Computer 2 and
Level Two on the Color Computer 3.  The CC3 had a very primitive memory
manager, no faulting, but would allow 8k chunks from up to a 512k pool
of memory to be mapped into the 64k address space of the 6809.  There
was a C compiler, probably K&R based or a bit before for OS-9.  I ported
a number of the BSD utilities.  I also worked on a implementation of
UUCP and ran a UUCP node and proper domain for email using UUNET as the
provider.  I received email and a bit of Usenet.  I wrote a clone of rn
to read Usenet on the CC3 with OS-9 Level Two.  The block diagram for
6809 OS-9 was very simular to V[small number] Unix, with some notable
differences.  OS-9 is a microkernel probably being the biggest thing and
6809 OS-9 is all written in assembly.  There was a login program that
you could attach to a serial port and actually login with a username and
password and such.  Lots of fun and somewhat Unix like in a lot of
ways.  There was also a 68000 version of OS-9 Level One that I saw
once.  I understand that it may have been mechanically translated from
the 6809 version.  It ran pretty much exactly in the same way.
