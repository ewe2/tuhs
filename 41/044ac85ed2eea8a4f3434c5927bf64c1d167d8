Well, this is nothing special.

Last year, I fixed several aprox. 35 year old bugs in the Bourne Shell while 
doing automated testing after POSIX support was ready.

One was related to the rewrite that was needed to work around the design bug in 
the MC68000 but the other three were interesting:

-	Fixed a bug introduced in 1981 with SYSTEM III that caused continue 
	large-number to break and not to continue the outer loop.

-	Fixed a bug - present since 1977 - that caused an interactive shell 
	that calls "for i in 1 2 3 ; do echo $i; break 0; done" stop working.

-	Fixed a bug introduced in 1981 with SYSTEM III that caused cat 0<<-EOF 
	not to strip leading TABs.
