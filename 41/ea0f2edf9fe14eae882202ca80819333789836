My hardware:
  Mentec M70 with 512kB RAM (that must be enough) which can boot
    from DX DY DL DU DM DB MS MT and has 4 serial ports.
  MSCP/DU-Controller which can boot from DM, DP, DL, DR, MS,
    MT, MU, SY, DU.
  It is connected to a 1.2MB-5.25"-FDD and a MFM-HDD of unknown
    size wich I will get tomorrow. (I have now the dox for my
    controller.)

Kernel:
  To use these 4 serial ports, do I have to set "NKL 4" or are
    these not KL11/DL11s? One of these is the normal console
    unter RT-11.
  Is "NBUF 32" OK for 512kB RAM?
  Should I set UCB_CLIST NO or YES?

Installation:
  I think there are three possible ways of installing it:

  1) Boot from a RT-11-Floppy and transfer the whole disk with
     rtkerm.
     The disk will be bigger than 32MB, so this does not work?

  2) Boot from a RT-11-Floppy and transfer the root-fs and the
     swap-partition then boot BSD and transfer somehow the
     usr-data (kermit? write simple program?).
     This sould also install the disklabel.

  3) Boot from a BSD-Floppy, disklabel, mkfs, transfer data
     (kermit? write simple program?).

  The kernel and diskimages will allways be made on an emulator.

  What do you think is the best/easiest way? Or have you a better
  idea? (Make a tape and use the TU58-emulator?)


Thanks

I'm using 2.11_rp_unknown[1] an the newest version of the supnik emulator.

When I'm compiling a kernel (with the newest 2.11BSD sources), I get
at the end:

./checksys unix
overlay 6 is empty and there are non-empty overlays following it.
System will occupy 156960 bytes of memory (including buffers and clists).

               end {0052310}          nbuf {0012014}           buf {0033654}
             nproc {0012002}          proc {0042454}         ntext {0012004}
              text {0051350}         nfile {0012010}          file {0047370}

         namecache {0025242}       _iosize {0010030}
**** SYSTEM IS NOT BOOTABLE. ****
*** Exit 1

then I get very often Bus Errors:

# ./config SONJA

#

I configured the emulator with 1MB RAM. I compiled it with and without
optimization.

Is this a problem with the distribution, with the emulator or with
the compiler (gcc 2.7.2.1)?

Hmm, Steven Schultz did find yet another bug in Bob's emulator which fixed
the crashing vi problem. As Steven knows heaps more about 2.11 than I, here
are some general purpose suggestions from me.

	+ Manually fsck on bootup. Does that help prevent fs corruption,
	  or is the system killing the filesystem on a regular basis?

	+ Can you build a GENERIC kernel? Does it boot?

	+ The 2.11_rp_unknown disk image was built with the new P11
	  emulator from the Begemot crew. You might try compiling and
	  installing this emulator, and see how 2.11BSD performs.

Anyway, Steven might offer some better advice! Greg Lehey might be able
to provide you with the P11 config files he uses. I've got the new P11
built at home, but I can't get the files on it from work.

I'm off for a short break, but I'll be back Monday. Best of luck with it.

Well, I started an answer, and decided that Steven would be able to
answer better, but since you mention my name, OK, here I am.

One point:

> Is this a problem with the distribution, with the emulator or with
> the compiler (gcc 2.7.2.1)?

First, the compiler is certainly not gcc.  That would never fit in the
address space of a PDP-11.  Secondly, I'd guess it's the emulator.  I
don't think many people have tried 2.11BSD on the Supnik emulator.

I'm using the Begemot emulator (Emulators/P11-2.3 in the archive).  I
get:

[5] root--> cd /usr/src/sys/GRANDPA/
[6] root--> ./checksys unix
System will occupy 295600 bytes of memory (including buffers and clists).

               end {0122636}          nbuf {0013562}           buf {0053542}
             nproc {0013550}          proc {0077060}         ntext {0013552}
              text {0121416}         nfile {0013556}          file {0115726}
            ninode {0013554}         inode {0013646}      ncallout {0013560}
           callout {0044274}     ucb_clist {0013566}        nclist {0013564}
          ram_size {0000000}       xitdesc {0013644}      quotdesc {0000000}
         namecache {0053150}       _iosize {0000000}
[7] root--> 

I won't pretend that the documentation of the interpreter is ideal,
nor that it's easy to set up.  It took me quite a while.  Take a look
at the files in ftp://ftp.lemis.com/pub/pups.  They are:

-rw-r--r--  1 root  lemis  11477 May  6 16:18 README-emu
-rw-r--r--  1 root  lemis   1746 May  6 16:18 p11conf
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  lemis    315 May  6 16:19 run_211

README-emu is a brief (and hurried) description of what I did to get
the emulator working, p11conf is my current configuration, and run_211
is the command file I run to actually start the emulator.  Note that
what you get when you run the emulator is just the diagnostic console;
to actually use the machine, you need to telnet to ports 10000 to
10003.  Anybody interested in so doing can telnet to pdp11.lemis.com
and log in as guest, password "Today only".  Don't break anything,
please--I haven't checked security too much.

I managed to get the Sim23b pdp11 emulator running on the v5 unix.
It is hard to believe a 25K kernel....(:+}}..... so much for code
bloat over the years.

My goal is to try to bring it up on a KSR35 hooked up to a headless
pc (386 board in a closet box) on the dos emulator, or whatever would
be the minimal required to get it going.

Can anyone suggest ways to reach that goal?  I am still having no
luck with the Ersatz 2.0 emulator on dos, because I can't seem to
get the incantations right.  I get to the @ prompt, but after
entering unix, it just sits for a bit, the HD spins, and after a
few seconds it is back at the @ prompt.  There is still some magick
mystical juju required (albeit I am the dummy here....(:+\\.....)

I could port a stripped Linux 0.98 kernel maybe, to get it up,
and try that, but I was hoping the dos emulator would run with it.

Any suggestions and pointers are appreciated.

Thanks, and kudos to all the PUPS crew and Dennis Ritchie for
resurrecting the old v5 image.  This kindof makes computing
fun, for a change.....

Now, where did I stash that KSR35.....

Bob Keys.....

Matthias,
	Here are some instructions on getting that RP disk image working
with the Begemot P11 2.3 emulator. These should supplement Greg's email.

	Warren


    	  Running the 2.11BSD RP disk image on the P11 Emulator

Ok, here's how I got P11-2.3 running. Firstly, I extracted the source code
for P11 from the tarball, and built the emulator in the extracted emu
directory. Note: you need lots of virtual memory to build instab.o.

With p11 built, I went into ../run, and copied the following files here:

total 16
-rw-------  1 root  wheel  1562 Apr 22 19:56 mon.help
-rw-------  1 root  wheel   648 Apr 22 19:55 p11conf
-rw-------  1 root  wheel  4096 Dec 12  1994 qna.rom
-rw-------  1 root  wheel   512 Apr 22 19:41 rp.boot

All except p11conf came from ../emu. I had a hard time getting the p11conf
configuration file working, what with the cpp path etc. So I basically made
a p11conf file which doesn't use any #defines. Here it is:


libdir = .
ctrl rl 017774400 0160 4 4000
end
ctrl rp 017776700 0254 5 4000
	0 /usr/local/src/RP_211bsd_root 12
end
ctrl kl
	017777560  060  064 4 ../emu/IOProgs/tty_net  -7 -t 10002
	017776500 0300 0304 4 ../emu/IOProgs/tty_net  -7 -t 10003
end
ctrl mr 017777520 ./rp.boot
end
ctrl lp 017777514 0200 4
end
ctrl tm 017772520 0224 5
end

Note that the emulated RP disk image is at /usr/local/src/RP_211bsd_root.
The number 12 after this is arbitrary, I have no idea what it does.

Now, to run the emulator using the p11conf above from the run directory,
do ../emu/p11 -d &. You can run it in the background as it doesn't require
any keyboard interaction. Then telnet localhost 10002, and hit Return a few
times. You will see:

% telnet localhost 10002

The setup looks more complicated than the supnik emulator. So, I'll
look tomorrow. What I have noticed is, that there is bsdi and freeBSD
mentioned in p11conf but not linux. Does it require a BSD?

Somebody else posted this a few days ago.  Does anybody know how to
view them?  They're in .gif format, and xv only shows me the first

In fact, you can use any port from 10000 to 10003.  They map to
/dev/console and /dev/ttyl1 through /dev/ttyl3 (though for some reason
/etc/ttys doesn't contain entries for the latter two).

I've forgotten what the standard password on root is; I fear it has

it, you will need to rebuild passwd, which will not work otherwise.
Do that in /usr/src/bin/passwd.  If you have trouble, I can send you a

Yes, I think so.  The access to the machine goes via the tunnel
driver, and that would need to be completed for Linux.  The authors
don't use Linux, so they haven't done the work.  They don't use BSD/OS
much any more, so if you are going to install one, FreeBSD is the
obvious choice, especially considering the price differential.

Of course, any old UNIX user should be using BSD anyway, especially if
you want to emulate older BSDs :-)

Using a new approach, I have re-counted the number of floating point
operations for the utilities contained in Unix's bin directory.
According to my results, many important 7th Edition programs such as
adb, awk and tar make heavy use of floating point on the PDP-11.

As you know, my first approach was to simple-mindedly examine every
word of a given program's disk image to come up with an estimate of
the number of floating point operations used by the program.

I would like to thank those who pointed out the shortcoming of this
approach and offered valuable advice on how to achieve my aim of
accurate counts.  Based on these comments, I decided to create a 
full fledged disassembler for the PDP-11.

I have tested my program and believe it produces an exact count of
all floating point operations.

In case you're interested in how my initial estimates compare with 
the new, precise counts, I list those data below as well.

I'll believe this when you pinpoint the instructions.

According to my paper copy of the UV7 manual, it is possible to run V7 on
a machine with no floating point, and the main problem is when compiling
say numeric code.  There's a short section on how to do a build if you
don't have fp (like me on my 11/34).   I think the V7 manual may well be
on line; but if not I can do a Xerox of this if it would be useful,

The Seventh Edition manuals are available in a number of places,
including of course the PUPS archive, but dmr has also put them on the
web at http://plan9.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/index.html.

He put up postscript versions, too.

I emailed him about the possibility of recreating the roff sources,
an I will probably wind up doing that.  Then we will have a working
set of sources for clean copy.

I don't see them at

Great idea.  Keep us posted.

> I'll believe this when you pinpoint the instructions.

Your skepticism spurred me to examine a Unix utility in depth to see 
whether my results hold up.  They do.

According to my count, tar uses 106 floating point operations.  Here
are the first few.  The complete list, tar3.txt, is attached as
well for your perusal. If you'd like to look at the complete 
disassembled code for tar, let me know.

[root at oskar uv7]# ../dis/disuv7.pl < tar | grep ';17'
file header: 410 37400 4254 27422 20270 0 0 1

20562:  STF F0,(R1)   ;174011 
22406:  LDF F0,(R4)+   ;172424 
22410:  STF F0,-(SP)   ;174046 
22460:  LDF F0,(R4)+   ;172424 
22462:  STF F0,-(SP)   ;174046 
22620:  LDF F0,(R4)+   ;172424

24130:  STF F0,-(SP)   ;174046 
26616:  LDF F0,#56200   ;172427 056200 

I chose tar as an example because it is an important utility and
because it is a relatively heavy user of floating point (as guaged
by the number of floating point ops contained in tar).

The following routines in 7th Edition tar appear to use floating 
point:

~_filbuf
~_innum
~atof
~cvt
~ecvt
~fcvt
~gcvt
~isatty
~main
~mktemp

The addresses of these routines, as listed in tar's symbol 
table--see attached file symlisttar.txt--correspond to those of the 
disassembled floating point ops in tar. 

I've learned a lot while responding to the criticisms offered by you 
and others on this list.  Thank you.

Ed

I don't know what the code above is intended to do, but it's not
floating point.  At the very best, it would indicate the use of the
floating point registers for straightforward data moves.  I stand by
my assertion that tar doesn't use floating point, neither in the
Seventh Edition nor elsewhere.

For the fun of it, I took the source of tar from the Seventh Edition
(/usr/src/cmd/tar/tar.c) and compiled it on 2.11BSD.  I had some minor
compilation problems due to different directory structures, which I
solved by #ifdefing out the following code:

#if 0
                        for (j=0; j < DIRSIZ; j++)
                                *cp2++ = dbuf.d_name[j];
                        *cp2 = '\0';
                        close(infile);
                        putfile(buf, cp);
                        infile = open(".", 0);
                        i++;
                        lseek(infile, (long) (sizeof(dbuf) * i), 0);
#endif

I think we can agree that they don't contain FP code.  Here are some
results:

[23] root--> cc -n -s -O tar.c -S
[24] root--> grep -i ldf tar.s
[25] root--> grep -i mul tar.s

atof, cvt, ecvt, fcvt and gcvt are conversion routines which use
floating point, so I can agree that they would contain FP code which,
however, would not be used.  isatty is a library routine which is
simple enough to quote:

/*
 * Returns 1 iff file is a tty
 */

#include <sgtty.h>

isatty(f)
{
        struct sgttyb ttyb;

        if (gtty(f, &ttyb) < 0)
                return(0);
        return(1);
}

Evidently there's no FP code there.

It's fun to go looking for things like this.  But never trust
anything, especially not your own judgement, until you have a couple
of different ways to prove it.  You have the sources there; go ahead
and check them out.

I have the intro and first few manpages of section 1 done so far.
Maybe a week or so and then if someone will proof them.  I will
port them in original roff source, and then make a troff set.
Dennis was wanting someone to tackle an html version.  Alas, my
html is not so good.

It shouldn't be that hard to make HTML directly from the roff source (I
could probably be persuaded to do something like this, given the roff
source first of course!)

I could probably manufacture HTML from roff reasonably rapidly,
assuming the originals are vaguely clean.  I used to do this for a
living at one piunt (:).

Could it be possible that all the floating point calls are part of the crt.0 
initialization libs?!  They may be in there as part of a initialization 
routeen to detect a fp, and use it if it's there, although I really doubt tar 
would really need an fp call at all.. It sounds like some kind of generic 
startup thing..  Unfortunatly I don't have any source to anything at the 
moment... If anyone wants to dive check the startup libs...  Oh well until 
then, I'm just waiting for SCO to send me my no.. :)


TTYL!

Or use programs written already to do that, like RosettaMan (at least
I still call it that, the author changed its name). Here's a blurb
from its announcement.

:: PolyglotMan (nee RosettaMan) is a filter for UNIX manual pages.  It
:: takes as input man pages for a variety of UNIX flavors and produces as
:: output a variety of file formats.  Currently PolyglotMan accepts man
:: pages from the following flavors of UNIX: Hewlett-Packard HP-UX, AT&T
:: System V, SunOS, Sun Solaris, OSF/1, DEC Ultrix, SGI IRIX, Linux, SCO,
:: FreeBSD; and produces output for the following formats: printable
:: ASCII only (stripping page headers and footers), section and
:: subsection headers only, TkMan, [tn]roff, RTF, SGML (soon--I finally
:: found a DTD), HTML, MIME, LaTeX, LaTeX 2e, Perl 5's pod.  Previously
:: <I>PolyglotMan</I> required pages to be formatted by nroff prior to
:: its processing; with version 3.0, it prefers [tn]roff source and
:: usually can produce results that are better yet.
:: 
:: PolyglotMan improves upon other man page filters in several ways: (1) its
:: analysis recognizes the structural pieces of man pages, enabling high
:: quality output, (2) its modular structure permits easy augmentation of
:: output formats, (3) it accepts man pages formatted with the variant
:: macros of many different flavors of UNIX, and (4) it doesn't require
:: modification of or cooperation with any other program.

:: The home location for PolyglotMan is ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:
:: /ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/rman.tar.Z (this is a softlink to the latest,
:: numbered version).  If you discover a bug and you obtained PolyglotMan
:: at some other site, first grab it from this one to see if the problem
:: has been fixed.

This is only for man pages, but probably could take the papers in ms
format and give a rough translation, or hack up polyglotman some to do
ms as well..

I'd like to write a visible front end for Bob's emulator, but I'm not 
sure how to go about doing it.   What I'd like is another window that 
shows the state of the emulator--PC, SP, MMR etc.--in real time.

Any suggestions/ideas?

I'm looking for some advice...

For the first time in umpteen years, I need to make a bootable 7th Edition
system disk on an RL02 that previously had some other O/S on it.  This disk
has to have the swap space, as well.  The machine it will be used on has
256K bytes RAM.

How many blocks should I leave for swap?  Or, to put it another way, what
magic number pair would people suggest I put in the prototype file for the
number of blocks and number of inodes?

Is it possible that you're mistakenly disassembling embedded data as if it
were code?  And perhaps that those data items contain arrangements of byte
values which translate to FP instructions?

The best & only answer here is to consult to xxconf file used to generate
the 7th Edition kernel, as this will tell you how much swap to reserve.

Vanilla V7 didn't come with RL02 support, so all I can give you are the
parameters used for the RL02 images I have here with V7:

rl
tm
root rl 0
swap rl 0
swplo 18000
nswap 2480

In other words, the filesystem should be no bigger than 18,000 blocks.
The mkfs manual says:

       If  the  prototype file cannot be opened and its name con-
       sists of a string of digits, mkfs  builds  a  file  system
       with a single empty directory on it.  The size of the file
       system is the value of proto interpreted as a decimal num-
       ber.  The number of i-nodes is calculated as a function of
       the filsystem size.  The boot program is  left  uninitial-
       ized.

Distribution V7 had roughly 2,600 files & directories. If I had to
set a value, I'd choose 5,000 or so.

Hope this helps,
	Warren

You'd have to disassemble the kernel. Alternatively, consult the
size of the free block list on the disk's image.

I should have thought of that!  Steven told me the same thing last night.

That looks the same as mine.

I had a look in the superblock on a couple of bootable RL02s, and found
18,000.

I knew about using digits for the blocks instead of a proto file, but I
thought it might be safer to specify the number for the inodes.  I tried to
figure it out from the results of icheck but I'm much happier with your
suggestion.

I'll let you know how I get on.  The reason to do this today is two-fold:

    One of my packs is getting flaky, so I want to make a good copy, with
    a clean install (most of mine have lots of localised junk), and

    our department has an Open Day on Wednesday, and I've been coerced
    into running a display of old machines.  The 11T23 is the easiest PDP
    for me to move there.

Thanks for the help!

I wouldn't be *that* surprised by these results. For instance, I believe
that longs are implemented with FP. And I wouldn't be surprised if a few
FP ops were sneaked in to compute some stuff that aren't immediately
appearant.

	It is true that _some_ long arithmetic is done using FP.  The long
	divide is done that way (at least in 2BSD, I've not looked at V7 yet)
	because it is much much less code to convert the operands to FP, do
	the divide, and then convert the result back (the alternative is
	about two pages of code).  Different CPUs handle a fault during a
	double word push to the stack differently, this was a real difficult
	problem to track down and fix.  If during the FP instruction 
	"movfi   fr0,-(sp)" the stackpointer becomes invalid some PDP-11 CPUs
	handle the fault differently.  See 2.11BSD update #150 for the details.

	The C compiler itself did NOT generate FP unless the operands were
	explicitly FP (float or double).  Most C code was 'int' or 'char *'
	and no FP code was needed or used for that.

	FP instructions would be clustered together where the libc.a routines
	were loaded.  The 'ldiv' and 'lrem' routines would have several FP
	instructions close to each other but the rest of the program would
	have very few.  A program such as 'adb' would have a few FP instructions
	in the routines that display the FP registers.  Oh - there's a bug 
	dating back to V7 in adb.  The FP registers for a traced/running 
	process do not display correctly (using adb on a core file works fine).
	Fixed in 2.11 (see update #405) ;-)

That bears out what I disovered by accident yesterday -- looking at a 7th
Edition UK source distribution for 11/23's and other small machines.  The
READ_ME file lists the programs that have possible floating point problems,
or which might be too big using emulation.   I can't remember the details,
but the list had a few surprises.

Most of the C programs have very little FP, and that is mostly due to a
small number of library routines that include FP ops, but one or two
programs are exceptional.

For example, 'factor' has a lot of FP at the beginning, a chunk in the
middle, and a large subroutine near the end, which uses FP to compute
square roots using Newton's method.  factor is written in assembler, not C,
and has much more FP than other things I looked at, but several other
programs use a little.

We've had a regular intake of new subscribers to the PUPS mailing list, so
I thought I'd say Welcome to all the newcomers. There are now 90 people on
the list, and the quantity of messages is increasing daily.

The mailing list is also available in a digest form, which is distributed
twice a week. If you would rather be on the digest list, send mail to
majordomo at minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au with the lines in the body of the mail:

	unsubscribe pups
	subscribe pups-digest

For more information about old UNIX, see the PUPS web pages at
http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/PUPS, and the FAQ in particular.

The most recent news is that both Bob Supnik and the Begemot team have
released new versions of their PDP-11 emulators. A further bug in Bob's
emulator was found by Steven Schultz, so we might see a patch to the
emulator coming out soon.

The PUPS volunteers have been hard at work burning and mailing out the
first batch of CDs containing the PUPS Archive, which is now about 520Megs
in size. We also have about 30 people with authorised access into the
on-line PUPS Archive.

Dion at SCO has promised another batch of new UNIX licenses, which I
should receive in the next few days. When I do, I'll post the details here.

That's all for now. Ciao,

	Warren

I've sent the list of people interested to Kirk. He's still a bit vague,
but is looking at selling a 4-CD set of all the 4BSD releases for a
price around US$100. That's a ballpark number, and will depend on how many
people want the set: the more the cheaper it will be.

I haven't heard back from him for a week or so. Should I ask him what
he is planning?

Please, none of this is for public consumption just yet.

For those who want vi to work before V2.3c is released, the problem is
in the divide instruction.  Look for:

		dst = src / src2;
		if ((dst >= 077777) || (dst < -0100000)) {

and change the second line to:

		if ((dst > 077777) || (dst < -0100000)) {

(Thanks to Steve Schultz for finding this.)

The magtape bootstrap is also broken, that will be fixed in V2.3c as
well.

I agree:  tar doesn't *use* floating point.  

However, from what I can determine the floating point ops in tar are
not some weird way of moving data around, nor is floating point
being used to do long arithmetic as some have suggested.

Compare the first few tar floating point ops with a dummy program 
consisting of a single call to scanf:

tar, 106 floating point ops:

0:  SETD   ;170011 
20532:  STCFD F0,(R1)   ;176011 
20562:  STF F0,(R1)   ;174011 
22406:  LDF F0,(R4)+   ;172424 
22410:  STF F0,-(SP)   ;174046 
22460:  LDF F0,(R4)+   ;172424 
22462:  STF F0,-(SP)   ;174046 
22620:  LDF F0,(R4)+   ;172424 
22622:  STF F0,-(SP)   ;174046 
24124:  LDF F0,4(R5)   ;172465 000004 
24130:  STF F0,-(SP)   ;174046 
26616:  LDF F0,#56200   ;172427 056200 
26622:  STF F0,177732(R5)   ;174065 177732 
etc.

scanf, 106 floating point ops:

000000:  SETD   ;170011 
002764:  STCFD F0,(R1)   ;176011 
003014:  STF F0,(R1)   ;174011 
004346:  LDF F0,(R4)+   ;172424 
004350:  STF F0,-(SP)   ;174046 
004420:  LDF F0,(R4)+   ;172424 
004422:  STF F0,-(SP)   ;174046 
004560:  LDF F0,(R4)+   ;172424 
004562:  STF F0,-(SP)   ;174046 
004750:  LDF F0,4(R5)   ;172465 000004 
004754:  STF F0,-(SP)   ;174046 
006410:  LDF F0,#56200   ;172427 056200 
006414:  STF F0,177732(R5)   ;174065 177732 

So it would appear that whatever floating point there is in tar comes 
from library routines which have been linked in, but which tar does 
not use.

Hi all!

I want to tell you all how sorry I am for spamming occuring from this site.
Due to several reasons it was possible to exploit the lintilla service 
machines.
We hope we have put an end to it now (it was not an easy task since it 
involved *cringe* beurocracy).

If anybody receives spams from lintilla.df.lth.se or lintilla2.df.lth.se 
from now on please let me know! It should not happen but....

The lintilla services machines does not approve to spam and we try to 
fight back as hard as we are able.

Internet used to be a happy place where people helped eachother and where
life was simple and good. Sometimes I long for those days now gone. =(
Today it seems that greed and abuse is the rule...

Again, sorry for the inconvenience that spamming from this site has caused!

Sincerely yours:
Lars Persson, the Lintilla services.

OK, this may not be *exactly* the right place to ask this.....

I'm in the process of acquiring a PDP-11/34, on which I intend to run *some* flavor of UNIX.  I also have a Cipher F-880 tape drive, which I would like to interface with the PDP-11.  Reading between the lines of several pages on the Web, it seems it should be possible to do this, but which module is required?  And does that prescribe the version of UNIX I'll be able to run?  Thanks in advance for any experience you can share!

Wotcher,
You'll need a UNIBUS TS11 card, I don't know the number for this but it
should be relatively easy to get hold of.  BSD2 certainly supports this.

Cheers

All,
	The following people now have SCO source licenses for ancient Unix:

Bruce Robertson, Erick Delios, Kelwin Wylie, Kirsten McIntyre, Matthew Crosby

That brings the numbering scheme up to AU-50, but in fact there are 52
SCO source licenses for ancient Unix.

The mailing list has been pretty quiet. Hope you're all well. The only
news I have is that Norman Wilson is still slowly scanning in the manuals
from 2nd to 5th Edition. He now has most (all?) of 5th edition scanned in.

I haven't heard from Kirk McKusick, but he's still planning to sell a 4CD
set of all the 4BSD releases from CSRG. The cost is still expected to be
around US$100, but if he gets flooded with requests, this may come down.

Software Tools
--------------

I got some mail last week from Deborah Scherrer:
    I was one of the people who created the Software
    Tools project and Software Tools Users Group (Peter Salus
    mentioned us in his book).  If you're interested, you might
    want to include the Software Tools tapes in your collection.

She suggested that I contact Barbera Chase, which I did.
Barbera (bc at mrdata.netcetera.com) then wrote:
    Sorry, we don't actually have any of the files online anymore, nor do we
    have access to a tape drive.  What we have are 9-track tapes, probably in
    1600bpi.  There are three versions of the tools for PDP machines, one for
    RSX-11 and two for "generic" Unix.  I still happen to have several copies
    of each, and will be glad to send them to you.  Just let me know where to
    send them, and if you happen to have a shipping account number that would
    be even better ;-)

I don't know Barbera's geographic location. However, would anybody in the
US be prepared to read these tapes for us, and pass the contents to me for
inclusion in the PUPS Archive??!

Cheers all,

	Warren

I think having these in the archives would be great.  I used the
Software Tools extensively back in the late 70's and early 80's.
I wish I could read the tapes in, but I'm still working on a tape
drive for an 11/73.  (see separate mail.)

There hasn't been much traffic here for a while, so maybe I can stir
things up a bit.

I recently acquired a fabulous 9-track tape drive, an M4 9914, which
has both a SCSI and a Pertec interface.  This drive is so smart I
spent a couple of hours playing with it without it being hooked up to
any computer.

What's nice is that I can presumably get around the "high-cost"
bottleneck of using a tape drive on both a PDP-11 and Intel
machines: use the SCSI interface on the PC where the interface is
cheap (already exists) and use the Pertec interface on the -11 where
the interface is cheap (already exists).  Using the opposite interface
on each machine could run up to a total of $2000 US.

So, what I want to do is read my PUPS archive CD-ROM on an Intel
machine and write appropriate 9-track tapes for the -11.  The stumbling
block seems to be software on the Intel side.  SCSI software packages
for MS-DOS or Windows 3.1/95/98/NT run $600, $800, even $1500US.
There must be a way of doing a CD-to-Tape generation with a simple
C-language program using one of the "free" OSes: Linux, FreeBSD,
SCO UnixWare, etc.

If anyone has any experience or ideas with this, I would appreciate
your input.  It would be very easy for me to install and use one of
these OSs on a spare 486 I have.  The question is, which is the most
likely to support SCSI on 9-track tape.

Thanks,
Dave

Sure, that's the obvious way to go.

I think you'll find that they all support SCSI.  I'd recommend FreeBSD
because I'm involved with it and because it's the closest to 2.11BSD.
Next, I'd recommend Linux, because you have the sources.  You could
have trouble with UnixWare, in which case there wouldn't be much you
could do about it.  If you do have any problems with FreeBSD, let me
know and I'll see what I can do.

Can anyone shed any light on a company called Dilog.    Having acquired two Dilog machines they appear to actually both be PDP-11s.    Dilog seemed to have produced DEC compatible hardware for the UK market.   

In particular the smaller machine was known as a Vixen.    This would appear to be a  PDP-11/73 with the DEC M8192 processor card.   Indeed the processor card is the only actual DEC product.    Colleagues that used this machine described it as the portable PDP-11 - however we are not talking laptop here :)

 The 'Vixen' has a Dilog disk controller with a Seagate ST251 attached.    The machine is currently running DSM-11 and recognises the drive as a RA81.

I hope to produce a list relating the Dilog part numbers to original DEC part numbers.

Any help or suggestions gratefully received.

Neato.... I am beginning to think it might be a fun thing to do.

As the newbie aboard, what pdp-11, vax, or other dec machine would be
one to shoot for.  Some are largish beasts, but for the Joe Homehobby
type that wants to run one in the basement, what would be a reasonable
combination of parts or units (or a whole machine) to look for?

Occasionally machines float up from the bilges here in central NC, USA,
and usually they wind up dumpster fodder.  Rather than see that happen,
if I had a choice, what should I be looking for?  For convenience, if
there was something that would fit in half a relay rack or so, that
might be nice.  Also, if it could run with standard cartridge tapes
(DC300/450/600) sized things, that would be advantageous, since I have
a number of those things and nil reel to reel drives.

That would be something worthwhile to have, just for posterity.

I just checked our folks.... nil reel-to-reel drives anymore..... shucks.
One of the technical high schools has the only one left here in NC.

p.s.  Are there any USA NC folks on the list, or just me?

Hi -

> From: Kevin Murrell <kevin at xpuppy.demon.co.uk>

	Linebreaks please?  72-80 columns would be nice ;)

> Can anyone shed any light on a company called Dilog. 

	Not sure if they're still in the DEC business but at one time they
	were one of the major 3rd party vendors making Qbus and Unibus
	controllers.

> Having acquired two Dilog machines they appear to actually both be PDP-11s.
> Dilog seemed to have produced DEC compatible hardware for the UK market.   

	I never heard of Dilog making entire systems.  You'd typically buy
	the box from DEC (but without any controllers or as few as you could
	order a system from DEC with) and then stuff it with Emulex or Dilog
	adaptors.

> In particular the smaller machine was known as a Vixen.

	Sounds like an OEM somewhere was buying bare systems from DEC and
	placing Dilog cards in them.

> This would appear to be a  PDP-11/73 with the DEC M8192 processor card.

	Indeed it is.

> Indeed the processor card is the only actual DEC product.
> Colleagues that used this machine described it as the portable PDP-11 - 
>however we are not talking laptop here :)

	What are the dimensions?  It likely is a BA-23 box.  "Transportable"
	would be appropriate - unless you've a *huge* (and sturdy) lap ;)

>  The 'Vixen' has a Dilog disk controller with a Seagate ST251 attached.

	It was/is common for controller cards to call anything over ~150mb
	an 'ra81' just to give the software a diskid it knew about.

	On the various Dilog cards you should find (either on the spine/handles
	or the card's front/back) a name.  Something like "DQ696" (a disk
	controller) or "DQ132" (tape controller).  If you can find any numbers
	at all let us know and we can probably id them for you.

As Steven Schultz says, Dilog used to make a lot of DEC-compatible
peripheral gear.  The old company has been gone for years, but there
is a descendant in Switzerland; see http://www.dilog.ch for details
and contacts.  There are still people there who can dig up info about
old Dilog Qbus interfaces; I have discovered this empirically.
Perhaps they know about the Vixen box; certainly they can likely
find out about the Dilog disk controller.

   I don't know if it's their only business, but they still sell (and
hopefully make) these controllers. One of their guys was trying to sell me
one just a few months ago. Of course, their prices are way off-base
compared to the used market.

Hi Jim, I'll pass this email on to the mailing list. I'll probably take you

On a similar bent, I have been working on roffing Dennis' V1 manuals,
using the earliest roff I could still find some sort of source to.
It is one that was popular in the early CP/M days, that also found
its way into dos and unix.  How true to the original it is, I dunno,
but it works.  They are about 2/3 done, maybe, but my time to get them
done is not as much as I would like.

What should I do with them once they are done?  I was thinking of just
sending the source/output back to Dennis, but if it is OK to put them in
in the PUPS archives, I can bounce them to Warren.

Thanks to Dennis Ritchie for making them available.

Bob Keys

p.s.  You know, with all this html thingie, whatever happened to just
      a real roff/nroff/troff output?  It is only ascii.  Why html?
      Just curious as to why/wherefore/etc.

I hadn't expected Warren to forward my note directly to the list,
so perhaps I'd better fill in some of the missing content.

What I'm trying to do with the old manuals is a mix of different
sorts of historic preservation: it's interesting to be able to
produce something reasonably close to the original in appearance,
including style differences, but I am also interested just in
making the content accessible.  That means being able to render
the manual pages into troff -man on modern UNIX systems, or into
nroff /man/man0/naa in the V5 root image, and roff and whatnot;
but also into HTML because that's the right way to make text
available on the web (Postscript is not text), and certainly into
other forms I haven't thought of yet.

To describe it all in utterly pragmatic terms, I want to be able
to put all the old manuals up on the web somewhere in readable
text form (not just page images or Postscript); and to produce
manual data of authentic content and reasonably authentic style
for use with the V5 binary distribution; and to be able to to
print clear reference copies for myself, so I can pack my old
photocopies away in a safe place; and to amuse myself by running
style and diction on the different editions; and I want to be
able to do that even if I don't have a copy of roff or the
appropriate age-authentic macro package.

So the idea is to mark up the text in a sufficiently high-level
form that it can be rendered into any of the forms above (including
the ones I haven't thought of) without undo work.  I thought briefly
about using the (V7-era) -man macros as the high-level language,
and in fact much of the simple language I ended up inventing are
obviously drawn from -man (e.g. there are constructs that are
exactly .TH, .SH, and .SS spelled differently); but I wanted to
avoid the temptation just to toss in more and more troff-specific
syntax and semantics whenever some hard-to-represent construct
popped up.  (There are too many low-level constructs in the resulting
language as it is.)  I also thought about using some existing
document metalanguage like XML or YODL, but those I looked at
were far more ornate than seemed appropriate, and far too free-form;
I don't mind carrying a few medium-sized awk programs around to
render the text, but I object to having to port a language-processing
subsystem larger than the V5 kernel just so I can render V5's manual
pages.  (Never mind how large awk and troff are these days.)

There's a name I should also name here: my collaborator in California
to whom the earlier message alludes is Jennine Townsend, who has
photocopies of my photocopies from a sort of earlier collaboration.

More on this in a few days; as I said to Warren, I hope to get
a coherent sample of all this work up on the web shortly so people
can see what I'm doing in more detail and comment, but I am in
the midst of deciding whether to change jobs (it is a coincidence
that the likely job change would put me nearer the OCR setup I've
been using, but it is convenient), and in getting back into the
swing of things at my present job after being out for two weeks
to recover from having corrective maintenance on my sinuses, so
it may not happen till the weekend.

A postscript to my note on the old manuyals (typed into the
editor but not written out before I sent the mail!):

A note on distributing this stuff: I asked Dennis about it before
I started my project, and he thought there should be no real
problem making the text generally available, but that it would
be appropriate for the official repository to be at Bell Labs
(now a once-again-visible subsidiary of Lucent Technologies).
That seems pretty sensible to me.  I doubt there's a problem
putting them in the PUPS archive, but it would be politic to
check with Dennis first.

Hi all,
	Not much has been hapenning in the PDP UNIX Preservation Society.
Kirk McKusick is still waiting for the CD pressing company to do his run
of 4BSD CDs. I'm urging him to make a web page describing the project, so
we can stay informed of the progress.

A few people in comp.unix.bsd.misc suggested that another preservation
society needs to be formed, to preserve 32-bit UNIXes and other non PDP-11
UNIXes. I've set up a mailing list for them to discuss such a project.
If you are interested, then you can join the mailing list by emailing
to majordomo at minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au, with a line in the body saying:

	subscribe bups

BUPS stands for BIG UNIX Preservation Society. I'm sure they will come
up with a better name :-)

Cheers all,

	Warren

This will be great when it happens.  Kudos to Kirk.....and all the unsung

PUPS, BUPS, burp!  Sounds fine!

I will jump in the hotseat and own up to the heat.  My idea was very simple.
Mainly, I was thinking that there are beginning to surface from the bilges
of surplus, a fair number of aging old-time unix toys.  Not all of them
are PDP-11ish flavor.  For instance, there are sometimes found some of the
ancient Radio Shack Model 16 things with an odd flavor of Xenix on them.
There are maybe some old vaxen going wanting.  There are odd bilgewater
sloshers like my old IBM RT that once did ply the waters of the great BSD
(of the 4.3 style flavor).  Also, there are older x86 toys that use to
run the very lowendian V7ish, Xenixish, whateverish flavors.  From the
purely hobby and historical perspective, I find it rather wasteful to
let such things just vaporize.  It seems we have the PDP11 world, then
there is a big black hole until the modern SCOish and Freebieish things.
It is obvious that none of the old toys are going to be competing with
the rush to NT and SCOish things.  Thus, there is a need to maybe fill
that hole with something like the PUPS, but for 32bitish toys, and all
the non-PDP-11 toys.

One thing that PUPS has going, is a good working basis with all the
unixy world, the big players, the historical saints, etc.  So, it was
logical to perceive that such a working framework might be expanded
slightly to include not just 32V, but all the odd successors, down to
where SCO claims rightly its territory on the SysV part of the tree.

IF that framework is a BUPS offshoot, so-be-it.  But, I still think that
both PUPS and the new BUPS share much common cammaraderie and playground.

Alas, I am not yet of sufficient rank to be called but a lowly journeyman,
in the unixy world.  I have run it in earnest for some 10 years, played 
some with it on a PDP-11, so long ago, that it is mostly forgotten, and
still keep a set of 8 inch Xenix floppers around, just in case that mystical
Model 16B drops by, again.  Thus, there is not a lot I can do.  But, I do toss
out the idea, would like to see where it goes.  Mebbie some heavyweight
gurus would like to run with it some.....

Let us roll it around a bit, and see where the currents takes us.
The 32BitBiggieUPS should not be forgotten.  I think it can only be good
for all to make it play.....

Sincerely

R.D. Keys

   Excuse me, sir, but I have to make a point here. They _ARE_ competing!
My office is the largest room in the department, and it's filled with VAXen
of all kinds. My goal is to get 4.3BSD-* running on all of them and operate
this system in direct competition with other UNIX systems on our campus,
which are all Pentiums or SPARCs. Since my system administration skills and
friendliness to students surpass those of other campus UNIX systems' admins
by many orders of binary magnitude, I plan to urge people to migrate to my
VAXen this way. Yes, my plan is total world VAX domination! This is exactly
why I want to modify Berkeley VAX UNIX to run on all VAX models from 11/780
to 10000. (An EXTREMELY daring and ambitious goal, needless to say.)
   
   I have two strong and radical views:
   
   0. The only higher-than-PDP-11 computers that can be allowed to run UNIX
are DEC VAXen. I oppose the idea of running UNIX on PeeCees and shit like
that.
   
   1. I consider it the ultimate in blasphemy to attempt to create "UNIX
clones" that people dare to call "Unix" but don't really contain any code
written by God Ritchie, God Thompson, or God Kernighan. I never use any
"free Unices" like FreeBSD and NetBSD. Right now I use Ultrix and SunOS,
which are kosher in the above sense but binary-only for most people. The
latter part is why I want to move to 4.3BSD-*. Also my belief in True
licensed UNIX(R) is the reason I have joined PUPS, as it seems to be the
only remaining group dealing with such UNIX.

That is also wrong, as Interdata 8/32, IBM System/370 and Honeywell 6000

It was God Bell Labs (nee WE) that K&R worked for that put the odious 
license fees on unix, in 1980 it was a mere $24,000 for the sources which 
were a must have.  People started doing clones to break free of the 
license and distributions that didn't contain sources.  It made possible 
to get on platforms that were unsupported/unsupportable without source 
code or at least for the commercial versions at lower cost to the user.  
Venix for Pro350 is such an example (it's v6 or v7 code!).  I'm not 
saying the clones are good or bad, only born of necessity.  Of course 
they couldn't contain and of said God code due to licenses.

Like all gods their feet are of clay.

Since the goal is to preserve unix and unix like OSs there is no crime,
even if the varients are not direct decendents.  So long as people 
understand the lineage preservation should certainly should proceed.

No excuses necessary.  But, please relax a bit and don't let the blood
boil to much.  All of us here, are interested in the preservation of the
beast.  Granted many may run it for a living, me included, to some extent.
But, likewise most or many of us are the same folks that have a vaxen
or pdp-11 in the basement (I remember seeing a pix of one of our leader's
machines next to the kitchen fridge?).  Clearly, the basement/kitchen toys
are not competing.  They are purely hobby related.  My dumpster risc box
won't ever compete again, but is fun to spin up a TeX and troff on.

Clearly yours are more mainstream related.  

Kudos for the sysadmin handholding towards the students.  Mentoring, one
on one is the best way to handle many computer learning things.

Although vaxen may dominate the world (or did at one time, according to
Henry Spencer's infamous ten commandments for C programmers), there are
many lesser breeds that I sense others of us partake of.  Also, there
are insufficient numbers of remaining vaxen and pdp-11's for all of us
to have one in the home hobbyroom.  Because of that, I would suggest
that maybe there is interest in the other lines of machines and their
related unices, even the 32bitters.

Not so, IMHO.  The purist may run a vaxen in the manner of the Bugattis
of old, but us garage monkeywrench types may be stuck with even a lowly
PC thingie.  Don't quite put the PC flavors down, since I can attest to
their utility in poverty stricken research projects for at least the past
10 years, courtesy Big Blue and that hybrid PC unix of theirs (AIX 1.x).
Also, the freebie BSD's are sufficiently close to the real thing, that
most average users would not know the difference.  Cat is cat is cat,
no matter how it is coded (and they all look remarkably similar).

Well, yes and no.

I consider it a tribute to the likes of Thompson, Ritchie, Kernighan,
Ossanna, and a string of others down the trees, that the wisdom of their
reasoning and toiling has had fruition even in the lowly PC's.  Why did
the freebies catch on like they have?  Because the folks wanted something
like a BSD, and the corporate bean counters and lawyers missed their chance.
As to which flavor to use, I use what I have that will run on whichever
box I have on.  I prefer a BSDish box, but even a V7 is fun, and with
a viish terminal driver and troff, still runs with the best of the big
dogs, and even AIX is usable if you get used to its quirks.

But, for sure, the point of all this is to preserve the history, code,
nuances, and whatever else can be maintained, unless I am sorely amiss
of the PUPS goals.  I only think it needs to include the castoff 32
bit machines, too, hence the need for a BUPS group, IMHO.

Can anyone refresh my memory of what machines specifically were listed
in the V7 and 32V and 2/3/4BSD docs?  I would like to get that clear,
for reference purposes.  Also, what specific machines were ported out
of these main sources by the odd vendors.  The majority was pdp11ish,
but about V7 time the 68000 and Z8000 and other oddities pop up.

I would agree on the necessity.  Back in '88 I went shopping for an office
machine, and could find nothing under around 25 kilobucks.  I opted out
for a peanuts budget machine (PS/2 model 80 with AIX) at around 10K bucks
and the silly thing is still whirring away as my remote tape dumper.
Alas, it is a much maligned PC, but it functions nontheless, and IS a
real unix.  Alas, these days, its steam is a little underpowered trying
to scrape the web, so it idles in the background.  Technically, it is
a 32 bit abandoned unix, and for hypotheticals, it ought to be something
workable in a BUPS sort of archive, with proper Big Blue nodding.  The
same thing should occur for the RT.  It would probably be a nightmare
of paperwork between SCO and IBM and us, tho.....

The gods were hacking away fine.... alas the beanyheads upstairs had

The goal is to save it if possible, BEFORE it becomes vaporware, for
purely hobby/historical purposes, with the big player's graces and
consents.

If we don't dream a little and oil some squeeky wheels, it will never
get done.....

I'm glad there are people and codebases that compete with Microsoft -- and I work for Microsoft.  It keeps us on our toes.  :-)  I run NT 4.0 and Linux 2.0.30 side-by-side at home, on the selfsame network -- and all on Intel hardware.  I am on this mailing list because I am gaining a PDP 11/34 as a new resident in my home, which will be networked together with the Intel hardware (so I don't have to run downstairs all the time -- the PDP is too large for my computer room upstairs).  Why?  Call it a sense of history....

Why shouldn't UNIX run on everything?  The beauty of the UNIX idea -- which has been cloned and transported and transliterated and transmogrified a myriad times a myriad times -- is that it expresses a rich metaphor for computation, which allows us to make use of these metal monsters.  I have the greatest respect for "true" UNIX and its parents and godparents.  I also have a lot of respect for Linus Torvalds and the incredible piece of work he birthed -- a true UNIX version that makes excellent use of the PC architecture.  

The PC architecture has commoditized significant computing power in a manner that Digital could never have done (or at least, never did), and placed that into the hands of many people who would be otherwise financially barred from playing this game.  IMHO it's specious to demonize a particular machine architecture and declare that UNIXes running on it are somehow illegitimate.  

Cheers -- Ian King

NOTE:  this is strictly my personal ramblings, and does not in any way represent the official position of the Microsoft Corporation.

I don't know, I thought that it would give people more flexibility,
and shield people from stuff they didn't want to see. So lets ask:

If you're on the PUPS list, do you want to see stuff about non PDP-11 Unixes?

If you're on the BUPS list, do you want to see stuff about PDP-11 Unixes.

Cheers all,

I vote for one list.  Leave it PUPS, and call it the
Past/Prehistoric/Perpetual Unix Preservation Society
or something like that.  Or think up a "P" adjective
that glorifies the olden Unix.

Almost everything has been cross-posted up to this point,
and I get two copies anyway!

Looks like most people would like a common list, so I have merged the
two lists. The PUPS list is now for Prehistoric UNIX :-) I'll keep the
PUPS web page about PDP-11 stuff for now, though.

The bups at minnie list is gone, and all mail for the list should
now go to pups at minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au.

What next?

Yes!

Yes!

Personally, I think it's a bad idea to have two separate societies/lists. After
all, in many case PDP-11 UNIX and VAX UNIX are the same code compiled for
different CPUs, and these lists are not about binary-only OSes, are they?

If it's all fundamentally the same code, it should be on one list, regardless
of what CPUs people want to compile it for.

I'm also a little troubled by the word "preservation". This word suggests the
group acknowledges that these systems are "old" or "historical". 4.3BSD is
being _ACTIVELY WORKED ON_ (by me) as I type, and I have been under the
impression that 2.11BSD is also being actively worked on by Steven M. Schults.
Sure, these systems WILL be "old" or "historical" if we just sit and "preserve"
them, but IMHO this is NOT what we should do. We should look and act and behave
AS IF these systems were brand new. I.e, run them in production on the net
competing with Pentiums and SPARCs, and actually MAKE thse systems new by doing
active development work on the sources just like the dev teams for "new" OSes
do. If we can't build a time machine, let's shut all doors and windows and
create a 1980s world inside!

So, with these ideas in mind, why not call ourselves TUUDS, True UNIX User and
Developer Society?

Absolutely right! The only problem with it that old CPUs are
seems to be slowly vaporizing... I spent about ten years searching
until I finally got original Digital PDP-11 here in Uzbekistan (xUSSR) !
And I succeeded only because I started working for Digital here.

I'm on both, I'm interested in stuff about both.  I would have thought
that the overlap is fairly large.

They never stopped making them.  Mentec has some really fast 11s.

Mike, take a prozac and chill.  It's all that capitalism that is making 
all of those old PDP-11s and such available in the first place.  This 
place is for unix and it's heirs and relations not political ranting.
We can argue better, first, cleanest, purity after we have captured the 
code and preserved it from loss.

Fellow PUPS Listers,
could someone with the proper education please look at Soko's postings
here and in Netbsd vax list and tell me if soko is a real person or if
he is an agitation program done by the psychology department?
Thanks

I agree with the idea of one list, but prefer the original
PDP11 Unix Preservation Society. My interest is mainly PDP11 
and Unix, which the name suggests. Linked together the names also
provide an indication of the historical nature of the systems being 
used. I think anyone with an interest in only one of the two aspects
should be welcome in the group, and I am interested in their 
questions or comments about their system. 

I also suspect that most participants in the mailing list are 
using PDP11 computers. If I didn't have an 11, but was still
using a Model 16 from Radio Shack I personally would not feel
unwelcome in this group with the original name retained. If 
other people do feel the PDP11 part of the name excludes them
perhaps a name change would be appropriate.

My office is full of VAXen, but I don't envision a PDP-11 coming in any time
soon.

Yes. Keep in mind that starting with 32V and 3BSD all cool and exciting
development of True UNIX we're talking about here has been on VAXen, NOT on
PDP-11s. Also almost all versions of VAX UNIX (I feel that 4.2BSD+ qualifies as
"almost all") are networking, while PDP-11 UNIX (OK, with the exception of
2.11BSD) is not. You can't seriously expect a UNIXed PDP-11 do what people
would normally expect a UNIX box to do. You CAN do this with a VAX (I'm the
living proof). So, that "PDP-11" stuck in there is very insulting, implicitly
suggesting that anyone who actually runs UNIX(R) in full production for
thousands of users, rather than just "preserves" it, is an outcast. The same
for the word "Preservation". Why not call it Proper UNIX Patriot Society?

No, and my original thought was to fold it all under PUPS, but, I sense
that Warren was not wanting to do that.

For heaven's sakes, let us roll with the flow, and do what is best for
all aboard.  If that is one list, fine.... or two lists, fine.
It was just a thought.....

I would just like to see other orphan unices included in the philosophy
behind PUPS, before they go vaporware, forever.

How it gets there is unimportant, and for sure we don't want any politics
or bent feelers involved.

It is more important that we get it done, however it happens to get there.

For the sake of discussion.....

What should one look for in a VAX?

Say I was walking along through our state surplus agency (and I do that
regularly these days, since all kinds of neato unicy goodies are popping
up from a lot of folks going to NT toys), what kind of parts and pieces
would I need to put together a minimal VAX, suited to some flavor of
homegrown 32V/3BSD/4BSD, etc.

Some of us would not really know one if it fell over on us.... like me.
Yet, IFF I knew enough of what to look out for, mebbie one might appear.
Everyone around here wants plain PC parts and machines in surplus, so
the rest usually gets dumpster chucked or hauled off for scrap by the
pallet load.  I just missed 3 relay racks full of such things as
9 track tape drives, and some sort of pdpish lookalike things.

So, what parts by name and number should I keep an eye out for, so
that enough of something might be cobbled together to work?

I have lots of experiences on PS/2, RT, and x86 unix boxes, but
am woefully short on pdp-11 and VAXen experiences.  I played with
a pdp-11 many years ago, but I did not know much then.  I am probably
not the only one.....

As ol' number 5 was want to say......``need input.... need input''

Thanks

Yes please.  Two reasons.  The first is that I have a general interest
as I guess most of us have.  The second is that I am interested in
porting stuff onto 2.11 and if something comes up on the other unixes it
may have an app on a pdp one

   Basically, you need a box that says "VAX" on it. :-) Now, there are all
kinds of different VAXen. If you want one that's capable of running
something other than VMS, you have to be really careful. 32V, 3BSD, and
4.0BSD run on the original VAX-11/780 ONLY. There is a VERY low probability
of you (or me) ever finding one. 4.1BSD and 4.2BSD extend this to 11/750
and 11/730, respectively, but these are still very big and scarce beasts.
If you are a REAL VAX patriot (one for whom VAXen are the ONLY computers),
none of this should matter to you anyway, since versions of UNIX before
4.3BSD are unfit for production use on ARPA Internet (the ones before
4.2BSD lack any networking whatsoever, and 4.2BSD lacks DNS).
   
   If your OS of choice is 4.3BSD, 4.3BSD-Tahoe, or 4.3BSD-Reno, you are in
a much better shape. All of them have kernel support for MicroVAX II, and
Reno (and possibly Tahoe) has support for MicroVAX III. It's still very
rudimentary, though. I personally haven't been able to get it booted yet!
Seeing how much work remains to be done to get Berkeley UNIX running on
MicroVAXen, I have decided to take a crack at it myself. I am actively
working on extending the VAX hardware support in 4.3BSD to MicroVAXen and
everything else not currently supported. My goal is to support everything
from 11/780 to 10000. Total world VAX domination!
   
   This is very long-term, though, and you probably want something sooner.
When I was faced with a pressing need to get one of my VAXen up and running
in May, my solution was (and still is) to run Ultrix. True, not having the
sources is VERY frustrating, and some DECisms like subsets, setld,
BIND/Hesiod, etc. really piss me off, but presently this is the closest you
can get to True VAX UNIX(R) that runs on something you or I can get our
hands on. (A note for those who subscribe both to this list and to
port-vax at netbsd.org. PLEASE don't advertise your freebie toy here.
Fortunately, this list is for LICENSED UNIX(R).)
   
   If you want to assemble your VAX from parts, first realize that some of
them (BabyVAXen in my terminology) consist of a single system board. On the
other end of the spectrum there are huge beasts. Although they do consist
of a myriad of boards, they are so specialized that you are very unlikely
to ever find a board for one laying separately. The only VAXen that one can
realistically build from parts are Q-bus ones. To build one, you need a Q-
bus enclosure with a Q22-bus backplane, a Q-bus VAX CPU (KA6xx), and,
unless your CPU has on-board Ethernet and DSSI, Q-bus disk and tape
controllers and a Q-bus Ethernet interface (DEQNA or DELQA). Of course, you
also need the disk and tape drives themselves.
   
   Good luck!

Hmm. Looks like we need a larger umbrella group which caters for the
preservation, use and development of all Unix varieties past and present.
I nominate the name   The Unix Society

Such a society could have chapters which focus on particular things like
Vax Unixes, PDP-11 Unixes etc., but share common high-level goals.

While I disagree with Michael's idea of total world domination by Vaxen :-),
I believe such a society will be composed of a multitude of different beliefs,
ideas, sub-goals and drives. So please bear this in mind when mailing to the
mailing list!!!

My main sub-goal is to provide a home for the PDP-11 stuff. I don't yet
have the disk space for all the other Unix platforms. Mail yesterday from
Kirk McKusick says that the 4-CD BSD set should be ready within a matter of
days.

Comments on the suggestion of `The Unix Society' as a name? I'm avoiding
using UNIX as it's a trademark, and it's an adjective.

At least over here, the vax that `everyone' had was an 11/750, which
is one reasonably-sized-but-very-heavy cabinet, with the CPU &c, and
usually tape & disk in one or more other boxes.  These things run 4.2
& 4.3 (and earlier I'm sure), and are a bit more tractable than the
11/780 (but slower).  I'd guess that these things should be still
available in large numbers, but maybe they've all been scrapped by
now.  There are many faster & smaller ones, but I always figured that
the 750 & 780 were the most proper vaxen...

I don't see the difference in case between UNIX and Unix as
significant in defining what part of speech it means, and we've
already discovered that lawyers prefer UNIX, but will accept Unix if
they want to make a case about violating the conditions of use of the
name.  I find the spelling "Unix" looks like the kind of mistake that
people make when they're not aware of these niceties, so I'd prefer
not to use it.

More generally, though, there's nothing in the name that suggests
anything to do with the history of the system.  For all it says to the
outside world, it's a new competitor to USENIX.

OK, PUPS may be wearing thin, and I wasn't really serious with OUPS (I
tried, unsuccesfully, to find an expansion for OOPS), but I think we
need to look a little further if we want to change the name.

Hmm, I don't like the all-caps UNIX, looks ugly. This is probably a taste
thing. I wanted to avoid the word `preservation', as people like Steven, 
Michael and others are still maintaining, using and developing these systems.

We need a sub-committee to come up with a new name :-) My next suggestion is
/The UNIX Heritage Society/i

Sounds a lot better.  Time for some other comments, when the rest of
the world wakes up.

   Oh, I'm not saying that VAXen should dominate the mailing list or the
society, I'm simply saying that my project is to turn them from
"retrocomputing" into a fully competitive UNIX platform.

   Keep in mind, though, that the UNIX(R) mainstream is PDP-11 _AND_ VAX.

   I personally think it's a very bad idea to extend the society to cover
freebies. Let's keep it limited to software that requires an SCO or
equivalent license. Why? Because otherwise it loses its identity. You can't
cover all UNIX and "Unix" in the world. Huge organizations like USENIX
already exist for this purpose. I believe the purpose of the society should
be to provide a home for the homeless. Here is what I mean by that. People
using "free Unices" already have scores of mailing lists and newsgroups
available to them. The only ones who are always left out are the poor
patriots of True Licensed UNIX(R). So far PUPS has been the only possible
home for them.
   
   Why not have a Proper UNIX(R) Patriot Society which will do the same
thing PUPS does now (provide a central clearinghouse for all licensed
UNIX(R), keep the central database of SCO license holders, discuss
licensing issues), but without restricting it to PDP-11s or to mere
preservation? I don't think we need a huge society with chapters and
subchapters to cover every possible use of every possible OS. People who
want to use a particular OS in a particular way should have their own
mailing lists to discuss really specific issues like hardware, etc. That's
what I will do for 4.3BSD-Quasijarus when it actually sees the light of
day. (For now it has a closed consortium. My experience has been that in
such early stages of development keeping discussions on a public list leads
to nothing except accusations of "vaporware" and flame wars.) PUPS should
be a central clearinghouse for licensed UNIX(R), nothing more. Its scope
should be exactly equal to the scope of the SCO license.
   
   Just my two bits.

   Michael Sokolov

I think he has a point here:

  Restrict it to whatever the Ancient Unix license from SCO
  (and any equivalent licenses yet to emerge) covers.  In fact,
  an objective could be to try to ADD more systems from vendors
  (like Venix, even Xenix) who required the AT&T license.

If this is the case, the "Preservation" part of PUPS is OK, since
what we are trying to do is preserve the use of this strain of
system software.

As to the first P, if not PDP(-11), then what it should refer to
is the original strain of Unix--the Primordial Unix.  Hence:

Primordial Unix Preservation Society.

(I really don't want to change my "pups" email alias!)

That's rather conservative, isn't it?  If we had done that previously,
there would never now have been an SCO licence for 16 bit UNIX.  If we
do it now, there will never be a license for 32 bit UNIX.

Keep it to systems which require a UNIX source license, then?

Awake! I fully agree with all of Greg's statements. Btw. the original way of
writing UNIX was actually unix. Small caps. Of course, using troff you could
take advantage of scaling fonts and say \s-2UNIX\s+2. I'm not sure about the
feeling of dmr and colleagues with respect to UNIX, but I remember him having
a heavy disrespect for STREAMS as compared to streams. The thing is that with
email when saying STREAMS you actually shout, which non of us intend to.

I don't think I'm saying what you think I said?  I not trying to
restrict it to nothing, or even not 32-bit.

But then it's Sunday night here, and Monday morning there, so maybe
I'm not clear about what I said!?

OK.  The current SCO license is limited specifically to 16 bis
systems.  We'd like to get, say, System V as well.

After negotiating with SCO, I can safely say that they won't make System V
cheaply available for any system, yet. Heck, they wouldn't even let us have
the crippled System V for the PDP-11.

You might be lucky to get System III added to the source license, and separate
binary-only licenses for certain System V systems. That's another battle, tho.

Yet.  What did the situation look like for the Seventh Edition 5 years
ago?

Sure.  I was just saying we shouldn't accept the status quo, not that
we should go tilting at windmills.

   It is absolutely crucial, since it emphasizes that we are talking about
the one single system named UNIX, rather than any of its teenage "free"
clones.

   No, no, PLEASE get rid of that "preservation" stigma. It's like a brand
on a slave, a constant reminder of limits and constraints. Terms like
"preservation", "historical", "heritage", "primordial", "ancient", etc. all
suggest something of purely historical value. This is EXTREMELY insulting
to those of us for whom True UNIX(R) is the ONLY multiuser operating
system.

   Excuse me, sir, I have to make a point here. The SCO license _DOES_
cover 32-bit UNIX(R), namely 32V! 32V is the first version of UNIX for 32-
bit machines aka VAXen, and it's the mother of EVERYTHING known today as
West Coast UNIX, from 3BSD to the freebies, whether for VAXen or other 32-
bit CPUs.
   
   As I have said all along, PUPS's pre-hung-up'ness on PDP-11s has been
the source of a lot of grief for us the VAX lovers. It is the reason why
SCO's license talks so much about PDP-11s and the reason I have had so much
trouble obtaining the software I need, since everyone believes that the SCO
license is limited to 16-bit toys. Of course it is not, and in fact it is
the reason why Marshall Kirk McKusick is releasing the CD-ROMs with CSRG's
code (80% of which is 32-bit), but thanks to PUPS's pre-hung-up'ness on
PDP-11s, try to explain this to people!
   
   Thanks Daemon the gang is finally beginning to realize that UNIX(R) runs
on more than just PDP-11s.

I agree that we should continue to lobby SCO, and more importantly so now
that we have a foothold. I'm just pointing out the current `reality', but
I'm sure it will change over time.

If having a source license was a requirement for the systems we cover,
then I'd say this was pretty reasonable.

I'd just like to comment on Michael's e-mail, just for the record. The PDP-11
UNIX Preservation Society was, at one point, just me. I'd had help from
Steven Schultz, Tim Shoppa, John Wilson and Torsten Hippe, and my personal
goal was to get copies of 6th and 7th Edition Unix, for historical reasons.
Since then, people with similar interests have accumulated. We've set up a
mailing list, web page etc.

Steven and I took months to lobby SCO to make source licenses available. We
started in late '95/early '96. Again, we were driven by our own personal goals
of making cheap licenses for PDP-11 UNIXes available. We were also guided
by the web-based survey, see http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/PUPS/pdpquiz_sum.html,
which showed an awful lot more interest for PDP-11 UNIXes than 32-bit UNIXes.

Yes, PUPS has been hung up on PDP-11s. There's no denying that. It's a result
of the personal drives that Steven, I, and the other active members of the
mailing list have. If we have caused grief to the VAX users, it was
unintentional. 

The license that we negotiated with SCO was based as much on our personal
goals as on pragmatics. During the negotiations, it became apparent that:

	+ There was a substantial bloc at SCO who didn't want ANY license
	+ For the rest, Research Editions 1 to 7 was ok
	+ 32V was dubious: most people didn't want this licensed
	+ System III was also dubious
	+ System V was definitely right out: nobody wanted this licensed

The fact that we got 32V on the SCO license was, in my opinion, damn lucky,
even though I pushed and pushed and pushed for this to be included. SCO,
for their part, probably feel that they have limited the `damage' by only
licensing the 16-bit systems, and 32V (grudgingly).

Now why was I pushing 32V so hard? Because I knew it would open the path
for CSRG to release the BSD flavours. This is the ONLY reason why I fought
so hard for it to be included in the license.


Hopefully this has filled in some of the background on the behind-the-scenes
work. I agree that, up to now, the effort has concentrated on the 16-bit
systems. I knew that, by getting 32V into the license, it would give scope
for the 32-bit systems. At the same time, there was NO WAY that SCO would
have licensed any other 32-bit system. The license we have reflects SCO's
legal concerns as much as the negotiators' PDP preference.


However, 32V is licensed, and Kirk will be selling the CRSG BSD releases
on a 4-CD set next week. A fair proportion of PDP-11 UNIX history has been
saved. Now it's time for those with a preference for other systems to
extend what has been achieved. Go for it!

Heritage means: that which may be inherited. I think this is appropriate,
as we have all inherited a wonderful system from Ken and Dennis. In fact,
we've inherited the UNIX paradigm, which influences the way we think.

My dictionary says a patriot is one who is zealous for his country's
freedom or rights, and a zealot is an uncompromising or extreme partisan
or fanatic.

I would also have a problem being a "Patriot". If I was uncompromising,
we would have no cheap SCO license. I don't think we need to retro-fit a
name into the PUPS acronym.

I'm still in favour of The UNIX Heritage Society.

For those unaccustomed to the amount of traffic on the PUPS list,
don't forget that you can switch to the digest version.

Last time I met Greg he was still able to read, although he needs glasses already.
I think that his glasses actually do a very good job since he was figuring that
the license explicitely blocks access to System V and friends (Please read your own
email again).

The thing is that there are people out there who really enjoy the PDP-11 as a smart
machine. Those people presumably have written code for this machine in assembler.
Another group of people is interested in the early roots of unix. The PDP-11 in
that case serves as a host for this interest. But the historic interest does not
stop at the hardware of the PDP-11, it is rather an interest in the full life cycle
of the OS. 32V, while important, is really a hack rather than a 32bit port of the
UNIX or BSD operating system. Those people who make statements about 32bit UNIX not
being available are very likely aware of this fact, either because they where there
at the time this happend, or, like myself, have devoured every interesting UNIX book
around and have also come across Peter H. Salus' A quater century of UNIX. You might
find it interesting to read, too.

With respect to PUPS I do understand that we are interested in the history of UNIX
and that the term Warren coined fits exactly our idea. There is nothing wrong with
renaming PUPS but leave the email alias as it is. Those interested in the history
of the society (we are getting recursive on history by now) can read on the Web Page
that we originally dealt with the Preservation of the PDP-11 UNIX only.

	Joerg

I seem to recall a direct quote of either Thompson or Ritchie saying that
they'd intended to use the name "Unix" instead of "UNIX" but that is what
the OS was trademarked with by the Bell Labs lawyers.  It may have been on
one of their personal web pages that I read it.

Heritiage is generally historical in context be it previous or present

Preservation in teh case of PDP-11 (and otehr 16bit) was needed or it may 
have been lost.  One assumes the license grantors actually have complete 
sources.  In the case of at least on other OS they had the license but 
little of the code.

True.

The key here is there are two types of OSs, retired(not commercially 
viable or no support) and those that have commercial value.  

Let us not forget Mike is trying to develop a commercially viable OS 
that is not free or shareware.

Also by and large Mike is in the process of doing what other call 
archeology.  One must resore and understand the structure before building
upon it.

The patriot stuff, pure poof.

Do any of us really want SysV?  One can get that in a free license for unixware
or such, as it is, if I am understanding things correctly.

Gee, I sense I have stirred up a wee bit of a hornets nest.  For the sake of
discussion, maybe that is good.

What I had originally thought was that it might be possible to include under
the PUPS banner (or whatever it is to be called {PUPS is fine to me}), to
include orphan unices.  Let me suggest that what I mean by orphan unices is
a flavor of unix in binary or source that is essentially commercially past
history.  That would specifically be to keep from camping on SCO's income.
What might be considered an orphan unix?  One might consider things like
the BSD tree to be orphan, as it relates to non-commercial use (one would
consider BSDI commercial, but most of the others non-commercial maybe).
One might consider something like Coherent to be non-commercial anymore.
Although that is not a ``true'' unix, it sure looks and feels the same
and quacks very much like a V7 or early SysV.  Xenix falls into the same
quacks like a duck category.  Although Xenix is still used commercially,
it may be be time to begin to consider that we might, in due time, aproach
SCO to offer a hobby style Xenix license of some sort.  I would not expect
them to offer source, although that might be workable after time.  One might
consider the old RT and PS/2 unices (AOS and AIX 1 and 2) to be orphanware.
I am sure there are others.  Perhaps even the 3Bx kind of thing could be
suitably binary hobby licensed.  I would have a hard time imagining that
SCO would consider the old ATT boxes any sort of a moneymaker these days.
Where SCO would feel that we are too close to home, then maybe only a
binary license of some sort would be all that we could collectively expect.
What about something like 386BSD?  That began in the 4.3BSD era if I am
reading things corectly, and it sure walks and quacks like the real thing.
These kinds of things, I would think, are of merit to keep archives of,
for the purposes and goals that we collectively seem be be heading towards.

Is this reasonable?

Just thinking out loud.....

If nothing else, the discussion is good.....

This is a most interesting point, and one we all need to consider.

I will interpret from Allison's remarks that CP/M may be being referred
to here.  In that case, it was mostly all lost sources, and only a little
was found (and a lot of leftovers kept by the early hacker types).  It would
NOT have been possible to recreate or resurrect it without such help.

The one thing that I have noted in the 28 years I have played with computers
(only the last 20 seriously), is that sources tend to get very lost in the
passage of time.  Alas, if you try to recreate or resurrect the old early
boxes, you are lost without the tidbits of sources, binaries,  and OS notes
that seem to be all to vaporware, anymore.  So much of it is NOT kept around
by the companies.  And, many of the companies are bellyup, or have passed
through so many hands, that the original materials are long forgotten or
gone.

Somehow, we need to collectively keep enough of the bits and pieces so
that down the road, others may be able to see what it was actually all
about.  I heartily applaud the efforts of all the various groups like
the PUPS, and the efforts of folks like Warren and Kirk to keep the
unix flavors alive.
 
> The key here is there are two types of OSs, retired(not commercially

I would expect that our collective interests center on the former,
even though some/many of us may dabble in it commercially/professionally.

Sure, try writing a driver or some stuff that involves kernel variables - and you
are stuck. Actually, this reminds me that Sun did a large buy-out for System V and
the procedure for getting Solaris kernel sources has become dramatically more easy.
They might still send it to you for a nominal fee (last time DM 4,600), as long as
you use it for non-commercial purposes (e.g. universities, research institutes).

Anybody more detailed information on this ?

You don't get the source with UnixWare.  And yes, I can conceive that
the sources of old versions of System V could be of interest, if only
for the computer etymologist.  I have a Tandem LXN (68020 based SMP
machine, about 11 years old) which ran an interesting version of
System V.2 and V.3.0.  While I was still at Tandem, I backed up the
last versions of the source (in Austin TX), and unfortunately I didn't
discover that the backup failed until I got back to Germany.  AFAIK
the sources are lost forever: they scrapped the machine shortly
after.

Well, there are plenty of people actively working on the BSD tree.  I
wouldn't consider it orphan.

I think you would run into extreme resistance inside SCO at the
moment, more than you would for, say, System V Release 1.  Although
it's obsolete, it wasn't that long ago (3 years?) that it was earning
more money for SCO than Open Deathtrap was.

What would you do with a binary license.

FWIW, 386BSD is available in source form.  Dr. Dobbs still has a
CD-ROM that you can buy.  But 386BSD also evolved into FreeBSD, NetBSD
and OpenBSD, all of which are still alive, kicking and further
developing.  Anything but orphans.  I'm writing this on a FreeBSD
machine.

Definitely.

The recent fuss seems to me to be much overdone, mainly because of
a small number of people with strong views and a restless urge to
type.  Here's my view, which I hold with some strength, but with
little religious zeal.

The top of Warren's web page about PUPS says the society is
`devoted to the preservation of all information related to the
versions of Unix that ran on Digital PDPs.'  It seems pretty
clear to me that his original intent was to collect and keep
historic data, not to Promote The One True Unix nor to Support
Software That We Approve Of nor to Make Money Fast.  (No slur
intended on those who do want to do those things.)  Certainly
that is the basis on which I joined the mailing list, and on
which I've contributed the small amount of time I've put in.

It makes sense to me that efforts to preserve post-PDP11 Unix
systems be coordinated with PUPS, whether that means folding
them into the same society or just having several groups that
share.  I would suggest that a single society (even if run as
several distributed pieces) would probably be less work in the
long run, and think that `UNIX Heritage Society' is a fine name.
(Just plain `UNIX Society' is too broad; it sounds like a
duplication of USENIX.)  Those who think `heritage' and
`preservation' are dirty words are, I think, missing the point;
see the paragraph above.

All of this is likely to involve more work for someone.  I don't
know just who has done what to make PUPS work, but it looks to
me like the bulk of the work has fallen on Warren; certainly he
did the single hardest part, that of getting things started.
Those of us who think the society should do more things should
be prepared to put our money, labour, and whatnot where our mouths
are.

In that spirit: I'm not likely to have much time to help out for
the next few months, as I'm starting a new job, and just keeping
my project to recover the old manuals into machine-readable form
will soak up most of my spare cycles.  (Apologies to all that the
samples and whatnot I'd hoped to put up on the web still aren't
up, by the way; winding down my present work commitments and
trying to arrange a graceful startup of my new ones has taken a
lot more effort than expected.)  It may be possible in my new
world to help out with some computing resources, e.g. a Canadian
mirror of the PUPS archives; I'll try to plan for that in the
already-being-planned upheaval of my new world's computing environment.
If the master PUPS site is short of resources, e.g. could use
another disk or two, I'd be happy to help out with some cash.

I encourage others who can help out to speak up.  Judging by the
amount of mail that has passed through the mailing list recently
(almost 5% of an RK05 by my count), there should be some spare
energy out there somewhere.

It may also be worth while to approach USENIX for support;
preserving UNIX heritage is certainly not foreign to them, and
their current president has some history of preservation work.

I don't like the idea of focusing the group on versions of unix with 
source licences available for a number of reasons. Expensive source 
licences are available for new versions of unix. If the limitation is 
to an inexpensive hobbiest licence then a somewhat arbitrary price has 
to be set for inexpensive.  A second, and more important objection is 
that we are explicitly excluding users who want to use the free PDP-11 
unix binary licences. Finally, users of other vintage unixes with legal, 
binary only licences would be excluded.

How about a direct approach. 

Create UBOS, UBOS spells out to Unix Based Operating Systems.  PUPs would 
then be a sibling as would other potential *nix based OS forums.  the key 
is if you not sure, it goes to UBOS and from there vectored to the best 
fit forum.  Possible sibling forums could be NIX-32 for the 32bit and 
NIX-16 for the other yet not defined 16bit *nix.  there are also 8bit 
flavors and of course 64bit ones as well. No doubt I'm missing a few.

No no no!  This is really bad.  We should not try and sit down and say
who or what we exclude and who or what we include.  There are hundreds
of Unix and Unix-related systems that ran or run on all sorts of
hardware: trying to define some arbitrary border is just bogus, and is
also pretty disturbing in various respects (`you over there, you're
running a 4.2BSD-derivative system with lots of non-bell/non-Berkeley
code in it on something that isn't even a vax, *you* can't talk to
*us* cos you're not pure enough, nah nah nah').

Let's just not stress about this stuff, and let anyone who is
interested in older Unixoid systems be involved.  The only logical
dividing line is the 16-bit/32-bit one -- really the PDP11/bigger
system one -- and even that is furry (where does 32v live, or the
interdata port, or ?).

It's not like the list is suddenly going to get taken over by people
trying to talk about Linux or Solaris or something: those poeple have
their own lists and are quite happy there.  If people ask
inappropriate questions they won't get answers (or will get polite
pointers to ask somewhere more apropriate).

As for name, I still like my own suggestion of `proper unix
preservation society', though I can see there may be copyright issues.

Most of all, can't we stop all this silly meta-discussion and actually
talk about real interesting stuff!  Here's a question I'd actually
like to know the answer to: have there been ports of Unix or Unix-like
systems to machines with non-power-of-2 word sizes or other `strange'
(by modern standards) machines?

--tim (who's running a 4.2BSD-derivative system with lots of non-bell/non-Berkeley
       code in it on something that isn't even a Vax.
       And is also on holiday, so won't be reading this stuff for a while)

Ok, here's the decision (for now). The PUPS mailing list now has the working
name: The UNIX Heritage Society. The email address will stay the same for
now. The mailing list topics are controlled by its members, so feel free to
chat about PDP-11 UNIX, 32-bit UNIX, Unix derived systems, your cat (well,
maybe not). I'm happy for chat about systems which don't require UNIX source
licences, too.

Many people should set up web pages to cover their own particular interest.
Mine's at http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/PUPS/
Someone (me?) will set up a web page describing the charter of The UNIX
Heritage Society, with pointers to everybody's web page.

If the mailing list becomes too diverse, then people are free to set up
other mailing lists with more restricted topics. Again, I'll add hyperlinks
on the The UNIX Heritage Society web page to the mailing lists.

Suggestions for a better name then `The UNIX Heritage Society' can be mailed
to me :-) Suggestions for the charter of `The UNIX Heritage Society', or
whatever you want to call it, can also be sent to me. I'll add hyperlinks
on the The UNIX Heritage Society web page for each suggestion.

I'd rather this thing be all-inclusive, rather then exclusive. At the same
time, I want people to feel free to set up web/mail resources with more
specific aims. For example, the PUPS web pages are going to stay unchanged.

Now, as Tim suggested, let's stop going round in circles and actually
get back to DOING things :-)

Cheers all,
	Warren

All,
	Kirk McKusick has updated his web page about his 4CD set of BSD
releases at http://www.mckusick.com/csrg/

Status: production is delayed a further week. Unfortuntely, Kirk is
just about to go off overseas for three weeks, and won't be back
until the end of August. You may place your orders on his web page,
but things won't start to happen until the 1st of September.

Cheers all,

	Warren

All,
	The zeroth version of a web page for this all-encompassing group
thingy to cover all Unix preservation/development etc is now at:

	http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/TUHS/

Feel free (if not compelled) to mail me with suggestions, hyperlinks,
background artwork etc. Michael, would you be able to knock up a VAX UNIX
web page so I could add a hyperlink to it?

Thanks,
	Warren
