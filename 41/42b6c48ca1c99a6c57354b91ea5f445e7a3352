I'm sure that Norman Wilson will answer with a more definitive
answer, but...  2 reasons: there wasn't the concept of a "release"
with 8th, 9th or 10th Edition, they were purely internal
always-in-development systems. The other reason is that, as time
went on, more code from non-AT&T places was incorporated. It will
be difficult to get the clearance from all the copyright holders
to let a snapshot of any of these systems out.
