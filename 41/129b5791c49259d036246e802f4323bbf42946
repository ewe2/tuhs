That's application-specific, not distribution or OS specific.

I have 58 subdirectories of ~/.config on my workstation at work; that's not
deviating much from your case; 58 directories (indicating about 58 apps),
2047 subdirectories, 7422 files, 481MB of data, the largest bits being
cache data for Google Chrome web browser.

I have had little reason to worry about this; I tend to concur.

Yeah, the time they tried doing that, we got "XML everywhere," and
that wasn't a notable improvement.

What you see on mobile devices these days is that the ".config/" file
is a SQLite database, which is where both configuration and application
data are captured.

As someone that spends a great deal of his time writing SQL code,
I find that not too heinous; others might disagree.  I think having a
SQLite file is better than getting some heinous XML file.
(Especially if the XML file is some thinly disguised serialization of
a hierarchy of COM objects, where modifying element order would be
liable to make your Windows application blow up.)

The "mobile platforms" have gotten quite a lot of milage out of using
SQLite databases (true both on Android and on iOS); there could
be worse things.

The SQLite web site does have a page somewhat proselytizing
this:  https://sqlite.org/appfileformat.html

I heard D Richard Hipp (author of SQLite, now head of the dev team)
explain this at PGCon 5 years ago <
https://www.pgcon.org/2014/schedule/events/736.en.html>

He also contended that the world might be a better place if LibreOffice
documents were captured as SQLite databases rather than being bundles of
XML stored in a .zip archive.  That's a nice lively argument to have.
Actually poke at the slides at PGCon 2014; he makes similar arguments
about git repos (what if metadata were in a database?) and ePub book
files.

If we were going to forcibly shoehorn everything into one thing, I think I'=
d
rather that than a lot of the alternatives.  But I'm admittedly excessively
comfortable with SQL ;-)

I can live with us having a number of data formats, particularly if
they remain simple.

When confronted by a difficult problem, solve it by reducing it to the
question, "How would the Lone Ranger handle this?"
