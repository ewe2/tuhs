This is essentially what happened when I was working at Oberlin College.
Around 2005-2006 we bought a dedicated appliance to handle spam (with
around 5000 active email addresses at any given time, it was a lot of spam)
but within less than a year it became completely overwhelmed and we needed
to upgrade to a much more powerful and expensive machine.  We switched to
Google Apps very shortly afterward and it saved countless hours on the back
end and provided a better experience to our users.  Initially I wasn't
particularly happy about the fact that we were no longer directly in
control of our mail, but the benefits far outweighed the drawbacks.
