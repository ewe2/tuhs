<much discussion about quadratic search removed>

All I remember (and still support to this day) is that I’ve got a TERMCAP=‘string’ in my login scripts to set termcap to the specific terminal I’m logging in with.

Long ago this made things much faster. Today I think that it is just a holdover that I’m not changing due to inertia, rather than any real need for it.
