Apologies that this isn't specifically a Unix specific question but I 
was wondering if anyone had insight in running domain/OS and it's 
relationship to Plan 9 (assuming there is any).

One of my early mentors was a former product person at Apollo in Mass. 
and was nice enough to tell me all sorts of war stories working there.  
I had known about Plan9 at the time, and from what he described to me 
about domain/OS it sounded like there was lots of overlap between the 
two from a high level design perspective at the least.  I've always been 
keen to understand if domain/OS grew out of former Bell Labs folks, or 
how it got started.

As an aside, he gifted me a whole bunch of marketing collateral from 
Apollo (from before the HQ acquisition) that i'd be happy to share if 
there is any historical value in that.  At the time I was a 
video/special effects engineer are was amazed at how beneficial having 
something like domain/OS or Plan9 would have been for us, it felt we 
were basically trying to accomplish a lot of the same goals by duct 
taping a bunch of Irix and Linux systems together.

Cheers,
-pete
