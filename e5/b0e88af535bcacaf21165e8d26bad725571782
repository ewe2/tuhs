Watched it & liked it a lot!

I have one nit-pick in the section on early networking: BBN's VAX TCP =
did not allow the =E2=80=98/dev/net/host=E2=80=99 syntax. That =
particular semantic comes from UoI=E2=80=99s NCP Unix, where the 8-bit =
host number was encoded in the minor number of character special file =
=E2=80=98host=E2=80=99 - but it did not carry through to the BBN code.

Other systems used something similar. The Chaos network code made =
namei() break when it recognised the Chaos driver and left the remainder =
of the path for the driver to fetch & parse. I=E2=80=99m also being told =
that Greg Chesson experimented with using the given name of a Datakit =
channel device as the connection string for the switch, but that this =
approach was abandoned early on.

In my view, exposing the host names through integration in the Unix file =
name space makes a lot of conceptual sense, but it unfortunately falls =
down on the practicalities, with the host name set being hard to =
enumerate (it is large, distributed and not stable - even back then).

A question mark is hard pin-pointing the start of Unix networking to V4 =
/ 1974. Yes, that is the earliest evidence we currently have. However, =
Sandy Fraser says that Spider came into operation in 1972 and it must =
have connected to something. Maybe that something was a lab-bench test =
setup, but it could have been a computer - maybe even one running Unix.

There is another candidate for earliest Unix networking as well. The =
tech memo=E2=80=99s from Heinz Lycklama include one on the Glance =
terminal. That memo includes a section on the network used, referencing =
a 1973 report by D.R. Weller, "A High-Speed I/O Loop Communication =
System for the DEC PDP-11 Computer=E2=80=9D. That computer appears to be =
an 11/45 running Unix and the loop is not Spider (nor the Pierce loop =
discussed in 1970/71 BSTJ). I have an off-list question outstanding to =
better understand this.
