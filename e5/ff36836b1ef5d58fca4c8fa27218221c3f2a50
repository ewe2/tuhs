Yes. Pico and Nano have pretty much the same key bindings for
everything that both have (there may be some minor exception), and ^X
triggers an exit. If there are any unsaved changes, it will ask what
to do; hitting ^C at that point brings you right back to the editor.

Wikipedia puts Pine's birth at 1989, and public announcement in 1992,
so that would be reasonably believable with DOS boxen as terminals...
