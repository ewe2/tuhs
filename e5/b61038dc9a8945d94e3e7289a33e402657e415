First of all thanks to everyone who replied following my earlier  
enquiry.

Someone is selling what he claims is an 11/73, in the UK: http:// 
cgi.ebay.co.uk/Original-Vintage-DEC-PDP-11-73-Display-All- 
Working_W0QQitemZ110191110904QQihZ001QQcategoryZ4193QQssPageNameZWDVWQQr 
dZ1QQcmdZViewItem

It looks may be too expensive to me (he's listed it before and no one  
bid then).  But if I was interested my guess at questions to ask  
would really be what disk (model) does it have because that's what  
would affect reliability the most.  Anyone have any suggestions as to  
anything else I should ask?

Thanks, and apologies if this is abuse of the list (someone say if it  
is, and I'll shut up).
