I may have mentioned restoring root directory using peek/poke
commands of a primitive boot loader.  Right before Comdex
(fall 1981) someone accidentally wiped out the root dir.  IIRC
we had just two systems that actually worked. The other person
was copying the floppy to the second system when something
went wrong.  The backup didn't work. And this was a Comdex
special filesystem (with demos for the show painstakingly put
together and no time to recreate it all from scratch). I
happened to remember inode & block numbers of the first few
things so I fixed up the root dir enough for the system to
come up & run fsck. Luckily very little was lost and we were
able to repair the demos and run them at Comdex!
