Did anyone watch his talk?  I just tried and couldn't make out what he was
talking about.

Bryan's a smart guy but a little subjective.  I spent a day wandering
around San Franciso with him (we used to live within a few blocks of
each other) talking tech stuff, hardware, os, etc.  He was completely
rational, smart, insightful, until we got to either sparc or solaris.
Then he was subjective as hell, he just couldn't back away from them
enough to make an objective comparison to other solutions. 

Funny thing was that so long as sparc/solaris weren't the subject matter
he was very objective, could see the pros/cons of anything.

I guess he drank the Sun koolaid.
