In a previous private e-mail I received from Kirk, he said:
	The folks at UC
	Berkeley have always required me to track distributions of the SCCS
	files as they somehow think of them as still sensitive.

which implies that the SCCS files cannot be released publicly. However,
the SVN version is a "derivative" of the SCCS files and, on that basis,
is publicly available. Go figure :)

Cheers, Warren
