A) The original WD UART chip had very limited buffering.   The timing was
such that as high rates it could not empty accept a second character
without the first being overwritten.  This was a long-standing issue for
many UARTs long in the 1990s.  The original chip NS built and IBM used on
the PC (the NS8250) was notorious for the same problem.  By the time of
Motorola's 6881, it had 8 characters of buffering IIRC.

Great, now I'm having flashbacks to upgrading my 4-port serial card with
16450s and then 16550s in the early 90s.
