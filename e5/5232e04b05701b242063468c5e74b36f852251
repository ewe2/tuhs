The HTML rendition of the paper is much improved now, thanks
to Naoki Hamada.

Incidentally, I also associate the term "deadstart"
with CDC/Cray.  Maybe London or Reiser had
previous association with that world.

On the other hand, in really early Unix, the
"cold boot" paper tape recreated everything
on the disk.  Really cold, just like the "operating
system conversion" section of L&R, or for that
matter the corresponding section of the one
by me and Johnson about the Interdata work.
