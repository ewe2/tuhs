The folks behind the Nerves Project (https://www.nerves-project.org) =
have done some serious thinking about this question, albeit mostly =
confined to the IoT space.  They have also written (and distribute) some =
nifty implementation code.

I won't try to cover all of their work here, but some high points =
include:

- automated build and cross-compilation of entire Linux-based systems
- automated distribution of (and fallbacks for) updated system code
- separation of code and data using read-only and read/write file =
systems
- support for multiple target platforms (e.g., processors, boards)

- Erlang-style supervision trees (via Elixir) for critical services, =
etc.
- extremely rapid boot times for the resulting (Linux-based) systems

For more information, check out their web site, watch some =
presentations,
and/or (gasp!) try out the code...
