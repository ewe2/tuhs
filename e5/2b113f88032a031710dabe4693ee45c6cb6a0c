The problem is that only by failing, you can approach a test suite that gives a 
sufficient code coverage.

The current method is that every time a bug in the test suite or the POSIX test 
is discovered, the text and/or the test suite is fixed. Platforms that passed 
the test are however not withdrawn their state. They just need to fix their 
problem in case they like to get a certification for the next version of the 
standard, if they implemented things the wrong way.

BTW: The OpenGroup manages the POSIX text and after a new version has been 
accepted, it is reviewed by the IEEE people. This usually causes aprox. 6 
months of delay, but no real changes in the text.
