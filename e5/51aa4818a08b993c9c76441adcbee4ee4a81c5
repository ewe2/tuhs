I was not a particularly early adopter of Git; I was already a couple years
into usage of darcs.

A one-time colleage, Graydon Hoare, was one of the designers of Monotone,
which definitely influenced Git.  (He's more recently known for the Rust
language, and presently works at Apple on their Swift language.)  Arch,
Bazaar (bzr), Mercurial (hg), Codeville were also out there at the time.

It's rather interesting that Git happened to "win" that particular war;
there were various DSCM systems with similar (and dissimilar) capabilities
emerging in around 2003-2005.  Various were reasonably "production worthy."

Indeed, it's quite fair to say that at the time Git emerged, there was a
very active set of competing distributed SCMs out there.
