Yes, this is the big one.  It turns out to be solvable, but not using
IC's.  National DS3862 would be good, but it just went out of production...

I'm looking into making a "trapzoidal driver" (i.e. controlled edges)
using a FET and RC on the gate.  Someone else suggested it and it
sounded like a good idea.  Certainly easy to model/simulate first.
