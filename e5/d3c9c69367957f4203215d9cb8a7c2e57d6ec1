The Taylor UUCP is part of pkgsrc (started by NetBSD but supports many, many Unix system platforms; see pkgsrc.org ):

> The Taylor UUCP package provides everything you need to make a UUCP connection.  It currently supports the 'f', 'g' (in all window and packet sizes), 'G', 't' and 'e' protocols, as well a Zmodem protocol, the FX UUCICO 'y' protocol, and two new bidirectional protocols. If you have a Berkeley sockets library, it can make TCP connections. If you have TLI libraries, it can make TLI connections.  It supports a new configuration file mechanism.

The "t" protocol was for use with TCP over the Internet.
