Thanks for the pointer; it sounds like a great paper, but alas the only
copies I could fine online were behind paywalls.

Yes, we had it at MIT.

As I've mentioned, I have this goal of putting the MIT Unix (the kernel was
basically PWB1, with a host of new applications) sources online.

I have recently discovered (in my basement!) two sets of full dump tapes
(1/2" magtape) of what I think are the whole filesystem, so if I can find a
way to get them read, we'll have the V6 fsck - and much more besides (such
as a TCP/IP for V6). So I think you may soon get your wish!
