The Gould powernode was my first experience of unix at uni.
They must have had a source licence,  as in grubbing around in the filesystem,
I eventually stumbled across source code - certainly for user space,
I can't really recall if they had kernel stuff as well.

Reading the code for ed, and seeing the internal implementation of regex's was
an eye opener.
