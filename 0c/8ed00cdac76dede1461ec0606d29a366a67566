Hello!
In NYC the machines who sell MTA  transit cards and refill them are
running Windows Embedded. And not the most up to date version. I've
watched them cause the classic BSOD more then once, and sometimes
worse.

The actual hardware that's delivers the cards and the single use ones
are running something else, and appear to be VME based. The whole
thing is a revolting kludge that's asking for trouble.

Oh and Dan Cross? Thank you for your service to this country, again and again.
