I like the following part from this article:

"Vendors including Oracle, Informix, and Computer Associates have
_recently_ announced plans to support Linux".

No mention of *BSD systems which were also open source at the time.

This was the beginning of the decline of *BSD systems in the server market
and it was 20 years ago.  Things went much more downhill since then...
