This was always described to me as the canonical reason why setuid 
interpreted scripts were a security hole, irrespective of any specifics 
in the shell or other interpreter.

However, there's a workaround: use fdescfs.  fdescfs allows the kernel to 
open the script, and then pass the fdescfs path for the (already open) 
descriptor to the interpreter as the command to run.

According to https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/#setuid, this 
is supported by many systems, including Solaris, several BSDs, and OSX 
(with a sysctl).
