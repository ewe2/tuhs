Speaking for Linux, quite badly, though there are some patches that
allow you to limit forks per user. There's even a bash version,
":(){ :|:& };:", which will infinitely fork off bash processes. (It
defines a function calling itself in the background, and then
immediately launches it)

The max number of processes is not so much a problem as the fact that
they are all draining the system resources. Besides, one is likely to
run out of memory before one hits the max process number in Linux
anyway.
