Yeah, cool, sorta like the SGI stuff, but that was stuff that you had to 
add and SGI had to add.

The only place I can see dma right into user buffers would be if the user
blocked in the read, it was to a raw device, *and* the OS took care to make
sure that those page[s] were locked.  I can see the 1st 2 but I've not run
into the last one except for specialized stuff like O_DIRECT.
