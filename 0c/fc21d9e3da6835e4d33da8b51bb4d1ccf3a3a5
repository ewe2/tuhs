W which was done at Stanford and is definitely related to (direct parent
of) X Windows.   Cheriton of course is the place to start, although I've
lost track of him.  He's in the valley somewhere, he made billions funding
Google ;-)

V Kernel and the Stanford University Network (SUN) terminals were all
developed around the same time as W.

FWIW: Gettys & Schiefler might have of the W â€‹sources squirreled away - as
they started with them at MIT; but rejected it as the base for a set of
reasons which I forget now; but did take a number of the ideas. Jim showed
me a demo of early X and W side-by-side a long time ago.  IIRC the basic
site protocol and the approach where the 'server' was on the local system
and the 'client' was remote came from W. [I'll try to ask Gettys what he
has off-line].
