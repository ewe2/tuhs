HP was much better than AIX, you could ignore their admin crud and
just edit the /etc files and stuff worked.  With AIX, I never figured
out how to not use SMIT, it was pretty intertwined with everything.
It was super annoying, I'm not saying it didn't work, it did, but it was
very clunky and you couldn't just go edit /etc/fstab and make stuff work
(well, I couldn't, maybe there is someone who could).  I hated it.
