Subject: [pups] Ultrix bootable disk images in UNIX Archive
Message-ID: <200102210250.f1L2oeq04843@henry.cs.adfa.edu.au>

Hi all,
	Bill Gunshannon has sent me his Ultrix-3.1 disk images, and they
are now in the UNIX Archive at PDP-11/Boot_Images/Ultrix-3.1. I've knocked
up a short README from his e-mails too.

Cheers,
	Warren

Yep, that's documented in 
http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/Vtserver/vtserver/vtreadme.txt as follows:

   The file .vtrc is the server's configuration file. Lines beginning with
   hashes are ignored. The first (non-hashed) gives a shell command to set the
   correct speed and parity of the serial line. The second line names the
   serial device. Remaining lines name the fictitious tape's records, and
   should be tinyboot, copy, and the name of your disk image.

Thanks, can you suggest changes to the above document which would help
to clarify this?

Also, Fred van Kempen has added commands to send down the bootstrap
code if the PDP-11 has ODT. I'll add this to the server once I get the
code from Fred.

Thanks Ian, yes I'm always happy for feedback. You might also try the
two Ultrix RL02 images that Bill Gunshannon also donated to the archive,
as he booted these on an 11/23 ok.

I know it is probably simple, but my experience is with the real
thing and this is the first time I have tried to do anything but
play with one of the emulators.

How do you create new blank disk images for the Supnik emulator??
In particular, I am trying to create some RM03's to give me more
room to work with Ultrix-11.  I am trying to make some install
kits on different media so that more people will be able to get
it, not only on emulators, but also on real machines, where it
is much more fun.  :-)

I have tried using the empty files the emulator creates.  I have
tried dd'ing /dev/zero into a file to the size of the disk.  I
have tried using format from xxdp.  Nothing seems to work.  Is there
a specific procedure to follow?? 

Any help greatly appreciated.

Further good news: it boots!  I have a V6 image from Ken Wellsch
(thanks, Ken) booting on my 11/34.  Now I have lots to figure out....

I likely come across as an arrogant SOB - I hardly deserve credit for
the image.  My part was one of deciphering what came off an old 800 BPI
mag tape a decade ago and caring about preserving this bit of the past.

Folks you don't know like Ian! Allen who handed me the tape from the
Computer Graphics Lab at U of Waterloo (and the CGL folks for hanging
onto the tape in their library) to folks like Alan Bowler who kindly
pulled a raw image of the tape off on our old Honeywell system because
all our UNIX systems did not support 800 BPI on their tape drives any
more...

Those are just some of the people that preceded that image - not even
mentioning the folks that brought you V6 in the first place...

Then afterward folks like Warren for tirelessly making PUPS happen...

Cheers,

-- Ken
