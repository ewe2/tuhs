I needed to look up something in the Bell System Technical Journal 
(Wikipedia didn't have it) and discovered that the old Alcatel-Lucent 
site that used to host a free archive of BSTJ no longer seems extant. 
(No surprise, the Web is nothing if not ephemeral.)

After a bit of Googling, I did find that the archives are now residing 
at <https://archive.org/details/bstj-archives> and found what I was 
looking for there.

Hope others find this link useful. At least until it too "sublimaates".
