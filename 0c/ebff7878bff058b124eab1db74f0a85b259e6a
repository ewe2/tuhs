It's certainly clear that some kind of primitive is needed to create
new threads.  An open question is whether if there exists some kind of
"new thread" primitve plus either spawn(2) or some kind of "create a
child process and then then frob like crazy using 'echo XXX >
/proc/<pid>/<magic files>'" whether there still is a need for a
fork(2) system call.

Obviously, as soon as we start going down this path, we're deviated
quite strongly from the "radical simplicity" of Unix Version 7 that
people have accused modern systems (whether they be Linux or FreeBSD)
of lacking.  It's rather interesting that we haven't heard complaints
about how people who dare to try come up with new API's are somehow
traitors to "The Unix Philosphy" that we've seen on other threads.  :-)
