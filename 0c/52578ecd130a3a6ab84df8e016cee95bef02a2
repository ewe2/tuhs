Oopa, spoke one google search too soon. I found this:

"Sandy (A. G.) Fraser devised the Spider local-area ring (v6) and the
Datakit switch (v7) that have served in the lab for overadecade. Special
services on Spider included a central network file store, nfs, and a
communication package, ufs. Datakit, a =E2=80=98=E2=80=98central office=E2=
=80=99=E2=80=99 for data
communication, gav e added impetus to research in distributed computing.
Fraser undertook the Unix Circuit Design System (see CDL in section 4.3) to
support his hardware projects"

s
Manual, 1971-1986" by Doug Mcillroy.
