Proof by example: "TERM= man man" i.e. turn off all possible highlighting 
etc, and it's still readable (but you do get a warning about your terminal 
not being fully functional or something - big deal).  Try doing *that* 
with your fancy doc system...

I've forgotten who designed the "man" format (JFO?) but it's great, and they
deserved some sort of an award for it.

As for the kids of today, well, eventually they'll learn that their kids 
in turn will get to choose their nursing home :-)
