Very nice talk with lots of good background. It made me think of the boxes
of DECTapes we had under the Unix room floor, and what we might have lost.
(Volunteers did manage to recover a couple of them, but time was short).

PWB inaccuracy: The talk said that tools like grep and sed came from PWB,
but that's not true. They were original, as I'm sure Warner knows; he just
misspoke. Slightly more important: PWB also did not introduce the idea of
the shell (neither did Unix, for that matter), although there was a
distinct shell for that system that included the legendary pump operator,
later superseded by here documents. The flow from PWB back to the main
research line was a trickle at best. We had bad NIH in 1127.
