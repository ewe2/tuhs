In final year Comp Sci we had to write a compiler, so I told my lecturer 
(Ken Robinson) that I was going to do it in SNOBOL.  He threatened to fail 
me if I did...  I ended up using ALGOLW instead, and IMHO it was an 
amazing piece of work, being able to correct syntax errors so that it 
could continue compiling etc, and proved it by writing a program with 
every possible error being auto-corrected and producing the correct output 
when run.  That listing and deck of cards are long gone, alas.

As for APL, I see you've never used APL\360 on the Kleinschmidt 
(pronounced "Kline-shit") terminal.  A matrix printer, it regularly 
punched holes right through the paper; one joker put a page on the Comp 
Sci noticed board with a reddish IBM JCL card showing through, with the 
inscription "Who said APL programs weren't transparent?".  No, it wasn't 
me; I was responsible for certain other shenanigans instead, but I'm 
unsure of the Statute of Limitations...
