Not a summer employee, but an MIT undergrad intern for most of a year,
Alan Snyder was involved with the transition from B to C, suggested the
use of a preprocessor, and the && and || operators.  He brought Yacc and
C with him back to MIT and the Dynamic Modeling PDP-10.  He wrote a
retargetable C compiler and a host of Unix utilities for ITS.  This
confused the rest of the users, who couldn't make sense of the terminal
after AS has logged off.  The C language enjoyed a rather modest success
on the ITS operating system; for example the "R" typesetting program and
the Dover printer spooler was written using Snyder's C compiler.
