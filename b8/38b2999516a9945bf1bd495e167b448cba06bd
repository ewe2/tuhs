I don't think quotas are dead. It seems nowadays the "preferred" storage
backend for email on Unix/Linux mail servers is Maildir, and Maildir uses
the
filesystem as its own backend, together with the filesystem's quota facility
to give or take storage space to/from mailboxes -- yes, provided the users
are real system users and not "virtual users", but still.

What is "dead as the dodo" is multi-user shell access. But that does not
mean
multi-user shell access should be removed from modern systems, no matter how
dead it may be.
