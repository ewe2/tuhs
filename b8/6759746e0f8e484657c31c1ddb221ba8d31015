Doug, I was also halfway through a disassembler. I take a 2-pass approach.
On the 1st pass I collect interesting addresses, e.g. for jsrs, branches
etc. Then I allocate labels based on address order. Then on the second
pass I use the labels when printing. I'll send you a copy of the work
so far.

Cheers,
