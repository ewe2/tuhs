Subject: [TUHS] TCP/IP on a System III?
Message-ID: <20100321140911.284b64b4.lehmann@ans-netz.de>

Hi,

has someone ever tried to grab the old BSD sources where TCP/IP showed up
first and tried to use them to implement TCP/IP support for an old SYSIII
UNIX (ZEUS comp.)?
I tried this but I got scared by so much things which would need to be
done, inter-process communication, pseudo terminal support are just the
"starting points" and at the end it is also the kinda old C compiler
which has problems with the BSD sources (#defs to long for the cpp for
example)...

Has someone experience with this kind of topic?
