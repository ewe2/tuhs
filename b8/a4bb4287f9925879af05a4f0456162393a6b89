You have to consider that each language is a child of its time;
the culture of each programming language is shaped by the people
who use it, write libraries and books and teach others.

If you would introduce the C language today for the first
time, it wouldn't become the same language that we like. Its
libraries and culture would be very different because today's
programmers are different. Likewise, would Go have been
introduced in older times, it probably would have evolved
differently.

Thus, with liking the minimalist/powerful balance of C and the
style of how programs in C are written (because that C culture
has grown decades ago and is now also a part of the language)
you actually say that you like the old times better than the new
times. (I don't blame you for that.)

This all is much more about culture and what types of people
program and the reasons why they program and the kinds of
projects they do and the kinds of companies and their motivation
in programming and how all this shapes the culture of any
language ... than it is about specific languages itself, IMO.
