It should be very simple.

Several people have built IDE controllers for the QBUS.

A unibus controller will be very similar except for the obvious
differences in the bus interface.

Yes, but assuming that you are only implementing programmed i/o
there will be so little logic involved that you might as well just use
discrete TTL.

In fact, DEC used to make single height modules which did address
selection and interrupt control (M105 and M7821). If you could find
a pair of those, your work would be almost completely done for you.

Yes - very straightforward.

Yes, make sure that you use appropriate bus transceivers, In particular,
make sure that your bus drivers conform to the unibus spec, can sink
sufficient current, and do not have rise times that faster than the spec
allows.
