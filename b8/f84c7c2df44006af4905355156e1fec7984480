I recall Dennis discussing the feature at some length before installing it.
So the exact semantics, especially the injected argument, are almost]
certainly his. I don't know whether he built on a model from elsewhere.
#! appeared between v7 (1979) and v8 (1985). As v8 was never released,
it clearly made its way into the world via BSD and USG. BSD, being
more nimble, was likely first.
