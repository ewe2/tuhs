Subject: [TUHS] pdp11 question
Message-ID: <Pine.BSI.4.64.1011131436510.185@malasada.lava.net>

How much does an old pdp-11 type system cost these
days (ie. a pdp-11/40 with disks and terminal capable
of running something like 1st, 6th or 7th ed)?

How much power do they take up to power on?
Whats maintenance like on those things?

I've always been curious.
