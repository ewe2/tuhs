I stand corrected.   I pulled up the original typewritten Dartmouth BASIC manual and indeed the indices start at zero (though many coding examples don't write the zeroth element).   By default arrays were 11 elements long.   You could change that with the DIM statement.   Yes, the value given to DIM is the highest index making a DIM A(20) defining a 21 element array.

In fact, they give you eleven elements from 0 to 10, which means that code which *uses* 1..10 is compatible but wastes some space.
