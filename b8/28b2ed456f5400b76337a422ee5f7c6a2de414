Sure.  I was just tempted to exaggerate this discussion with:
"init 0, halt or shutdown".  But such commands had no been
implemented even in 7th ed, yet :)

I wonder if Warren rather had different issues in mind,
which would lead to "unexpected" downs. The previously
mentioned resource problems probably match this--not too
suprisingly, because I always had the impression that Unix
aimed at protecting processes from each other, not users.

I'd like to remind of an according, earlier, quite fitting
discussion from DMR:

In "The UNIX Time-sharing System--A Retrospective"
the paragraph "Security"
