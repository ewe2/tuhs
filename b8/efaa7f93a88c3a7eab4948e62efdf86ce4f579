According to =E2=80=9C20 years of BSD=E2=80=9D, there was a steering =
committee to inform the development of what would eventually be 4.2BSD =
Unix. The committee had the following members:

Duane Adams and Bob Baker: DARPA

Bob Fabry, Bill Joy, Sam Leffler: CSRG

Dennis Ritchie:  Bell Labs

Alan Nemeth, Rob Gurwitz: BBN
Dan Lynch: ISI

Keith Lantz:   Stanford
Rick Rashid:   CMU
Bert Halstead: MIT
Jerry Popek:   UCLA


I=E2=80=99m intrigued by the composition and the rationale for each =
member. Some of it is obvious, some of it is not. According to =E2=80=9C20=
 years of BSD=E2=80=9D what DARPA wanted was:

"In particular, the new system was expected to include a faster file =
system that would raise throughput to the speed of available disk =
technology, support processes with multi-gigabyte address space =
requirements, provide flexible interprocess communication facilities =
that allow researchers to do work in distributed systems, and would =
integrate networking support so that machines running the new system =
could easily participate in the ARPAnet."

As I understand Duane Adams was the contract manager and Bob Baker a =
DARPA vice-president. The CSRG crowd are also clear, they were going to =
do the work.

Then it becomes less clear.

I can certainly see the logic of asking dmr to provide his guidance, =
also in view of Bell Labs expertise in working with large scale =
communication systems. I can also see the logic of having the BBN and =
ISI folk there, representing the Arpanet community and doing the work on =
the new TCP/IP protocol stack.

I=E2=80=99m not sure about the four others. They seem to be one each for =
4 main computer science schools in the US at the time. Rashid and Popek =
had moreover recently completed distributed systems (Aleph and LOCUS). =
Halstead seems to have been working on messaging systems at the time. =
I=E2=80=99m not sure what Lantz=E2=80=99 spike was at the time.

All in all, a strong focus on distributed systems and messaging. No =
people with apparent links to virtual memory research or disk access =
research. Other than dmr, no research people from industry. For example, =
nobody from Xerox Parc. Nobody from IBM, HP, DEC, DG, etc.

Any and all recollections about the committee and its composition =
welcome.
