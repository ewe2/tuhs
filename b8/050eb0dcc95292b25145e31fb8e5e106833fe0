As I understand it, the difference in cache access vs
other caches/memory access times allows for timing attacks.
By its nature a cache is much smaller than the next level
cache or memory so there will have to be a way to evict
stale data from it and there will be (false) sharing and
consequent access time difference. Knowledge of specific
attacks can help devise specific fixes but I don't think
we can say unequivocally we have seen the worst of it.=20
