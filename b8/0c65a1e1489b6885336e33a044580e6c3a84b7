At my university there's a grad class that's ostensibly on reverse
engineering,but you can't really disassemble anything if you don't
learn assembler, so you learn it.  The downside, I guess, is that
I've read a decent amount of x86 assembler, but written very little.

I don't think it's a bad way to learn, but of course, Larry was
talking about teaching a nice instruction set, and you
kind of lose that.  But you get Windows DLL function calling 
back as a booby prize.
