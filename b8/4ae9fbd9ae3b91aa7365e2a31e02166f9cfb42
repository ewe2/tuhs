I was one of the people who happily left Pascal behind to move to C.  But
in retrospect, I think the computing world would've been better off with
Pascal, modified slightly to allow passing variable-length arrays (like
TurboPascal).

I never did make the move to C++ - I've written only a little code in it.
Instead, when a lot of people were moving from C to C++ or Perl, I fished
around and hit upon a little-known language called Python (OCaml was runner
up).  My management was practically nonexistent back then, so no one told
me "No, use what everyone else is using!"
