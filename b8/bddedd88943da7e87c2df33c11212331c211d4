Subject: [TUHS] Uploading things into the Unix Archive
Message-ID: <20030717001407.GA25399@minnie.tuhs.org>

Hi all,
	I see I've built up a long list of e-mails from people who have
stuff to donate to the Unix Archive. There is now an FTP upload area on
the machine: ftp to minnie.tuhs.org, cd to incoming.

If you do upload anything called XXX, please also include a README.XXX file
so I know what it is, where it came from and other useful information.

If you have material that cannot be publicly released at present, but
would like it archived for safety reasons, simply use random file names,
and tell me the correct names in the README file. I will squirrel these
things away for later.

The area is set to allow uploads and to see the directory contents. No
downloads are possible.

Thanks all!
	Warren
