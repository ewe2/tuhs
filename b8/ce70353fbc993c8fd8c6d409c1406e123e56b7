Absolutely. Using my "comments as the plot" analogy, that would be like the
main character in a movie saying "this is a chair" instead of "this is my
dad's chair".

So much more meaning ;)

And bringing it back to UNIX, I remember reading here on this list that
comments were sanitized, removing any humor. Anyone got any good examples
of that?


Well, I remember many years ago seeing a comment in the Linux kernel to the
effect that the kernel would never be larger than 2 MB IIRC. Which to me is
kind of humorous in retrospect.
