So if you have a run of SPL instructions, interrupts are locked out for the duration.    If you can fill your address space with SPL instructions (provided the OS doesn't fail in the process), you can cause an uninterruptable loop.   Interupt includes the HALT switch on the front.   You have to use the BUS RESET to jab it out of its catatonic state.

Hmm. Ok. Gotta check this out. Thanks for the details.
