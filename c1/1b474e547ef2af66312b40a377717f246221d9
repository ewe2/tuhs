So my kid is using LaTex and I'd like to show him what troff can do.
For the record, back when he was born, 20 years ago, I was program
chair for Linux Expo (which sounds like a big deal but all it meant
was I had the job of formatting the proceedings).  LaTex was a big
deal but I pushed people towards troff and the few people that took
the push came back and said "holy crap is this easy".

My kid is a math guy, does anyone have some eqn input and output 
that they can share?

Thanks,
