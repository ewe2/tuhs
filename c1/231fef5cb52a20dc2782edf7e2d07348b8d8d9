I don't think so.  Is ;login: a peer-reviewed journal?  It doesn't look
like it to me.  Still, the current state says:

    The origin of the name cron is from the Greek word for
    time, χρόνος (chronos), according to its author Ken
    Thompson[2][better source needed]. Others have suggested that the
    name comes from the Greek God Chronos[3] or that it is an acronym
    for "Command Run On Notice"[4] or "Commands Run Over Night",[5]
    but the references lack substantiation.

Even if someone is still grumbling on the talk page, that doesn't
substantially misrepresent anything that I can see.

        Is it not written, "That which is written, is written"?
