Short answer: there is no special case in nvi.
P or p put back the contents of the last delete.
u undoes whatever was the last change (including the last undo or redo).
. repeats whatever was the last modifying command.

A detailed answer would merely confuse you. At least my attempt at it!
Suggest you try out various combinations in nvi and compare with vim.
