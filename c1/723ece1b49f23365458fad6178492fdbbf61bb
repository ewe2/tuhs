Warren,
  being as you have already answered my question regarding how this
effects BSD 4.x, that leaves only one question.  Does this require
that the Caldera Copyright notice be inserted into all the source
files before they can be released anywhere??  For example, if I put
up a site for the continued develpment of Ultrix-11 do all the files
need to contain the Caldera Copyright before I can allow people to
work with them??  Mind, I don't mean the whole text of the message,
I merely mean the line Copyright Caldera 2001, 2002.......
