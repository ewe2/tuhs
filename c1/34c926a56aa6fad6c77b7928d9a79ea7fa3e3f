I second Dennis's vote for Primix as "weirdnix".

The other weirdness was the high-bit of ASCII being set due to the
convention on Primos (they feared to ever change it to avoid upsetting
customers).

People went mad trying to port applications to it due to these
differences. Primos defaulted to all UPPERCASE, and I vaguely recall
having to poke about for a fair while when starting Primix to convince
the Prime terminal handler to switch to lowercase.

There was an attempt to produce a native port of Unix for Prime
computers but I believe it was squashed by Prime management.
