The groff list had some interesting ideas how this could be
achieved for groff, too.  And those tools can UTF-8 input.
They also can other things, if you go for using them.  They can
not generate the output for my (simple) macros that these generate
for groff, the traps do not work the same, but i never really
digged into that.  They can also TrueType fonts.  And they have
a nice simple build system.  All this would be great to have for
groff.
