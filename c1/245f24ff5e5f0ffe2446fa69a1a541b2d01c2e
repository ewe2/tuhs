As well as the 310, which was not a desk*top* but a whole desk with a
PDP/8-A built into it.  The first regular job I ever had was with a
company that sold these along with their accounting software.

I got involved when they switched to developing for the PDP-11, writing
in Dibol and PDP-11 assembler.

But you, Wormtongue, you have done what you could for your true master.  Some
reward you have earned at least.  Yet Saruman is apt to overlook his bargains.
I should advise you to go quickly and remind him, lest he forget your faithful
service.  --Gandalf
