well,

pdp11/34 don't boot :(

same problem. so here i want to describe anything i can.

-------------------------------------------------------------------	

well, this is the list as is taped on the CPU cover, compiled by hand.
i have verified, and all boards are in the place described here, 
except (1)


So, let's try to boot:
----------------------

1) turning on the chassis 

2) turning on the RX02 floppy module, from rear switch

3) pressing WRITE PROT and turning on the RL02 DISK module, from 
   rear switch

4) turning on the CPU module, from rear switch 

5) checking that disk is UNLOADED (LOAD unpressed).. at this time,
   all 4 RL02 lights are turned ON: LOAD, 0 READY, FAULT and WRITE PROT.

6) turning on main CPU from frontal knob (from DC OFF to DC ON):
   fan & rumors, "DC ON" red led led on. 
   inside the cpu:
   - RED led on M7891 board on 
     (this led, identified as "D3" on my schemes, is described as
     "PAR ERR INDICATOR", connected to pin 6 of E33, a 74S74. 
   - The green led on the board is OFF. looking at the board, i can
     see that is JUMPERED! so, it CAN'T turn on ... someone know why ? 
   - in every restart, the display show a different number (this is
     normal, i think)
   - RL02 Lights status: LOAD is on, 0 READY is off, FAULT is off and 
     WRITE PROT is on.

7) pressing LOAD, the LOAD light turn OFF, the disk will spin up 
   and after about 30 seconds the "0 READY" white light turn on. 

8) pressing "CTRL-BOOT" on the CPU CONSOLE will flash FAULT lights on 
   RL02 just for an istant, and after this nothing happen:
   - RL02 lights status is : LOAD off, READY on, FAULT off, WRITE PROT on.
   - CPU show "165504" and RUN led is off. BUS ERR led is off. MAINT is
     off, the only led on is "DC ON".

9) pressing again CTRL-BOOT obtain the same effect.

during this, nothing happen on serial console.

------------

Booting manually (inserting the octal code to boot from RL02):

this is the boot code, found in "E-10 Loading Software Bootstrap":

HORRIBLE NEWS:
==============

i wrote stuff in 001000, and i read OTHER THINGS. so i can't
manually boot!!!

writing 111111,222222,333333,444444,555555,666666,777777, i
read    000111,000000,000110,000440,000101,002640,000100

but i read every time different contents :(((

maybe i have to add the bootstrap code in a different location?
maybe the 7891 board is totally broken ???

maybe the problem was the substitution of the SN74LS175N with an
hitachi HD74LS175P ?

HELP!!!

==============================================================

Photos of boot sequence, chips, schematics details and something
can be seen on http://www.freaknet.org/asbesto/pdp11. sorry for the 
bad quality but they was taken from a color quickcam.

we are working on a pdp11 section of www.freaknet.org to collect any
useful information.

any help will be appreciated (and ... maybe .. any SPARE PART :)
