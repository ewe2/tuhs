(the current inode number),

Static is a much overloaded word in C, it's just a global variable.

Yes, and in the version 7 version of icheck
(http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Trees/V7/usr/src/cmd/dcheck.c) they
appear to have fixed it.
It is set to zero before both the pass1 and pass2 loops.

I'm pretty sure whoever added the feature to check more than one file system
at a time didn't test it very well in V6.
