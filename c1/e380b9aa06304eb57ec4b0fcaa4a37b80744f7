Subject: [Unix-jun72] File ownerships
Message-ID: <20080506095920.GA36926@minnie.tuhs.org>

In the V1 filesystem, there are a few files are owned by users which are
not in the /etc/passwd or /etc/uids files:

xrwr-  6  2860  169 Mar  7 12:23 /bin/cal
xrwr-  4  7154   61 Jul 21 12:42 /bin/roff
-rwr- 28   304  448 Jun 30 20:31 /usr/lib/fr0.o
-rwr- 28 12222  449 Jun 30 20:37 /usr/lib/filib.a
-rwr- 28  9158  419 Jun 30 20:46 /usr/lib/libf.a
xrwr- 28  3462  491 Jul  1 16:35 /usr/fort/fc1
xrwr- 28  3238  498 Jul  1 16:35 /usr/fort/fc2
xrwr- 28  6840  505 Jul  1 16:35 /usr/fort/fc3
xrwr- 28  4918  519 Jul  1 16:35 /usr/fort/fc4

Now, I know that ken worked on the Fortran compiler, Joe Ossanna (jfo)
wrote roff, and in V6 & V7, ken had uid 6 and dmr had uid 7. So I
propose the following:

 - add ken == 6, dmr == 7, jfo == 4 to /etc/passwd and /etc/uids, as
   new files in fs/new. Thus jfo will own /bin/roff and ken will own
   /bin/cal
 - modify the permissions file so that the Fortran files which are
   uid 28 become uid 6 == ken.

Sound reasonable?

Cheers,
	Warren
