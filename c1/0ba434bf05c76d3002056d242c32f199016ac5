Subject: [TUHS] Happy birthday, J. Presper Eckert!
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.21.1804090925260.767@aneurin.horsfall.org>

J. Presper Eckert was born on this day in 1919; along with John Mauchly, 
he was a co-designer of ENIAC, one of the world's first programmable 
electronic computers.  Yes, there is a long-running dispute over whether 
ENIAC or Colossus was first; being a Pommie, I'm siding with Colossus :-)
