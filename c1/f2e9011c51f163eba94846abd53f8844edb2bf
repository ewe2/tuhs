Hello,

Which revisions of the "C Reference Manuals" are known to be out there?


I found this:
https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/cman.pdf

Which seems to match the one from V6:
https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/tree/Research-V6-Snapshot-Development/usr/doc/c

"C is also available on the HIS 6070 computer at Murray Hill and and on
the IBM System/370 at Holmdel [3]."


But then there's this:
https://www.princeton.edu/ssp/joseph-henry-project/unix-and-c/bell_labs_1369_001.pdf

"C is also available on the HIS 6070 computer ar Hurray Hill, using a
compiler written bu A. Snyder and currently maintained by S. C. Johnson.
A compiler for the IBM System/360/370 series is under construction."

Due to the description of the IBM compiler, it seems to predate the V6
revision.

Both above revisions use the =+ etc operators.


Finally, this version edited by Snyder:

https://github.com/PDP-10/its/blob/master/doc/c/c.refman

"In addition to the UNIX C compiler, there exist C compilers for the HIS
6000 and the IBM System/370 [2]."

This version documents both += and =+ operators.
