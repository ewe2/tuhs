So come, ey, Mr. Spinellis has a devilish red focus on FreeBSD.
No other BSD in sight.  For the git clone of FreeBSD that i have
i see groff-1.09 import as a series of committs starting with
[b4b083cfbe2] around 1995-01-17.  But i better should not have
looked, back then perl was still part of the base system, and
today Lua is missing, too.

P.S.: depite the fact that my VServer (still) runs Alpine happily.
At least there is awk, i currently have a mail-server rotation
period of ~12 hours because of otherwise valid nonsense
connections that blacklistd is not covering, and isn't it absurd
that i need to parse log files to recollect state that the server
has readily available.  But why complain and not coding something
better, yes.
Ciao.
