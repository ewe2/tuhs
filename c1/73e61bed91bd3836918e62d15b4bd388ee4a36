I still use it, BitMover's MLA (signed by the likes of Intel, Cisco,
IBM, HP, etc) is maintained in troff.  And one of those companies,
not to be named, shoved it into word (in fact they all did that part),
turned on track changes, made some typo like fixes, turned off track
changes, and changed some major stuff.  I took the word doc, extracted
to text, ran it through my formatter and diffed 'em and found the
unwanted changes.  Said company proceeded to be shocked!  shocked!
shocked, I tell you!  Shocked!  that this had happened and it must
have been a huge mistake!

Go roff.  Or go diff.  Or something :)
