Hi,

Anyone know the status of the writers workbench (WWB)
which was a seperate package even in System III days 
I think.

I know about style and diction which was shipped with BSD4.1
which (again wooly memory) was an early subset of the
whole wwb package.

I was hoping to compile it up and use it to help me
improve my written English!

-Steve
