I'm guessing a little here, but could it be related to poor command
line argument parsing in some shell, where "-i" forces the shell to
start in interactive mode and the shell looks for parameters
_anywhere_ in its argv[] (including argv[0]), not just at argv[1] and
later?

That would match the result described by Alec, and my modern dash's
man page does give that meaning for "-i", but it also feels like a
trivial bug to fix in the shell without prohibiting setuid scripts...
