My spouse (Vicki Brown) worked in the initial A/UX group and I =
contracted for it (reviewing the man pages).  Here are a few historical =
tidbits...

A number of A/UX boxes were purchased and immediately reloaded with Mac =
OS (because only the A/UX boxes were available with 80 MB disk drives).

A/UX had an "Eschatology" feature whose purpose was to bring a damaged =
operting system back to a known working state.  It was based on a text =
file of metadata and a small set of replacement files (e.g., commands).

The A/UX installation kit was delivered on several dozen floppy disks.  =
In order to minimize the number of disks, Vicki implemented a bin =
packing algorithm.  It grabbed promising sets of files, compressed them, =
and checked the resulting size.

One challenge in building the kit was creating a boot floppy.  To make =
this possible, Vicki created a precursor to busybox: a single program =
which ran under various names, providing subsets of common commands' =
functionalities.  Because this shared the libraries, it saved lots of =
space...
