Hi, all!

Once, I was dismantling very old very long dead rusty box, which once
ran some version of SCO UNIX.
And I've got a strange device I've seen nowhere else - floppy-attached
tape drive, labelled Irwin, model 285. Drive looks
OK visually, motor wiring is perfect, so I can't see why it won't work.
I tried to make it run with old and new versions of Linux, but failed.
Do anybody have any documentation
regarding this?

Also - how wide these devices were used? I've never met one before
while I can't say I have little IT experience.

All the best,
S.
