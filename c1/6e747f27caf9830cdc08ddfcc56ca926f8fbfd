Perhaps impertinent since it's not part of the UNIX standard, but probably when
I first started using emacs. I have also grown to appreciate ed, though I
learned that quite a bit later.

A reminder that we're here to discuss Unix Heritage, so I'll nudge you
if the conversation goes a bit off-topic.

So I'll kick off another thread. What was your "ahah" moment when you
first saw that Unix was special, especially compared to the systems you'd
previously used?

Mine was: Oh, I can:
  + write a simple script
  + to edit a file on the fly
  + with no temporary files (a la pipes)
  + AND I can change the file suffix and the system won't stop me!

I was using TOPS-20 beforehand.

Cheers, Warren
