So that sounds like a different problem.  People correct me if I'm
wrong but the exabyte drives seemed to have a head alignment problem.
If you bumped the drive, the head moved and it stayed moved.  So now
it can't read the tape because the head is offset.  I have no data to
support this but I suspect someone that really understood these drives
might be able to move the head back in alignment.
