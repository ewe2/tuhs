Basically, until C came along, the standard practice was for indices
to start at 1. Certainly Fortran and Pascal did it that way. I suspect
that all the Algol family languages did too, but I only did a little
Algol W programming in colledge and that was long ago. I think Cobol also.

Pascal (IIRC) allowed you to specify upper and lower bounds, something
like

	foo : array[5..10] of integer;

with runtime bounds checking on array accesses.  (I could be wrong ---
it's been a LLLLOOONNNGGG time.)

HTH,
