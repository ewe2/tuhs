Indeed, it can be argued that the statement refers to 386BSD Release 1.0
sec, not the 386BSD Reference CD-ROM as a whole, but it is hard to draw
a line, if any.

Same issue here, would excluding eg. .book & .articles make the Release
incomplete or not?

The only thing I could find that makes some sort of demarcation is the
installer, which leaves some bits behind when doing a full install.

Without vehement arguing from stakeholders or copyright lawyers to the
contrary I assume the same and thank you for putting it up there.
