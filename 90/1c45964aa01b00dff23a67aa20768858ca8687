I think the status of SysIII was always a bit murky.  Whilst it may
have been old SCO's intention that the Ancient UNIX license covered
SysIII, the license doesn't say so.  Since the license doesn't
explicitly allow SysIII, it would be up to you to convince the judge
that the license does implicitly cover SysIII.

Of course, by publishing SysIII, SCO have blown any trade secret claims
relating to SysIII out of the water.  But that doesn't make it legal
for you to use it.
