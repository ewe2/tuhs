=46rom June to September 2000 (exactly 20 years ago) I merged some parts
of BSD/OS 5.0 into FreeBSD version 4, releasing it as FreeBSD 5.0.
This was part of an agreement (obviously) with BSDI to improve
FreeBSD's SMP processing.

For this purpose I received three source trees, labeled 4.1-RELEASE,
4.1 and 5.0-smp-devel.  I still have them, and as far as I can see
they're complete.

Clearly they weren't maintained under git, since it didn't exist yet.
The headers suggest RCS or (probably) CVS.  For example:

 *	BSDI exec_elf.c,v 1.7 1998/08/24 19:03:08 torek Exp
 *	BSDI kern_fork.c,v 2.10 1999/04/20 22:40:19 cp Exp

None of this was "open sourced"; we were allowed to use it for this
specific purpose.  But if you can get approval from the copyright
owners, I'll happily give you a copy.

You might also be interested in my report of the meeting which set
this off, at http://www.lemis.com/grog/diary-jun2000.php#15

In passing, it was an interesting experience.  Both BSD/OS and FreeBSD
derived from (most recently) 4.4BSD Lite, but they had diverged to a
point where it was really painful to merge the code.
