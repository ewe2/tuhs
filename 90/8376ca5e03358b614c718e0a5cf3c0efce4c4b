Hence the link to Presotto and Winterbottom's paper.

It's a simper model. It is no big deal. I was intimately
familiar with sockets and the BSD networking stack (worked in
a router startup from the beginning where we rejiggered the
FreeBSD network stack to support N forwarding tables,
additional protocols, interface types etc.  etc.).

I believe not having to be compatible with Unix meant plan9
could evolve unimpeded. But IMHO it was not so far out that a
merge would have been impossible. plan9 had "ape" (ansi/posix
environment) for compiling posix compatible programs but that
didn't go far enough. The result might've been a worse plan9
but a better Unix.

The last version I used SunOS3.5 on a 4MB Sun 3/50. It was
very nice in its day. Once I got a 386 (or was it 486) with
16MB of memory & BSD, the Sun machine saw less and less use.
