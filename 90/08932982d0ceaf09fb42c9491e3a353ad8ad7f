Yes, WAITS is what I was thinking of. As I mentioned in my previous mail,
it feels like the SAIL timesharing systems get mentioned briefly in
a lot of accounts of historical computing, sometimes with mention that
they had some sort of (relatively) advanced video terminals, but no
in-depth descriptions of the actual hardware/software environment.

I will take a look at saildart.org and the Prolegomenon, thanks!
