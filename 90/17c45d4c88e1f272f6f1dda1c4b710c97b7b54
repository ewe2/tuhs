I was really thinking in terms of userland (I don't spend much time  
poking around at kernels...).  You could still argue that OS X is not  
a good example of a modern BSD userland of course - I don't spend  
enough time with *BSD to really know what they are like, other than  
that, for the most part, everything has been replaced by GNU versions  
of itself in all of these systems :-).  i guess OS X is kind of like  
what I would have hoped a BSD might turn into in some sense.
