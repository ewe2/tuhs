If you LISTREVERSE’ed a Lisp program, it would look like PostScript with parens!

I have been wondering about that for years. 

Here’s the manual! LISTREVERSE is documented on page 9-3. Maybe if I printed out the "READERS COMMENTS" form at the back of the manual, wrote my question in big upper case block letters, then ticked the "If you require a written reply, please check here” checkbox, then “Fold Here” and “Do Not Tear - Fold Here and Staple” as instructed, I could mail in the free first class pre-addressed, business reply mail, no postage stamp necessary if mailed inside the United States envelope, and they’d write me back a nice letter telling me what the fuck they were thinking.
