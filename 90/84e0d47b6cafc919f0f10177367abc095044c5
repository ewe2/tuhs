Bill Cunningham:

      Has anyone had the idea to take the ancient unix, at least in spirit
  into the modern age?

Warren Toomey:

  Plan 9?

=======

Plan 9 is to UNIX as SVr4.2.2.2.2.2.2 is to Sixth Edition.

If that's the spirit of the modern age, give me the good
old leather-bound days, without all that modern rhythm-
type dancing and hooting and waving.
