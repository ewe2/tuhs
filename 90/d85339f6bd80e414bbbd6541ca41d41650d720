Props for hosting your own site.

I think /need/ may be a strong word.

I *strongly* believe in the various cache ability aspects of unencrypted 
HTTP.

That being said, I understand and believe in the two following reasons 
for supporting encrypted HTTPS:

1)  Encryption (from a verifiable source) makes it next to impossible 
for malicious actors to inject things into your site's traffic.  (Think 
about the various JavaScript injection techniques used for ads / 
tracking / malware / crypto mining / etc.)
2)  Creating more noise for someone with higher value signal to hide in 
when they really need to.

Finally, things like Let's Encrypt and other free cert providers make it 
much less expensive to use encrypted HTTPS.

I'm perfectly fine with people running unencrypted HTTP and encrypted 
HTTPS side by side.  Even if you don't do a redirect from unencrypted 
HTTP to encrypted HTTPS.

It's really up to each site administrator.  I'm 60% for and 40% against 
encrypted HTTPS everywhere.
