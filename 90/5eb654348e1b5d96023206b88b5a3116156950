What machines are we talking about then?
PDP-11 have 8K pages. VAX have 512 byte pages, if we talk about hardware.
(And yes, I know pages on PDP-11s are not fixed in size, but if you want 
the page to go right up to the next page, it's 8K.)

Weird comment. What does that mean? On a PDP-11, all your virtual memory 
was always there when the process was on the CPU, but it might not be 
there at other times. Just as not all processes memory would be in 
physical memory all the time, since that often would require more 
physical memory than you had.
But you normally did not have demand paging, since that was not really 
gaining you much on a PDP-11. On the other hand, overlays do the same 
thing for you, but in userspace.

So you would claim that ATT Unix did not have virtual memory because it 
didn't do demand paging?
