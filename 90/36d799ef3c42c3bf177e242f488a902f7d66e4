As a newb who doesn't know any better than what it seems they do, in 
keeping with the original minimalism:
"as" should have been "me" for mnemonic encoder
"ld" should have been "la" for link and assemble
and some obscure function in /usr/sys/ken/sys1.c or maybe even 
/usr/sys/dmr/sys1.c, because one guy's folder is as good as the next, 
should have been called pldr(), for program loader, which would have 
been the program 'loader'.
