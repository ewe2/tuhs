Warren, I see that there is a 4.4BSD-Alpha subdir in the TUHS archive.  Do you
want a final CSRG 4.4BSD tape to add there too?

Thanks, I have to go through your archive for it now.

Oh, I was talking about co-workers.  There's been so many layoffs where I work
that I was hoping to get some more help.

It's so difficult being you.  I was able to save myself the time by
using the 4.4BSD version of learn(1) since it has already been
modified for CRT terminals.  You will have to re-invent the wheel
because of your politics.

Thanks again.  I really do appreciate all the work you have done in this area.
