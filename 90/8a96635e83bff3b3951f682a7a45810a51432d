In roughly 1977 I was trying to use the 'fc' Fortran compiler
that came with Version 6 Unix at UC Santa Barbara. I needed to
do some binary I/O to read digitized speech data. That compiler
was very limited so I did what anybody would do back then - I called
Dennis Ritchie, who had written 'fc', to ask him what to do. I remember
he was surprisingly gracious but I don't remember what he said to do.

Version 7 Unix came to UCSB soon afterwards and I started using it.
It was easy to call C routines from it, which I did for a number of
low level purposes. However, I soon discovered some 'f77' bugs.
Fortunately Stu Feldman was visiting UCSB so I was able to demonstrate
the bugs to him personally. Again, I don't remember what came of this
but the Unix world was so small back then that it was common to be able
to communicate with many of the key developers.
