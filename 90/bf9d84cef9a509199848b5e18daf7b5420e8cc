I always understood "open source" to mean this: you have access to the 
code, you can share it, you can modify it, and any combination of the 
above (including commercial exploitation; basically a restatement of 
Stallman's freedoms in simpler words).

As any phrase gets skewed to mean something other than it was intended, 
when most people say "open source", they seem to only mean what I call 
"source-available" - i.e., that there is *some* means by which a mere 
mortal can gain access to the source, but there is no guarantee that they 
can actually DO anything with the source without getting sued into 
oblivion.  I usually say if the code doesn't offer the necessary freedom 
to make use of it. it's not "open source", it's just source.

(For the record: I shifted from the GNU side to the BSD side of the debate 
about 20 years ago.  But I hold no ill will toward people on the GNU 
side.)

-uso.
