Subject: [TUHS] 8th Edition Research Unix on SIMH
Message-ID: <CMM.0.96.0.1490999475.beebe@gamma.math.utah.edu>

I was pleased to see the announcement from David du Colombier
<0intro at gmail.com> of a SIMH VAX image for the newly-released 8th
Edition Research Unix, and I had it downloaded and running in short
order.

I compiled and ran the traditional hello-world test in C,
successfully, but the C++ and Fortran companions would not link:

        # cat hello.cpp
        #include <stream>

        int 
        main(void)
        {
          cout << "Hello, world...this is C++" << endl;
          return (0);
        }

        # CC hello.cpp
        cc    hello.cpp -lC
        ld:hello.cpp: bad magic number

I also tried extensions .C, .cxx, and .cc, with the same error.

With Fortran, I get 

        # cat hello.f
              print *,'hello ... This is a Fortran 77 program!'
              end

        # f77 hello.f
        hello.f:
           MAIN:
        Undefined:
        __bufendtab
        _setvbuf

The missing symbols do not appear to be defined anywhere in /lib or
/usr/lib, suggesting that some V8 libraries have been lost.

David reports privately that he sees the same issues that I see.

Can anyone on this list identify the problem?  Normally, Unix
compilers should supply the necessary libraries for
standard-conforming code, and f77 would silently add -lI77 and -lF77.

The C++ compiler issue seems to be quite different: adding the -v
(trace) option shows what it does:

	# CC -v hello.cpp
	cc    -v hello.cpp -lC
	+ ld -X /lib/crt0.o hello.cpp -lC -lc 
	ld:hello.cpp: bad magic number

The source code, rather than the object code, is passed to the loader.
This may have to do with the choice of extension: what did early C++
compilers expect for filenames?
