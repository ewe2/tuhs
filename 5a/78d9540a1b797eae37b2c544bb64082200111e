That's kind of a strange question.  I was never a "UNIX person" when I was
there because UNIX just wasn't that big a deal then (versions 3-6).  I worked
on other stuff, and used UNIX for documentation.  I was intrigued and learned
a lot more about it, and hung out in the UNIX room late at night because it
was the place to be, but UNIX was a negligible blip compared to everything
else going on there.  Astonishingly enough, people worked on things related
(even if tangentially) to telephony.
