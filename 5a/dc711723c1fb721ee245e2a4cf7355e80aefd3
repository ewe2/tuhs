Hello (again) from Gregg C Levine
The RPM file provided didn't build correctly. Remember I did say that
I use Slackware. I don't have a running instance of Red Hat here.
However, I was able to build a copy of SIMH straight from the current
source code.  One thing does get to me, though. This creation moves a
lot slower on SIMH/VAX, then NetBSD, which worked well enough. I'm
guessing that this is indeed a populated pack you have here, but do
you have any idea as to why it's practically moving slower then a
tortoise? This is running on a Pentium 100.

As to your question, yes they are working on it, moving through the
2.4.2x series of kernels. It isn't pretty, but it is working. If you
want to join the list to offer complements, or comments, or just lurk,
go to their website, and tell the list-manager that I sent you. He'll
give you a good seat.
