I've found tapcat.pl and used it to extract the records from the four tapes.
Here's a quick table with truncated MD5s of the 7 records from tape 1 of each
set, and of the cpio archive which is on tape 2 of each set.

Tape Record	What It Is	Set 1	 Set 2
---------------------------------------------------------
file0.dat 	boot record	ce3dab	 ce3dab
file1.dat 	mini-root	693861	 1b9183	different
file2.dat 	cpio binary	777632	 777632
file3.cpio 	/		5b6ba5	 5b6ba5
file4.cpio 	/usr/src/man	713ea0	 713ea0
file5.cpio 	/usr/src/rje	8d146b	 8d146b
file6.cpio 	/usr/src/graf	7e2afa	 7e2afa

tape2.cpio 	/usr		51b5b1	 a07403	different

tape2.cpio in set 2 seems to be slightly corrupt; cpio -ivt on the file
gives this warning:

  -rw-rw-r--   1 operator kmem         1052 Apr 12  1980 src/games/trk/win.c
  -rw-rw-r--   1 operator kmem         4147 Apr 12  1980 src/games/bj.s
  cpio: warning: skipped 840 bytes of junk
  -rw-rw-r--   1 operator kmem          122 Apr 12  1980 src/games/us.s
  -rw-rw-r--   1 operator kmem        10036 Apr 12  1980 src/games/mail.c

Otherwise, the contents of the two tape2 files appears to be identical, i.e.
the cpio timestamps on all the files match up.

The two file1.dat records differ at position 721; I haven't attempted to
dig any further with these files yet.
