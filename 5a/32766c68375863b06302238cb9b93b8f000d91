That was actually part of the agreement with AT&T to end the hostilities.

NetBSD did it by butchery. FreeBSD did it by reimporting from 4.4lite,
basically (the basically part is a bit messy).

True. I had thought the original FreeBSD 1 repo was now publicly
available. I know I can get copies of it as a FreeBSD project member.

Yea, the FreeBSD CVS tree I think has that history. It started out
life trying to make the patch-kit to 386BSD make sense as dealing with
a boatload of patches soon grew unwieldy as the number proliferated
and you started getting patches on patches.

Don't know anything about that... But the Truth is Out There.

I thought it was just shielded from public view and many of the NetBSD
folks had copies. Could be wrong though.

Yea, CVS doesn't support repo-copying for crap. But it was done to go
from i386 to amd64.

The old CTM archives might have stuff, it that was up and running
before the lawsuit.

I know that the FreeBSD 1 archive exists in multiple places.
Compressed it is 18MB, or 185MB uncompressed (clang's history is
bigger than that, though checked out it is only about 131MB).
