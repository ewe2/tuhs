Whatever we had, it was slow.  Printed one char at a time.  So you got 
good and memorizing the code and only asking to see it rarely.

Be funny trying to explain this to my kids.  I think they'd get it at 
some level but really have no idea how much we worked to not let the
printer do anything.

That speed advantage made them the preferred output device for many-page program listings, as opposed to a teleprinter terminals which were more suitable for interactive computing.
