Subject: [TUHS] Did realloc ever zero the new memory?
Message-ID: <E798E102-2C50-4AB2-92CC-188D05AA951F@kdbarto.org>

I’ve just had a discussion with my boss about this and he claimed that it did at one point and I said it hasn’t in all the unix versions I’ve ever played with (v6, v7, sys III, V, BSD 2, 3, 4, SunOS and Solaris).

My question to this illustrious group is: Did any Unix or Unix like OS ever zero fill on realloc?
