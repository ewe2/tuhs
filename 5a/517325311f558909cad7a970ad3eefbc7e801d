Subject: What is lonex?
Message-ID: <Pine.SUN.3.91.951218171736.5935B-100000@crl12.crl.com>

Greetings:
  I've been playing with the mail system. Mailing to root brings up
                 can't find usr/lonex/xmail
This in itself is not a problem, as I only tried this to see what would
happen. However, I am curious as to what the lonex directory is (was).
It does not appear in my listing of the contents of tape 2.
Cheers!

Hi -

	LONEX _was_ "Laboratory Office Network EXperiment" - a project
	I worked on for many years (we started with V7) and which just ended 
	a couple or three years ago.  We used 11/44s and 70s right up till 
	the end - by which point they were all running 2.11BSD.  It was a 
	really neat system - had a common user namespace (YP before there was 
	YP;-)) amoungst all systems, a (for the time) spiffy text-mode menuing 
	interface to shield users from the fact it was Unix and so on.

	The sendmail.cf as distributed in the 'GENERIC' system kit wasn't
	cleaned up enough.  That reference to a local mailer that I use
	should have been removed.

	Several things to note:

	1) the sendmail.fc file does not exist - on purpose.  You'll need to
	   perform step 2 and then do a "/usr/lib/sendmail -bz" to freeze
	   (pre-process for faster loading) the config file.

	2) the sendmail.cf file is not suitable for use without customizing
	   (filling in the domain name, relay system, etc).

	3) The aliases database (/usr/lib/aliases.{dir,pag}) are not present,
	   on purpose.  You'll want to edit /usr/lib/aliases to suit local
	   tastes and then do "/usr/lib/sendmail -bi" to create the dbm
	   aliases database.

	It's a directory I keep local works of art such as the local mailer
	'xmail' which knew the details about routing mail within the "Office
	Network" we ran.

> It does not appear in my listing of the contents of tape 2.

	It shouldn't have been there at all.

	You should have something like:

# Mlocal,       P=/bin/mail, F=rlsDFMmn, S=10, R=20, A=mail -d $u
Mlocal, P=/usr/lonex/bin/xmail, F=lsSDFMmn, S=10, R=20, A=xmail -f $g $u

	in sendmail.cf.  Simply reverse the commented status of the two
	lines to be:

Mlocal,       P=/bin/mail, F=rlsDFMmn, S=10, R=20, A=mail -d $u
# Mlocal, P=/usr/lonex/bin/xmail, F=lsSDFMmn, S=10, R=20, A=xmail -f $g $u

	And you'll be all set.

Hi all,
        I thought I'd mail to the old unix list to see if you were all
still alive & hope the new year goes well for you. It's been a quiet few
months. I've not heard back from Keith Bostic about his archive. However,
I'm presenting a paper about PDP Unixes at the local Australian Unix Users
Group summer conference next week, should be fun.

Cheers,
