possible components of answer regarding animation/CGI:
o SGI/MIPS/IRIX would have fared better/longer
o Jobs would have pushed Pixar towards Mach
o P4+NVIDIA would still have been disruptive 
(https://secure2.linuxjournal.com/ljarchive/LJ/099/6011s1.html)
o Gates would have done more

Windows had usable TCP/IP, at least starting with Windows 3, from 
Trumpet, Chameleon and others. I found/find the Microsoft 32 bit 
implementation preferable running Mosaic and Netscape, but had to do 
some work with 16 bit Trumpet a few years ago for a client that needed 
me to make some things work in DOS outside of Win 3.1.
