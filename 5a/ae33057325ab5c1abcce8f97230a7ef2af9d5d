Hi,

It's Saratov, not Capatob (Cyrillic). Since it was made by Russians
during the Soviet period, there's no wonder you can't find any
documentation regarding it.

It was made by CIME -- Central Institute of Measuring Equipment.
The company is alive to this day, you can visit the website
(in Russian) -- http://www.cime.ru/ or contact them at
cime at cime dot ru, maybe you'll have some luck.

There's a thread (in Russian) about it:
http://www.nedopc.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9778
 From there I can see that it has FOCAL, Fotran, and assemblers,
just like the PDP.

On front in the center there are five lights that indicate the
step counter.

Saratov is a city on Volga where CIME is located --
