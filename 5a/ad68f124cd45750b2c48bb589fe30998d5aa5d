I agree with Paul, maybe later models worked this way, but the first ASR33
I used definitely did print at strange times.   I have the same memories
from 1967 on a GE Mark III with Dartmouth Basic using an acoustic coupler,
where line noise was definitely a problem.   It would print random
characters, particularly during carriage motion.   Since the only way to
get a copy of your program was with the LIST command, it was rare to get a
clean copy.   If the program was of any length, there was usually a random
character or two overprinted in the middle of listing.
