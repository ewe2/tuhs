I can't see any harm, and it's good to know who you can share stuff with.
Here are the names I have. There are obviously more people/organisations
with licenses.

I understand that Venix is a cut-down SysIII in binary-only format. We have
SysIII in the archive in source form, if that's of any help. I doubt it will
have the device handler for the PRO 380 Time-Of-Year clock.

It's a PDP-11 version donated by Kirk. We also have SysV for the PDP-11,
donated by John Holden, but I can't put it in the archive because the SCO
license specifically doesn't cover SysV.

I can only give the details of the people for whom I actually have
license numbers (both SCO, AT&T and Western Electric). If you _are_
covered by a UNIX source license, and would like access to the archive,
then please fax your license to me at +61 6268 8581. I only require the
pages with the signatures, the license numbers, and the list of UNIX
versions covered.

Thanks,
	Warren
