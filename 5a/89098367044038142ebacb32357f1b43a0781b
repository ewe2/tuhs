Isn't this a rehash of my recent thread? :)

Historically, yes. I was forced kicking and screaming into Solaris back 
in the 90's, because all the CAD/CAM software I administered moved to 
Solaris, while Sun themselves moved to Solaris on their new SMP systems 
like the SparcServer-1000 and even the 670 was more useful with Solaris.

Currently? Solaris - it's NEVER let me down in commercial or personal 
use. Sure, I hit a bug or two here or there, maybe a controller that it 
didn't like, but running PeopleSoft on it, Oracle database, whatever 
else I specialize in, it's been great.

Like I said, I was forced kicking and screaming into Solaris - however, 
once I got used to it, and having used SVR4.2 for a home BBS/USENET/UUCP 
system modem front-end in the early 90's, I quickly grew to like it.

NUMA? Solaris does it very well, probably because of the huge SPARC 
systems carrying over to the Intel world.

I used to run FreeBSD at home, for firewall, and general file server 
usage. Why? Because I was in love with SunOS at the time ;)
