Yup -- disk were pretty expensive in those days ($20-30K for a <100M drive)
so often people did not have more than one.  So they started with rp1, rp2
etc..
As disks dropped a little cheaper and having more than one RP06 became
possible (RP06 aka IBM 3330 - project Winchester --  was a huge 200M drive
- we had 3 on the Teklabs machine and that was considered very, very
generous), then letters became the convention used in /dev/.  i.e.
/dev/{,r}rp0{a,b,c,d..} for each of the minor numbers.

To be honest, I really don't remember - but I know we used letters for the
different partitions on the 11/70 before BSD showed up.

The reason for the partition originally was (and it must have been 6th
edition when I first saw it), DEC finally made a disk large enough that
number of blocks overflowed a 16 bit integer.   So splitting the disk into
smaller partitions allowed the original seek(2) to work without overflow.
V7 introduced lseek(2) when the offset was a long.
