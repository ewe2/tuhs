An interesting question.  I had always thought that SMP was (one of?)
the technical reasons why Sun moved from a BSD to a System V base.
Since then, of course, we've done lots of work on SMP support for at
least FreeBSD.  Does anybody have an overview of how good the support
is compared to modern Solaris?  Is there any intrinsic reason why one
should be better than the other?
