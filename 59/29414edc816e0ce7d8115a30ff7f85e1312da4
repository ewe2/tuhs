No, LSD came from Hofmann, Albert, of Switzerland, found by
experimenting on himself.  (This is i think worth noting for
multiple reasons, first of all because of the fact itself, in line
with good old tradition of sciencists, as far as i know, then
because this was in 1943, and i also had to read a horrifying
vivisection story (with non-human life forms) not to long ago,
where people got space in an english scifientic magazine for
i think it was either about acid or fire injuries, and i do know
now that mice start intense licking when their skin faces acid (or
fire), mind you, i know free (wood) mice which are brave and rush
onto your shoes, free rats which open tunnels only to allow you to
have a look at newborns with eyes closed, and squirrels which just
say hello, if you once in a while spend some nuts and sunflower
seeds.  It will surely help improving something, though.)

But Ecstasy (MDA/MDMA) and such where developed by Alexander
Shulgin of California.
