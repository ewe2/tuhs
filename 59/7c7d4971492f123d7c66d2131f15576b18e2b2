Hi,

(Sorry if this is a FAQ)

I'm trying to boot the 2.11_rp_unknown image from Boot_Images.
This is what happens:

----------------------
gibbon:/net/scharfzahn/playing/boot_images$ pdp11

PDP-11 simulator V2.3d

HALT instruction, PC: 006606 (JSR R5,3162)

----------------------

What am I doing wrong?

	Try "set cpu 22b" instead.  Using 18b tells the simulator you have
	a 248kb (and 8kb for the I/O page) machine and that is not enough 
	for 2.11 to load and allocate all the resources it needs.

> panic: buffers

	Yep -that panic message says the kernel could not allocate any
	memory for the buffer cache.  I am almost certain that means
	there is not enough free memory left out of 248kb.

> What am I doing wrong?

	Try telling the emulator to use "22bit" mode.  If that still
	fails let us know.  Then it will be time for "Plan B" ;)

Hmm, sorry, it still doesn't work:

	Plan B is to specify the amount of memory directly.   Simply saying
	"set cpu 22B" tells the emulator to use 22 bit addressing - but it
	does not say how much memory the system has (it's possible to have
	1mb of memory even though ~4mb is possible).

	Try using both "set cpu 22B" and "set cpu 2048K" - that worked here.

	It may well be that only "set cpu 2048K" is actually needed - I didn't
	try that by itself.

Please don't.  I love reading discussions of random old bits of
hardware, and such discussions have gone on on the PUPS list for a
long time.
