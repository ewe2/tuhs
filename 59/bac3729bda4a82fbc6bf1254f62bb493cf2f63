So at first blush, what it seems like is you need a barrier to starting more
DMA's.  You take the signal, the signal changes state to say to the I/O
system "finish what you are doing but then no more".

Or what you do is kill the process, tear down all of the pages except those
that are locked for I/O, leave those in the process and wait for the I/O to
get done.  That might be simpler.
