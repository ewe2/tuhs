Specific to, I'm guessing, the banking hardware of the Laser 3000/Dick 
Smith Cat?  (I saw a disk image on Asimov with your name on it that 
mentioned the Cat.  I've used a Laser 128, but never a 3000 which is 
apparently a bit more different from a real ][.)

It might be made to work on a real ][ with some heavy wizardry.  I think I 
saw someone on comp.sys.apple2 talking about doing that a few months back.

Running some sort of *x on an Apple ][ would be interesting, seeing as 
it's been done on the C64.  I actually own an Apple //e.

-uso.
