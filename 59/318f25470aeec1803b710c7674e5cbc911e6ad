I was not aware that Kerberos could provide privacy (encryption) for=20

That's why the directory component is so important.  Somewhere to get=20

I think that OpenSSH's certificate support extends that a bit.

I've always viewed LDAP as a directory that can have various content in=20
it.  It then makes this content relatively easy to access.  What the=20
content is is up to the content consumer.  Be it names, email addresses, =

Even if communications with the NIS server was encrypted, I'm not=20
hearing anything that prevents an authenticated user from enumerating=20
NIS.  Even if it was over encrypted channels.

That's what I've gathered from a number of sources.  Which is why I've=20
heard people avoid LDAP directly.  Or at least use something like=20
Samba+Winbind or SSSD as an abstraction layer into LDAP+Kerberos.

(Raw) LDAP and AD seem to be what I see the most of.  I've worked in a=20
