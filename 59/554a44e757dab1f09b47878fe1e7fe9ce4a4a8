Looking at other versions, stty vt05 appears as far back as V6 (it sets
the newline delay - needed because scrolling was slow on the VT05 - and
clears other delays). This is evidence that it was probably used some
places as a dumb terminal.

The VT05 itself was 72x20, all uppercase, and did in fact support cursor
addressing etc, though there's no evidence any Unix applications ever
took advantage of that. TECO apparently did, though.
