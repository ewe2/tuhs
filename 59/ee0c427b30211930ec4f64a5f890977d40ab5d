I overlapped with Pugs at Sun, knew of him, heard he was smart, but didn't
really get it.  Then I saw the way he exposed the iommu to user space
(the bang for the buck was for VMs but researchers that were doing user
space networking also used it), that hit my radar screen as really good
work.

He's had a long career of doing useful stuff, pretty much everything he's
touched has gotten better.

But the important thing is that Tom Lyon wrote a 3270 terminal driver, and it comes with ned, which is a screen editor that feels a lot like XEDIT--which wasn't even in CMS at that point, although EE has been added to the VM370 Community Edition I'm using.  And the man pages are fullscreen as well.
