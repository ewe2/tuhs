I'm pinging my contacts to see if I can find a place to host a mirror.
I think that Oregon State Open Source Lab has a fat link to the net
and I used to know Scott K but he's moved on.  If I get anywhere I'll
get back to the list.

BTW, whoever is the listmom, can you change me from digest to regular?
