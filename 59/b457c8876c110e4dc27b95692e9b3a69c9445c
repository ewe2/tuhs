Subject: [TUHS]  Ninth Edition incomplete?
Message-ID: <201704011338.v31Dcxh3021120@coolidge.cs.Dartmouth.EDU>

>  Does someone have a more complete distribution of the Ninth Edition
From the README and file dates, it is clear that what tuhs has had
evolved considerably from the Research system described in the
v9 manual. It had been ported to Sun and outfitted with X11. Some
lacunae are attributable to the absence of /bin shell scripts;
many things were apparently pruned as being of no interest to
the installation at hand.
It should be borne in mind that there never was such a thing
as a "distribution" of v8, v9, or v10. The manuals described
the Research computing environment, not a package prepared
for shipment. Responsibility for the latter had been taken
over by the Unix Support Group.
It would be interesting to have a precis of the provenance
of the system on view.

Doug
