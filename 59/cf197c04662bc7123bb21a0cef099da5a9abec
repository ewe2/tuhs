This reminds me of a Ken story from the late '90s.  I was at a conference
that I won't name where Ken gave a talk about his compression work; if I
remember correctly his goal was to fit all of the Billboard Top 100 songs
of all time onto a single CD.  He showed us the big stack of disks that he
made to give to us, but then said that to his surprise the the lawyers
refused to give permission.  At that point he became very focused on messing
with his slides while everyone got up, got in line, and took a disc.  After
the pile was gone Ken looked up and nonchalantly continued his talk.

That might also have been the conference at which Ken showed us videos of
him in a MIG.
