Maybe ... maybe not.

I think a number of TUHS subscribers enjoy special configurations.

I'm only replying to the historical aspects.

IMHO the dramatic effect was warranted.  (I was thinking that it's not 
too complex up until you said MicroVAZ III.)

It sounds to me like your MTA is completely separate from the SMTP 
stack.  -  Would I be correct in guessing that your SMTP stack reads 
from and writes to ""queues that look like mailboxes to your MTA?

By the way, what you've done sounds very impressive, and likely challenging.

I doubt that many of todays script kiddies would do such a thing.  I 
like it.

So, what was SMTP used for before you hosted your own email?  Was it a 
minimal implementation to get logs / outgoing messages off of the box?

Could you keep your working configuration and save power by migrating 
your configuration to emulation?  Perhaps on a Raspberry Pi or the likes.
