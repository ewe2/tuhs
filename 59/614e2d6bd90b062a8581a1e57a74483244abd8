I also thought that was bad advise – Jörg Sonnenberger of NetBSD
converted the repository to Fossil.  I have lost that address; he
automatically converts _that_ to git(1) on github [1], which
i track myself, however.

Note that he is the one who is developing the used converter, and
that in turn had some errors in the past, resulting in history to
become invalid.  That didn't happen for quite a while now (afaik!)
but since it was very weird about two years ago and occasionally
happened still last year one possibly should ask him before
integrating all those millions of objects into such a large
repository.
