For VAXen you don't want 4.4BSD, you want 4.3BSD-Quasijarus, especially if you
want pure. Unfortunately, I haven't got the KA640 (3300/3400) support in there,
just KA650 (3500/3600) and KA655 (3800/3900). It would be trivial to add,
though, it just needs to be taught to look at the SIE in addition to the SID,
recognise the KA640, and don't try to touch the non-existent B-cache. This
wouldn't give you support for the on-board DSSI and Ethernet, but it'll run
with your Q-bus devices.
