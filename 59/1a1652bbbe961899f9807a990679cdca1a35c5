I use a quite basic simh.ini without fancy memory manipulations.
At the moment the behaviour is:
1) First boot => enter unix at : prompt => no fsck => root shell
2) ^D => "fast boot" => no fsck => multiuser
3) login + reboot => passed : prompt =>  no "fast boot" => fsck => multiuser
That is with the RA92 image provided with simh for the ESP32,
which contains a command to setup WiFi.

I found at minnie.tuhs.org/Distributions/Boot_Images/2.11_on_Simh
a version where Andru Luvisi has configured a 1MB RAM disk mounted
to /tmp for the temp file required by fsck.  Needed to compile a new
kernel, but with the RAM disk fsck runs nicely. I put a # in front of
rwhod in /etc/rc to prevent it beeing started, but then it never went
into multisuser. No idea why.

Seems to be related to bootdev here:
73Boot from ra(0,0,0) at 0172150
: unix
Boot: bootdev=02400 bootcsr=0172150

But it looks always like this, with and without fastboot.

Thanks
