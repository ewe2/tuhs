I can give a hardy "second" to this statement.  Having to maintain some 
non-trivial in-house packages on Linux distro's as well as on FreeBSD 
really drove this point home for me.  For example, the LOE was 
tremendous to support a Python version which was not supported by RedHat 
for example, not to mention the ongoing effort to keep the primary 
packages and their dependencies up to date was a major challenge as 
well.  Working on the ports tree was much nicer in this regard as it 
allowed me to reuse work done by others.

Having said that it certainly feel that since FreeBSD did not have a 
good story precompiled package management (as opposed to yum, apt, etc.) 
was a real detriment to wider adoption to aspiring hackers. Between 
pkgin/pkgsrc and the new pkg too in FreeBSD I feel they are much better 
positioned for people who just want to install software and get to the 
job at hand.
