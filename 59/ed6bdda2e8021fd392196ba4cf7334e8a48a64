Good morning everyone.  Wanted to pose the question since folks here would =
probably be more likely to know than anyone.

What are the chances that there are surviving tapes of some of the UNIX ver=
sions that weren't so well publicized.  The versions that come to mind are =
the CB and USG lines especially, with PWB 2.0 and TS 4.0 getting honorable =
mention.  If folks will recall, we did luck out in that Arnold, a member of=
 this mailing list, did have a documentation trove from TS 4.0, but no bina=
ry or source code assets.  This had me curious on what trying to unearth th=
ese would even look like.

Has anyone tried to dive deep on this sort of stuff before?  Would it look =
more like trying to find old Bell facilities that might have a tape bumping=
 around in a box in a basement somewhere, or is it more likely that if anyt=
hing survived it would have been due to being nabbed by an employee or cont=
ractor before disposal?  Or even just in general, what would folks say is t=
he likelihood that there is a recoverable tape of any of this material just=
 waiting to see the light of day?  The closest we have on CB is a paper sca=
n of the kernel sources, and I don't know that any assets from USG-proper h=
ave ever percolated up, closest thing to any of that would be the kernel ro=
utine description bumping around on the archive somewhere.  PWB 2.0 is ment=
ioned in several places, but no empirical evidence has surfaced as far as I=
 know, and with 4.0 of course we have the documents Arnold thankfully prese=
rved, but that's it.

Thanks in advance for any insight or thoughts.  My concern is that there is=
 a rapidly closing window on ever being able to properly preserve these par=
ts of the UNIX story, although recognition must be paid to all of the hard =
work folks have done here thus far to keep this valuable part of computing =
history in the collective consciousness and accessible to researchers and p=
rogrammers for years and years to come.

- Matt G.

P.S. Even more honorable mention is the Bell Interdata 8/32 work.  I've rea=
d several places that never saw outside distribution, but I would have to w=
onder if any of that work survived beyond the visible portability changes i=
n V7.
