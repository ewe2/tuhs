A year ago I called novell asking for a sysv license... They had no idea what I was talking about...

Do you think it's either worth regressing sol10 to it's older state by chopping stuff out, or calling novel again?

I know I was lucky to get a hobbiest sysIII license back from old sco (lol is that even valid??????)

Unix got fun when it got more open, but now it feels like the lawyers are going to lock it all up again...

For the record, I'd be a little careful with what you state here.

I've been here for a while and there has been stuff flying by that 

makes me cringe.



I'd like Unix to be free too, see

but I also respect copyright and other IP laws.



I'm somewhat alarmed by what's flying by.  Not from you, John, but others.

Like it or not, those companies have rights.  And also for the record,

I looked over the code in the SCO thing, and they were right IMHO.

Just too stupid to prove it.

&gt; &gt; as far as I recall me, SVID1 is SVR2, not SVR1.

&gt; In any case, the code is in a practical sense unencumbered due to the
