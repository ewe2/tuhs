Subject: Help running 2.11 on Supnik 2.3d

Message-ID: <85ln2jsewz.fsf@junk.nocrew.org>

I've tried running the image in /Boot_Images/2.11_on_rl02 on
Supnik's emulator version 2.3d, but the root filsystem seems
corrupted, with many binaries being unexecutable, bad block
error messages, etc.

Does anyone know how to successfully boot this image?

If this is the wrong place for this kind of question, or if
there's a FAQ on this, then please point me in the right
direction.

Hmm, if I get a chance I'll try it here. Has anybody used this image
successfully?

	Yes.  The problem is not with the images (although the whole "on rl02"
	is a pain - you're far better off using the "xp" or large disk support
	that Bob added).

> If this is the wrong place for this kind of question, or if

	This is a very good place to ask this type of question.

	And now the moment you've been waiting for:  "the Answer" ;)

	2.11BSD is *very* upset at having to run in 256kb of memory.  since
	the kernel plus buffer cache (and other data structures) can easily
	exceed 200kb there is not enough memory left over to run a program.
	Programs such as 'fsck' are fairly large split I/D programs and won't
	fit in the remaining ~56kb or so.

	The quick fix to the problem is adding the line:

		set cpu 2048K

	to the config file before running the simulator.  That will give the
	simulated PDP-11 2Mb of memory which is a real nice size.  Oh, if
	memory is a concern on the system then "set cpu 1024K" will work
	well.  Since there's no networking involved 1Mb will be quite adequate.
	If you were using "P11" (the Begemot emulator) and had the full IP/TCP
	stack, etc then the kernel+networking+buffers can reach close to 400Kb
	and you might want to use 2Mb for the memory size.

	You might also look into the latest version (2.5) of the Begemot
	emulator.  The two key advantages of P11 are:  1) a emulated DEQNA so
	you can place the PDP11 on a network, 2) It keeps _good_ time
	(version 2.4 and earlier had severe timeskew when running compute
	bound programs, 2.5 is awesomely better and within range of "ntp"
	to keep the clock correct).  P11 also supports (as does Bob Supnik's
	simulator) large disks such as the RP06 which is much nicer than
	4 RL02s and a batch of RK05s.

	Hmmm, I'm not sure which rev level of 2.11BSD is in the "on_rl02"
	images - I hope it has the "bounce buffer support" to handle the 18bit
	RK controller on a 22bit bus...   If the RK images show corrupt or the
	kernel crashes then I would suspect the kernel is a bit too old.

	Unpack the "211bsd_on_rl02" images from the .gz images, edit the
	"script" file to increase the system memory and you should be all
	set to go.

	Steven

The answer is: UNIX had / and /usr split by at least the time of the
July 1974 CACM paper ``The UNIX Time-sharing system''.

Here is the evidence:

At http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/PUPS/Images/ken-and-den.txt and
   http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/PUPS/Images/ken-and-den.jpg

you will find a picture of Ken and Dennis at the PDP-11/20 around 1972.
The commentary in the text file from John Holden tell us that the disk
drives are RF-11 and RK03 drives.

RF-11 drives were fixed head drives with 512K of storage with fast access.
RK03s and RK05s could store 2M, but were not as fast as RF-11s.

The source code to (nearly) 3rd Edition UNIX, dated August 31, 1973, only
has drivers for two disks, RF-11s and RK05s. This source code is in the
PUPS Archive, http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/PUPS. You need a Unix src license.

Now, the July 1974 CACM paper says this:

	In our installation, for example, the root directory resides
	on the fixed-head disk, and the large disk drive, which contains
	user's files, is mounted by the system initialization program; ....

To me, this strongly indicates that / and /usr were split by at least
July 1974, if not the earlier date of August 1973.

Cheers all,
	Warren

I just found some more evidence. The 2nd Edition UNIX manual is dated
June 1972, but the actual man pages have their date of last modification.

The manual for init(7), dated 15th June 1972, says:

[ If console switches are set to 173030, a shell is attached to the
  console immediately, i.e single-user mode ]

	Otherwise, init does some housekeeping: the mode of each DECtape
	file is changed to [read-write] (in case the system crashed during
	a tap command); directory /usr is mounted on the RK0 disk; directory
	/sys is mounted on the RK1 disk.

Cheers,
	Warren

And more, from the 1st Edition init(7) man page dated 3rd November, 1971.

	Directory usr is assigned via sys mount as resident on the RK disk.

and sys mount means the mount(2) system call.

Cheers,
