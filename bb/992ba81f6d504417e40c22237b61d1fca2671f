This looks like some really nice work.  I used a BLIT at UW Madison
and loved it, it was way more useful than a terminal and way less 
fuss than a full blown windowing system.  Felt like the knee of the
curve.  All of that over a serial line, that's impressive.

I dunno, but I bet that Rob trys it out just for a trip down memory
lane.

It also now supports executing a local shell or connecting directly to a physical or virtual tty device. It runs natively on Linux or macOS with X11 or Wayland, but I would love help creating a Windows version if you're a Windows programmer (I am an occasional Windows user, but I am not at all knowledgeable about Windows programming).
