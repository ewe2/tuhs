From looking at various changes, it is obvious that the tools group also had 
brilliant people, but it is also obvious that the tools in general do not have
that overall quality level as seen in the kernel.

From looking at projects or features, it seems that the kernel people did add 
new ideas whenever they had the idea. From looking at the progress made in the 
tools, it seems that this mostly happened when a manager decided that it would 
be time to put effort in a tool.
