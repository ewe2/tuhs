Warren,
	The UUCP map data from comp.mail.maps is a two level format: one for pathalias(1) and the rest for various programs. Pathalias will ignore any line beginning in '#' - those are comments to it. Some of those comments have a format specification which other programs can effectively grep for and parse.

So, yes, you can add or modify any line beginning in '#' - pathalias won't care.

Given the Google archive of comp.mail.maps, you can pick your snapshot of the state of the UUCP network. The last one seems to be 1998.

	Erik
