Hi dear PUPS!
It is about one week gone from the mome I got 
sufficiently powerful PDP-11. Before this I ran LSI-11/02 under RT-11
and couldn't think about unix. Those new machine is the
main reason for joining to this list for me.
It includes: KDF-11 CPU, RQDX3, DHQ11 8 line async option,
TQK70 tape controller, 1.5Mbyte of memory etc. etc.
I  also have the complete BSD2.9 source distribution
in tar file and like to run all of the above.
Currently I've started KDF11 and it seems to be ok.
Problems are: It has lots of switches (the same for MSV-11 boards and
RQDX3 and all of that) and have very little docs about
how to set it correctly. When I tried to bring up the KDF with memory
at once KDF said : no memory :-] but it runs ok with 
little 32K memory board from LSI-11/2 ! Seems to me that my MSV-11 boards
have wrong starting address settings or something...
Same story with RQDX3 - currently I have no RDx disks so I thought
that boot my system from RX50 is not a bad idea... I've plugged 
standard 5 inch floppy to RQDX3 sig. dist. connector labeled "RX50"
and fired up the machine. Got nothing. I tried to investigate
what happens to bootstrap. I've detected that during init of
mscp controller it successfully undergoes steps 1 and 2 ( or maybe even 3)
but in next step it returns 0 in SA and bootstrap waits for eternity
when controller will enter next step... Looks like hardware fault, ha?
Then I tried to check my TQK70 board. It had nothing connected to it,
and I traced it's initialization sequence the same way. IT ALSO RETURNS ZERO
in 3rd or 4th init step!. Can anyone help with the above? 
Sincerely yours - Stacy.

You probably don't need to change anyhing on the RQDX3 -- they're usually set
up correctly (because they'e not often changed :-)

During init, the RQDX3 probes the disk(s) to see what's there.  For a floppy,
it checks for an RX50 by selecting the drive, finding track zero, and then
switching the side select.  On a real RX50, which actually behaves as two
separate single-sided drives, this turns off the track zero signal; but not on
any normal drive.  There's a way to fool it, but you need to modify the drive
or add a little circuitry.  However, if you can find an RX33-compatible drive,
that would be more useful anyway.

Big problem: BSD2.9 doesn't support your disk (RQDX3) or tape (TQK70)
controllers.  I'd suggest BSD2.11, but it doesn't run on your CPU.

The best place to ask about these things would be the usenet newsgroup
vmsnet.pdp-11.

	That's almost two problems :-)  

	It might be possible to retrofit [T]MSCP support into 2.9 but it would
	be a lot of work and a system with both MSCP and non-MSCP devices
	would be required.

	Swapping out the cpu card for a KDJ-11AB (M8192 if my memory hasn't
	completely faded) wouldn't be too expensive and would speed things
	up too.  Hmmm, might need a MXV11 bootrom card.  Perhaps a KDJ-11BB
	would be a better way to go.

I just got V7 to load on my 11/83.  Killes 2 hours playing wump.
Who says you need grpahics for games?
:)

Anyway, I know there's no source liscense yet, but can I get someone to
build a kernel for me?  I wouldn't have to see source...  It'd be real neat
to hang this off a termserver and allow telnets...  I'm gonna do that
with my RSTS box real soon, the only limitation here is that V7 is only built
with support for the console.

I have the V7 image downloaded from DEC.  I kermitted it to the 83, and did
COPY v7.DSK/FILE DL0:/DEVICE
It truncated something, but FSCK says the pack is fine.
I have to load RT-11 from the MSCP, then say BOOT/FOR DL0: to start V7, though
because if I tell the ROM to load DL0, it dies saying the disk isn't bootable.
But at least it runs!

Hello,

I'm trying to revive a PDP 11/04, but not having much luck at the moment..
I got a serial terminal hooked up to it, and upon bootup, it gives me the
following on the display:

<triangle sign><triangle sign> 177777 177776
$

apparently, $ is some sort of a prompt. It only accepts two characters,
and after, it seems, any pair of characters, will go on and give me a new
prompt.

Is this some sort of a ROM debugger? What can I tell it? I think I've
tried almost every combination of 2 letters without any success..

Some info about the PDP:

It's a 11/04, with a dual 8" floppy drive and some big cage made by MTS,
with nothing in it but a large number of slots. Has some buttons saying
'STATION 1 DUMP', 'STATION 2 DUMP', and so on.. The floppy drive has two
8" floppies in it, one of them appears to be some sort of a system floppy,
the other has no label.

Does this look like even remotely salvageable? :)

Commands available at this prompt include:

L<space>nnnnnn<CR> - to set an address
E<space>           - to examine the address set with L
D<space>nnnnnn<CR> - to deposit at an address set with L
S<CR>	           - begin running at the loaded address

The console ROM is very picky; all letters need to be in upper case,
and you need to type <space> and <CR> in exactly the right places.
It's also very stupid, in that if you try to Examine or Deposit to
a non-existent address, the only clue you get is that the RUN light on
the goes out and you have restart it from the front.

It'll never run a modernish Unix, but it will run RT-11 just fine.

Is the floppy controller a DEC RX211 (M8256) or RX11 (M7846) or some
third-party clone?  Are there any boot ROM's on the M9312?  The RX01
boot ROM is 23-753A9, and the RX02 boot rom is 23-811A9.  If you've
got a third party RX clone controller, it may have the boot ROM on that
board.  Try examining addresses 173000, 173200, 173400, 173600, and
171000 to see if a boot ROM might be living at any of these addresses.

As this is very non-Unix related, you might want to ask any other questions
you have on a more general PDP-11 related forum, such as the Usenet newsgroup
"vmsnet.pdp-11".

How actually distinguish these backplanes?
I can check whether extended address lines are routed to slots, if 
it sufficient - ok. If not - are there more differencies?

Which logical drive address should be set on floppy?

The time I got RQDX3 it's address was set wrong. I've changed it immediately
but there are lots of other switches...

No problem. I can write this drivers.

About formatter..
The VAXstation 2000 can format iron beds.
You plug in 'any' mfm drive and if the enter TEST 53.
If the machine does not recognize the drive, it will prompt you for drive
parameters.

I've been sorting through some RL02's that came with a 11/23 system
that I bought at a UBC SERF sale a year or so ago.  On these RL02's
there is at least one bootable V6 system, apparently generated
specifically to be run on a 11/23.  This ought to be of some interest
to folks with real 11/23's with RL02 drives, as the other V6 systems
that I'm aware of don't have RL02 handlers.

Here's the question: this RL02 apparently has kernel sources in
the directories /sys/ken and /sys/dmr.  Does the presence of these
files mean that I can only distribute images of this RL02 to those
with source licenses?

A non-legal question: the system identifies itself as "v6" when it
boots, but there is a "v7.h" header file in the /sys directory.
Is this maybe really a V7 system?  Or maybe from an era when the
trnasition from V6 to V7 was being made?  Datestamps on the files
are from 1982.

For those who are listed, a log produced while running in single-user
mode from a copy of the RL02 pack.
Note that although the system was generated for a 11/23, it's
running on a 11/73.  The fact that it has more memory than "max" seems
to confuse the system horribly when it goes into multi-user mode.  Short
of doing a lobotomy, is there any way to get around this?

All,
	I'm starting up a FAQ on the archive of PDP-11 Unix stuff and how to
use it. What I've got so far is at:

	http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/PUPS/faq1.html

but not yet linked to the other pages.

I'm happy to take other questions. I'm _very_ happy to get answers! Answers
will have attributions of course. This is a back burner thing, but I'll go
back through the mail archive and see what I can come up with.
Also note: I will add a table of contents to the top at some stage.

NIkolai!

Your problem MIGHT be because somebody shuffled the cards for you!

There are some classical caveats when it comes to the UNIBUS based system.
a) There must be an uninterrupted grant chain all the way and no holes.

b) There are two types of slots. DMA (also called a MUD or Modified 
Unibus Device) and NON DMA. Default is non DMA. To enable DMA you cut a strap 
on the wirewrapped backplane. (*cringe*)...
This suggests that there are also two types of GRANT cards. One resembling
a dual QBUS grant card but with green handles and one very small "playing
card type" single card with no handle that can be (with force) inserted
backwards and thus burn the bus.

c) There must be a terminator card in the last position of the chain.
I am at a customer site right now and do not have access to my library so
I can not be more specific.. If you have any documentation handy, you should
be able to use above information and find the exact information you need.
If not, you should be able to locate the faulting device by "shortening" 
the bus. You start with CPU and a mem card and install the terminator 
directly after. See if you can deposit and examine stuff into RAM. Then 
put in the device directly after the last MEM card and test it and so forth.
Eventually the system will fail and you have located the problem.
Either remove the problem or get back to us. =)

Note: With no documentation of the devices in question you have more problems.
Some UNIBUSes are standard UNIBUSes. Others are special UNIBUSes for special
device configurations. 

The UNIBUS PDP11 (or VAX) is a challange for the technically interested 
person. =)

Oh yes... You can bypass devices by using the UNIBUS cable (a long stiff 
white flat cable with UNIBUS connectors in each end). Each UNIBUS sub bus is
connected with the previous with a UNIBUS continuity card that consists of
a short UNIBUS cable and two dual cards joined together to form one unit.
If you want to bypass a device, take out the continuity from the start and
end of the device, install a UNIBUS cable at the last position of the
previous sub bus system and the first in the sub bus after the bypassed
device.
UNIBUS cables, continuity cards and grants (and also the terminator) all 
go in the same position across the bus and in no other place.

One error here and it is BURN baby BURN! =/

That would cerainly put it well into the v7 era 9by thre years).  But there
were several differences, as I'm sure Tim knows, and some people didn't change.
 I'd guess this one has back-ported some v7 stuff onto what was otherwise a
'legacy' system.

I think the RL02 drivers were written in Boston for v7 (or am I thinking of the
RX02 driver?).  Maybe v7.h has something to do with allowing this driver to be
used?

I don't know, but if anyone else does, please tell!  My 11/23 system has a
kernel panic if I try to run it on an 11/73 (by swapping out the CPU board).

Interesting... ADVENT is missing from my v7.  Any chance of a copy?

Well, this is what V7.h says:

#DEFINE V7CODE  7       /* IF COMPILING V7 COMPATIBLE CODE */
#DEFINE V7 (U.U_SYSTEM == V7CODE)

and this is what a config file looks like:

# CAT CONFIG.MLAB
# CONFIGURATION FOR EXTENDED CARE PATHOLOGY SYSTEM WITH RL
CONSOLE
SYS
MEM
RL
RX2
ROOT RL 0
SWAP RL 0 19000 1480
CPU     23
FPU
DL 5
LTC

It also looks like there's support in the sources for 11/34's and 11/45's,
in addition to the 11/23:

# CD CONF
# LS
ADEVS           C.C             DATA.S          L-MLAB.S        MAKE-MLAB

Maybe it is the CPU and not the memory that's causing the problem - I was
probably a bit premature in jumping to the conculsion about the memory
(perhaps my 2.9BSD experiences aren't applicable here.)

Sure.  Warren's already moved the RL02 image to Boot_images in the PUPS
archive, and at some point someone (me?  Warren?) might find enough
copious free time to strip out the sources.

The big problem with this V6 system at the moment is that I can't find
the 'mount' executable.  I suspect that the system manager might have removed
or (more likely) renamed it as a security precaution.  (Security?  Unix?
well, you can try...)  I'd like to mount one of the user disks on a
second RL drive, but without 'mount' this is hard.  Anyone have any ideas?
"/dev/rl1" is real and works fine, as I can "od /dev/rl1" without a problem.

Many thanks to Pete Turnbull, who pointed me towards /etc/mount.

Some of the "user" disks appear to be corrupted.  Anyone care to tell
me where to find fsck?

Tim.

Tim,

fsck doesn't exist yet in the V6 world. you want icheck and dcheck... they
need at least one argument which should be the name of a raw device
containing the filesystem you want to check. (Using the block device anme
will work but be much, much slower.)

Guys,
	Just got this in from Dion re the license. No word as to date of
availability yet, I did say `we're waiting....' though.

I sent Dion a draft set of instructions on how to get the license.
Part of his return email goes:

	> 4. For AUTHORIZED COUNTRY, I suggest writing:
	> 
	>       All countries not excluded by Section 5.2

	Yes, very good.  I have no idea how to find that damned
	govt list.  I think our reference is out of date but who

	> 5. You need to list the DESIGNATED CPUs. [Do we? I can't see where
	>    on the draft to fill this in] If you have PDP-11 hardware,
	>    list the number and models of PDP-11s, e.g

	No, it doesnt say that.  It says that on our request, you must
	furnish the list, but we dont demand it up front.  In practice,
	I doubt we will ever ask anyone to furnish this, much less
	do an on-site visit.  Of course, it might be a fun way to
	win a trip to Australia if I volunteer to go on a tour to
	see that our highly valuable intellectual property is 
	being treated right... ;-)

That sounds good to me.

	Warren

Subject: PDP-11 UNIX Src Licenses Available

Hello, you are receiving this mail for one of the following reasons:

	+ you signed a petition urging SCO to make source licenses for
	  PDP-11 UNIX available

	+ your filled in a survey detailing what you wanted in such a
	  source license

	+ you are a member of the PUPS mailing list

I am glad to announce that, as a result of the petition, SCO have made
source licenses available for most versions of PDP-11 UNIX. The essential
details of the license are:

	Covers research Editions 1 to 7, and 32V.
	Covers derived versions of UNIX which ran on PDP-11s.
	Specifically excludes System V onwards.
	Full source code, binaries and documentation.
	Personal, non-commercial use.
	Exchange of sources and modifications to other licensees.
	Non-disclosure to unlicensed people.

The cost is US$100. Details on how to obtain the license are available at

	http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/PUPS/getlicense.html

SCO will not ship any media with this license. The PDP-11 Unix Preservation
Society has a number of volunteers who are prepared to cut CD-ROMs and tapes
in order to distribute the PUPS Archive of old Unix software to licensed
people. Details about this archive are available at

	http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/PUPS/pupsfaq.html

We would like a few more licensed people to volunteer to create CD-ROMs and
tapes, to take the load off the existing volunteers.

Finally, none of this would have been possible without the immense support
which we received from Dion Johnson within SCO. He battled with the legal
eagles over a period of 18 months or so to make the license available. If
you can, please send Dion a thank you card at the address

	The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc.
        400 Encinal Street
        Santa Cruz, CA 95061-1900
        United States of America

        Attention: Dion Johnson

This will be a surprise for him, but I'm sure he will appreciate your
thanks.

In turn, I would like to thank you all for your support. Without the
signatures on the petition, none of this would have been possible.

Most of you on the PUPS mailing list should have received notice that SCO
are now selling the PDP-11 Unix source licenses we have been waiting so long
for. If not, details are on the PUPS web page, and at:

	http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/PUPS/getlicense.html

We only have 6 volunteers ready to write media (CDs, tapes) holding the
archive of PDP-11 Unix material. Anybody else want to volunteer?

SCO will let us set up password-protected ftp sites. I will set up the
PUPS archive here for password-protected ftp. Would anybody else be prepared
to mirror this and also provide password-protected ftp? I'd like one
in the US and one in Europe.

Cheers all,

	Warren
