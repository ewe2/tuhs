Hi Henry,

I expect folks who actually ran this can weigh in with the 'real world' 
perspective. What I can offer is that the document entitled, "Installing 
and Operating 4.3BSD-tahoe UNIX* on the VAX" by the folks doing the 
release (CSRG) is probably canonical:

http://blog.livedoor.jp/suzanhud/BSD/4.3BSD_Tahoe_VAX.pdf

There's a section on migrating 4.2/4.3 to tahoe and the like. After it's 
up and running, it looks a little shy on details, but getting there 
seems well enough documented. If it's anything like 1bsd+, it seems like 
it was usually unpack and copy to the right locations, with the 
occasional compile with the right options thrown in.

Will
