Hello!
Clem by chance do you remember what the error message response was? It
would be interesting to see what phrases were used. For example, on
the IBM side of things, a fellow Adam and I both know, coded an entire
application so that everything it said and did would be in Klingonese.
No I do not remember which one it was, and what have you, I only
remember it surfacing during his talk at the IBM offices here in town,
during the early years of running Tux on the IBM S/390 systems.

I also find it strange that sometimes even Google is thinking in that langu=
age.

t out a patch with a couple of error messages in Klingon and dumped a bunch=
 of information.  Sure enough this was noticed, customer stopped, we got th=
e needed data, as they reported the error.  But it was a high visibility cu=

resident.   We found the bug ;-)
