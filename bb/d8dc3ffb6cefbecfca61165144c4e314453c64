Strange ...

Most of the bookstores seem to have it in stock. Just click on the link
with the "bestbookbuys" 

And on a different note, the book is very good in explaining how it
could
work. But it is describing the version 3.6 of the compiler, so you have
to go through all the sources of 4.1 anyway, because of all changes . 
And you don't touch the book anymore ;-)

cheers & have fun
