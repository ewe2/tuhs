[ This also in from Peter Klapper. The files are at:

This is a 2.9BSD kernel with a backported MSCP driver from 2.10BSD

I tried to make a clean integration of the driver into the 2.9BSD source tree in order to be able use the standard procedures to configure and build the kernel.

To try it, rename the original directories /usr/include/sys and /usr/src/sys and unpack the two tar archives into your /usr directory.

Then change into /usr/src/sys/conf and just do a ./config for the kernel you want.

I made some configurations for:
MSCP23 (MSCP enabled kernel for the PDP11/23)
MSCP73 (MSCP enabled kernel for the PDP11/73)
FLOP23 (MSCP enabled 11/23 kernel for a boot floppy)
FLOP73 (MSCP enabled 11/73 kernel for a boot floppy)
MSCPSH (MSCP enabled kernel for an extended SIMH environment)

You may need to adapt the kernel configurations for the correct timezone and maybe the line frequency.

This is probably the most recent BSD system which runs on the PDP11/23.

There is NO root password in this distribution. For installation on real hardware, at least a Maxtor XT-1085 (RD53) or larger is recommended.
My SMS1000 system currently has a Maxtor XT-1140 installed. Original was an XT-1085 in the system.

The disk layout for these two disks during installation is as follows:

Maxtor XT-1085 / DEC RD53
=========================
1024/8/18
interleave 1,4
--- layout ---
root = ra(0,0), size 3200
swap = ra(0,6400), size 1920
usr = ra(0,10240), size 64180

Maxtor XT-1140
==============
918/15/18
interleave 1,4
--- layout ----
root = ra(0,0), size 3200
swap = ra(0,6400), size 1920
usr = ra(0,10240), size 114880

I've split the data into 4 parts in order to not get too much when downloading:

1.) 29bsd-simh.tgz: A SIMH image including configuration file. "pdp11 sms1123.ini"

2.) 29bsd-smstape.tgz: A Linux dump of the QIC24 installation tape which was generated with my SMS1000 system. You can write this under Linux to a 60MB QIC tape with: "dd if=29bsd-sms-tape.dd of=/dev/st0" The SMS1000 generated format is not compatible with Linux, but the Linux dd'ed tape can be read by the SMS1000 system.

3.) 29bsd-tapefiles.tgz: The files to create a SIMH tape image, or real tape for another system.

4.) 29bsd-vtserver.tgz: The version of the vtserver and the corresponding configuration file with which I performed the successful initial installation. I worked with 19200bps, which is the maximum my SMS1000 supports on the console, under 2.9BSD only 9600bps works anyway.

Have fun with it, if you find bugs, they may of course be mine. ;)
I wish you and the community also a lot of fun with this version of 2.9BSD.
