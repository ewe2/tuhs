Being able to provide interactive help is exactly what the person who
suggested grammar-based parsing to me was working on. I hadn't even
thought about that at first. But given my recent investigation into
built-in command documentation on Unix-like systems, I tend to think
this would be a great enhancement =E2=80=93 if it was implemented with a
strict focus on not getting in the way, i.e., the user should be able
to switch it off completely, and search-as-you-type would be opt-in, if
provided at all.
