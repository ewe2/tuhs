Museo dell'Informatica Funzionante
Computer Museum in Palazzolo Acreide, Italy
http://museum.freaknet.org

Just a few lines to announce that some of our historical
computers are back online 24/7 for free use!

We have 2 VAX/VMS systems and an emulated PDP-11/34 running
RT-11 (that's the exact copy of our physical RL01 boot disk)

Have a look here, and enjoy! :)
