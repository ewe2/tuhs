Ah, thanks.

You might want to look around in the parent directory; apparently there are
two differences between the 11/34 and 11/40, other than the clock and switch
register: the stack limit register, and different handling of
segmentation-violation aborted instructions (which affects instruction
restart on stack extension).

I don't know about 2.9, maybe it knows about these. For V6, the SLR won't be
an issue; the SLR is an option on the 11/40, so not all machines had it, and
m40.s in V6 doesn't use it. The instruction restart thing sounds like it will
be an issue with running V6 on a /34.
