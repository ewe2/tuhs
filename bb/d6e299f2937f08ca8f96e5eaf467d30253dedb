Anecdata:

I=E2=80=99d had exposure to HP/UX and SunOS at university, and I used =
Minix (installed from a stack of floppies) on my 80286 PC at home.  At =
some point I accidentally dd=E2=80=99d over the DOS partition, and Minix =
became my primary OS for a year or so.

I was an avid DDJ reader (RIP) and so I=E2=80=99d seen the 386BSD =
series, but I couldn=E2=80=99t get a hold of the code for some time.  =
IIRC, my usual method was to FTP each floppy image to my university =
account (with brutal storage quotas), and then pull it down to my PC to =
write out locally.  I had an early copy of either FreeBSD or NetBSD =
(can=E2=80=99t recall which), but I think at that stage it demanded =
complete ownership of the hard disk (and didn=E2=80=99t cope with =
PC-style MBR partition tables) and I didn=E2=80=99t have a spare HDD to =
put it on.  I also seem to recall some driver issue: I didn=E2=80=99t =
have a SCSI controller, and I think I recall a problem with my MFM (or =
was it early IDE) controller?

Linux floppies (MCC?  HJ Lu?) were much easier to come by: I borrowed a =
set from someone, and re-downloaded the corrupt ones, and was able to =
install Linux beside my existing Minix installation easily.  It was very =
flakey to start with, but in a relatively short time I had X running, =
and that was the end of Minix for me.

After university, I had jobs and money, and had various Free/Net/OpenBSD =
machines, but they typically lacked support for some iffy hardware I was =
using, and fairly quickly *BSD became a second-class platform for stuff =
like Netscape, and GPU drivers, and so on.

I think a similar pattern was true for many of my era (late 80=E2=80=99s/e=
arly 90=E2=80=99s).  It was quite a bit easier to get a Linux system =
running while retaining a DOS, Windows or Minix system as a backup, and =
so that was how it evolved.

It had nothing (directly) to do with the legal issues.
