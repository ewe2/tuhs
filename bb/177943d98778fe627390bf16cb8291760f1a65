Yes and know; GCC has a number of front-ends, in various stage of
production worthiness. Besides C and C++ the Ada front end is full
production quality.  I think Fortran and Java are at lower levels; there
are also D, Go, and Pascal front ends.

There is a trend back towards compiled languages. Of note: D, Go, and Rust.

For whatever it's worth. :-)
