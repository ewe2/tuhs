I just finished Brian Kernighan's book (excellent!) and he addresses 
this in section 7.6. (Yes, he wrote the book in troff.)

He prefers "Unix" and wrote it that way except for this section. He says 
"Bell Labs' legal guardians decided that the name Unix was a valuable 
trademark that had to be protected..." Legal mostly required it to be 
used as an adjective "The UNIX TM operating system", and how the ms 
macros produced a small caps "UNIX" (and a footnote on the first 
reference). He's clear that the 1127 folks hated the requirements from 
legal.

It is true that the file which contains the kernel was /unix, or /vmunix 
for Berkeley Unix, but that's the name of the file, not the proper name 
of the operating system for English prose.  By convention, virtually all 
Unix files were in lower case.
