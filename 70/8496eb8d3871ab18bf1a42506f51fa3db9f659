Do the standards provide a way to allow mailing lists (or other kinds of
forwarders) to get around this? Maybe by having the original mail server
digitally sign the message and allowing it to be forwarded with the
signature intact. It seems like this is an important use case; why has
it been overlooked? I assume it *has* been overlooked, because the
changes I've seen have mainly consisted of an increasing number of
mailing lists simply giving up and using their own address as the From
header when the sender has this security enabled. Yahoo is the biggest
offender I've noticed, on both ends - every message I receive from Yahoo
groups does this, as do messages from Python mailing lists originally
sent by Yahoo users. I haven't, incidentally, seen any email at all from
Yahoo users on this list.
