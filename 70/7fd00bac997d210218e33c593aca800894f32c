My suntools story involves the screen lock.    Essentially this was a program that placed a large window over the entire screen to keep you from messing with the windows underneath.
You could use a hot key to inconify it but you had a fraction of a second before it opened up again.     I was working in the Pentagon one day as a consultant (I was for a brief period ron at HQ.AF.MIL) and came upon a locked console.   I asked the guy I was working for if he could unlock it or did he just want me to break the lock.    He was interested in seeing how.
Iconify, find a window, Iconify, type ps quickly, Iconify, find the process id of the lock, Iconfiy K I L L Iconfiy pid Iconfigy enter ...poof.
