I worked on the STREAMS based TCP/IP stack (at the time at Lachman
Associates but I think the code came from Convergent, not sure).
I ported it to the ETA-10 (weird machine) and also to SCO (yeah,
sorry if you have to use that mess).

I had quite a few conversations with dmr about it and he educated me
that there was STREAMS and there was streams.  His was the latter 
and it was like it was in the paper plus a few fixes.  The STREAMS
stuff was god awful.  I'm so glad that I've almost forgotten about
how awful.
