Looking at the UNIX tree chart as I do from time to time to re-search for old
UNIX, I came this time over TROPIX, which is a UNIX-like system developed from
scratch on Brazil in their "IT cold war" times.

The system is now open source and can be found at

	http://allegro.nce.ufrj.br/tropix/index.html

the pages are in Portuguese (sic) but one may get install media and the full
source code (Código Fonte).

I wonder it if would be sensible to store a copy of it on TUHS as well. In any
case, I've added it to the collection at 

	ftp://ftp.es.embnet.org/pub/misc/os/UNIX/tropix

I've run it on QEMU and it's got a somewhat distinctive look and feel (and
command set). Curious to say the least. The major drawback is that it is all
in Portuguese.
