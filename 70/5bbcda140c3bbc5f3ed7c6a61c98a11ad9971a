Subject: [pups] missing space in 2.11_rp_unknown
Message-ID: <87wux5zi02.fsf@panther.aladdin.de>

Hi,

I'm running above image with the p11 emulator, and the root partition
is almost full.
I tried to clean it up, but I cannot find where the space is used.

df says:

--------
# df
Filesystem  1K-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Mounted on
root             7816     7030      786    10%    /
--------

but looking at files, I only see 2MB+ in use:

--------
# du -s /
2702    
--------

This persists over reboots, so it doesn't seem to be a large deleted
file which is still in use.

Where is the missing space?

regards,
chris
