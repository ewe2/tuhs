Well, as someone who also reads I don't really understand how your point
relates to 80 columns.  It sounds to me that you're making an argument
for something else in which I strongly believe, which is that the block
structure of the code should be clearly visible so that a reader doesn't
have to read every line in order to understand what's going on.  As an
example, I abhor styles that say that continuations of long lines should
be indented either an extra tab or right-aligned with the first line.
Both of those styles break the visible block structure.
