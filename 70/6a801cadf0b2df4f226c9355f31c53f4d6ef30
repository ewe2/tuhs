I have used distributions in the past that maintained the traditional 
distinction.

While I've been stuck regarding bringing up a kernel, C compiler and libc 
all together, (keeping in mind my desire to avoid gcc and glibc for the 
project) the conceptual distribution I've been working on for some time 
uses more or less the same abstraction as the BSDs, with distinct /bin and 
/sbin vs. /usr/bin and /usr/sbin as I personally believe it should be, 
that the stuff in /bin should be enough to bring up and/or run diagnostics 
on a system, and everything else go in /usr.

-uso.
