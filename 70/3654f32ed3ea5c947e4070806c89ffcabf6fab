So far two respondents. I should be a little bit more explicit. I'm
after volunteers who will act as points of contact, so that other people
can submit new stuff to the archive. The volunteers could also
re-organise their subsection, and write some glue documentation so that
someone browsing the archive can make sense of it all.

So, if you have low bandwidth and/or no new files to contribute, that's
fine! Just a desire to help tidy up the existing archive and help integrate
any new material.
