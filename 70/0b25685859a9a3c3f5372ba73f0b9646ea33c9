As Mike H pointed out, Kirk has been more busy than I remembered and has been
busy in UFS, so I retract that.

That point made, I think the general point that I was making, which is that 
the Linux guys seem to be moving faster, is still valid.  I'm very fond of 
UFS and have a lot of respect for Kirk, so it's not about that, it's just 
that the energy seems to be elsewhere.  For better or worse.
