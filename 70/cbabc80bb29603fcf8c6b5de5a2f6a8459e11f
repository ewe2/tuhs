Sorry, I guess I got the timeline and the specifics mixed up (the stuff
about a non-compete agreement - I've never heard of any other company
having such a thing for their _customers_ - made me assume that there
was an attempt to actually enforce that), but it certainly seemed like
you were not very big fans of the idea of a perfect BK-to-_anything_
exporter, since then you'd lose control of the users whose metadata you
had locked up in your servers.
