I was there once myself.  The problem was fuzzy holes in the DEC-punched
fan-fold paper tape.  So I toggled in a small utility program
"wait, read, wait, punch, loop" to copy from the TTY reader to the
high-speed punch.  The sensing pins of the TTY had no trouble with the
fuzzy holes, and I got paper tapes that worked in the high-speed reader.
