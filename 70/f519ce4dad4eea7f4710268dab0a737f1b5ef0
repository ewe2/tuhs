I'll counter with Linux's /proc where everything is a string.  It's super
pleasant and I say that coming from SysV /proc where it was all a mess.

If performance is the metric, everything is a string is not so much.
If performance is not the high order bit, a /proc that you can read
with cat or grep is super pleasant.

I've had so many gnu emacs experiences like this over the years, but to the community's credit, there's fewer and fewer as time goes by.
