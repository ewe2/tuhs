Sven, you might want to look at this:

 I have hacked together a version of a Unix 5th (and 6th) 
 Edition filesystem for Linux. It is read only, and was written for 
 Linux 2.0 on an x86 and so will require a little work to install on
 other systems and newer kernels, but it is fun to be able to mount 
 old disk images.

Cheers,
