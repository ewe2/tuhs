Subject: [TUHS] Coherent running
Message-ID: <20080715152523.5d44ef57@cnb.csic.es>

Hi all,

	I just had a try to install Coherent on qemu (once more), and this time
it did work. Formerly it would fail during installation complaining about floppy
disks being unavailable, no root device or some other such error. Now it is 
happily finishing configuration using qemu 0.9.1

	So, for all of you nostalgics who wanted to have Coherent up and running
again, QEMU can finally run it since release 0.9.1. The distribution disks and
serial number for Coherent are available on a number of sites, as you may know.
