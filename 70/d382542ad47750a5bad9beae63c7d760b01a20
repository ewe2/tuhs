Based on his description of the 'HELP' command, mention of command
procedures, and talk about the manual set, I'd say VMS. VMS also had a
strong presence on Wall Street around that time.

I've always loved this story, but surely it's apocryphal? If Black Monday
had been due to an operator rebooting a VAX that would have certainly made
the news....
