  This came in handy for me too when I went the route of messed up MAXUSERS
screwage.

  I should track down the half-bezel so that I can mount this SCSI Zip drive I
have in my BA123.  That would look so weird...

  On another note, were there any SCSI adapters that made use of the BA23/
BA123 RD disk control buttons?  Would be nifty to swap in a new ra0 by
simply taking a disk offline/online.
