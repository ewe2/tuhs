Have you tried http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net ??  The README states:

  Welcome to the ex/vi port!
  ==========================

  This implementation is derived from ex/vi 3.7 of 6/7/85 and the BSD
  termcap library, originally from the 2.11BSD distribution. All of them
  were changed to compile and run on newer POSIX compatible Unix systems.
  Support for international character sets was added, including support
  for multibyte locales (based on UTF-8 or East Asian encodings), and some
  changes were made to get closer to the POSIX.2 guidelines for ex and
  vi. Some issues that were clearly bugs and not features have also been
  resolved; see the Changes file for details.

I haven't tried building it on Linux, but they claim wide platform 
portability
