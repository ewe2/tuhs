Subject: [TUHS] An amusing error message
Message-ID: <20140509210729.6D80618C09B@mercury.lcs.mit.edu>

Found in:

  http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=1BSD/s6/man.c

this minor gem:

	execl("/bin/ssp", "ssp", 0);
	execl("/usr/bin/ssp", "ssp", 0);
	printf("Can't find ssp!\n");
	execl("/bin/cat", "cat", 0);
	printf("or cat - gott in himmel!\n");
	exit(1);

Not as good as "hodie natus" (Google it if you don't know of it - it's a
classic), but mildly amusing.
