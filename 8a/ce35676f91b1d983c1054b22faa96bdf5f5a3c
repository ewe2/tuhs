I went through all the switches defined by POSIX, and figured that those 
26 could be cut down.  My concept reduced the number of switches from 26 
to 9 (FLRadfiln).  Of course, the idea is to be more minimalist than 
POSIX, so some people's opinions on what is or isn't necessary may differ 
from mine.

Of course, this changes the default behavior of ls because it no longer 
would be able to do columnar listings (|column for that).

I felt -A was a redundant "almost -a".
I felt -C and -x were redundant because a tool like column(1) could be 
used to do the same job (even though column(1) isn't POSIX).
I felt -H was a redundant "almost -L".
I felt -S, -r and -t could be implemented in other ways using sort(1).
I felt -c and -u were meaningless, but that's because of the filesystems I 
usually work with that do not have functional equivalents.  -u for one is 
completely useless on VFAT even though it has such timestamps!  YMMV.
I felt -g and -o could be replaced by cut(1).
I felt -k wasn't really all that important.  Just halve the numbers.
I felt -m wasn't really all that important.  There's other ways to convert 
to that format, no doubt, through filters.
I felt -p was a redundant "almost -F".
I felt -q could be done just fine with something like tr(1).
I felt -s was a redundant "kindasorta -l".
And -1 becomes the new default, so it's redundant. ;)

Again, YMMV. ;)

-uso.
