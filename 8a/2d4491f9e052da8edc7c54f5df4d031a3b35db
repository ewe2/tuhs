I'd like a $repo/src/STATE file filled out at the end of my day.  Back in
the day I had a coworker that would do a 

	find /home/bk/lm -maxdepth 3 -name STATE -mtime -1

in the morning to see what I had been up to :)

The act of dumping what I was trying to do, what I had figured out so far,
just dumping state, frequently lead to the solution.  So it had the "bad"
effect of making me work longer to actually finish.

I've worked on problems in the kernel that were hard enough that it could
take me as much as 8 hours of thinking to get back to where I was yesterday.
The STATE file came out of that, it ramped me up faster.
