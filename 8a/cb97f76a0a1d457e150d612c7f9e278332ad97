Subject: [TUHS] booting 4.3-Quasijarus on SIMH VAX
Message-ID: <slrna5qlch.41s.mirian@trantor.cosmic.com>

I've managed to boot the latest 4.3-Quasijarus0a on Bob Supnik's SIMH
VAX emulator.  SIMH emulates a MicroVAX 3000, which is one of the
currently supported configurations in 4.3-Quasijarus.

The way I did it was:

First I installed NetBSD 1.5.2/vax on the VAX emulator.  I used this to
label and newfs the root/usr diskimage for 4.3-Q (it is important to use
the -O option to newfs so that NetBSD will create a 4.3-style
filesystem.  (In all cases, I used RA90 disk images, which are nice and
spacious and which both netbsd and 4.3-Q seem to work well with.)  Then
I restored the root and usr filesystems from the 4.3-Q distribution onto
these diskimages, and used the /usr/mdec/installboot command in NetBSD
to install the bootblock onto the root diskimage.  I created an fstab
for it, and also commented out everything in rc* having to do with the
network (there's no network device support in SIMH VAX yet).  I also
commented out all gettys listed in /etc/ttys except for console.

Speaking of console, it's important to use something which is as close
to a VT-100 as possible.  I've been using rxvt, which is pretty good.

It seems to be important to disable the RL controller ("set rl disabled"
in SIMH) when booting the GENERIC kernel.  Otherwise, you get a page
fault and panic on boot.  (I haven't tracked the cause of this down
yet).  The GENERIC kernel also expects there to be images on ra0, ra1
and ra2 (which are rq0, rq1 and rq1 in SIMH, respectively).

I can get the system to come up in multiuser mode, and I can log in as
root.  Unfortunately, though, after a few seconds, the system locks up
with 

uda0: lost interrupt
uba0: reset uda0    
uda0: DMA burst size set to 4
ra0: uda0, unit 0, size = 2376153 sectors

Typing ^E to get to the SIMH prompt, and single-stepping the emulator
shows it is stuck in the idle loop.  At this point, nothing short of
shutting down SIMH has any effect.

Any thoughts on what might be going wrong?  The complete log is included
below:
