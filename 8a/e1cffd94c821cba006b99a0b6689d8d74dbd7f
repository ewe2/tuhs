I doubt Microsoft would have made it without Xenix on their backoffice, and it was not only UNIX that inspired the changes in MS-DOS 3 and OS/2 to make it more UNIX like, but had inspired Cutler to make the next VMS written in C to be portable.  Maybe we'd be in a far more Vax dominated world with more Digital inspired mid range kit, or something else would have filled the void to deliver us from a single vendor.
