Oh joy! :-)

As others have mentioned, it could be problems with /tmp protection, as 
well as checking if there actually is any free space there.

You need to know what code the key you call "backspace" actually sends. 
I suspect it is not sending a backspace, but a DEL (DEL is actually the 
traditional character used to delete, BS is a modern perversion).

For the messages, I'm not sure what you are thinking of. Is it the ones 
before boot time, or is there some other messages that you see?

As for the ^E, that is configured in simh when running.

2.11BSD won't make a difference. You'll see the same result. This is a 
problem because you are running under DOS. It is the DOS screen handler 
that needs to understand whatever codes are output by the programs 
running inside simh. In this case, the program inside simh thinks it is 
connected to a VT100 (or xterm, or something similar), and sends escape 
codes based on that. I don't know why it thinks so, but I suspect you 
told the system by setting the TERM variable. Please set it to something 
that matches reality, or else fix reality. :-)
