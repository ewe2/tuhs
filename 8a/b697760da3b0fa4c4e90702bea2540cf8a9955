Of course, I assume the answer to the question of why everyone didn't do
that is that there's a trade-off: We take for granted today that you
can't change a line in the middle of a text file without moving
everything after it, either by reading the whole thing into memory and
writing back the changed version, or creating a copy of the file with
the changes and replacing the original with it afterwards, but I assume
these "deck of cards" style files had provisions for editing one in the
middle. You also can't seek to a given line number in a file.
