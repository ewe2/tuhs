That SPF shows a date of 1987.   Masscomp was '83 for the FP and 84 for the
APU and I know we could not get them - but then again KO was mad at us.  At
that point we had more of the 780 HW guys then DEC did, plus a bunch of
ex-VMS and ex-LDP folks.   The nasty-gram letter from Ken was framed and
hung out the office of one of the VPs (I wonder if Palmer of one of the
other Masscomp pack rats still has a picture of it).

I know we tried to get it for our Vax, and it was a clear - no way.
