The first Unix I used was PC/ix on an XT. I don=E2=80=99t know it even =
had vi, but it had INed, which I assume was the ISC evolution of NED & =
Rand Editor. (I think I first started using vi on Xenix on an AT before =
I got my own RT??)

Anyway, I had been very productive with half-duplex editing on 3270 on =
CMS up to that point, and INed seemed very natural to me.

Totally unrelated to Unix, when I came to IBM Austin from Yorktown, real =
3270s were scarce/shared. I got a DisplayWriter with a 3270 card and =
emulator in my office. That was better than a real 3270 to my tastes, =
even with the 8=E2=80=9D diskettes. 3270 emulation on PC was ok, but not =
as good as the real thing, certainly not as good as the DW emulation.=20
