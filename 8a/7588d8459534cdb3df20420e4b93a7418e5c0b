This is pretty cool. Can you post links for this and the 3B2 emulator?

I had one for a few years at Georgia Tech and I *loved* the keyboard.
It was a huge productivity boost being able to have multiple windows.

We used them connected to our Vax 11/780 with 4 Meg of memory running
4.[12] BSD (don't remember which) and having multiple DMD 5620s
with multiple windows open on each drove the poor vax to its knees...
