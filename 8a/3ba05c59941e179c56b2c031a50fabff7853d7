I would be interested to know if there is any chance of getting a hobbyist 
A/UX license out of Apple.  It would be even better if one also got source 
code, but I also have a hankering for an Aeronautical Pigs Aerobatics Team in 
the RNZAF - pigs taken out of pig farms and taught to fly, of course -, and 
that is far more likely to happen ... ;)
