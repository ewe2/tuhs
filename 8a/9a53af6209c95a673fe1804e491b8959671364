I have a few Netcom boxes at home.  I'll try to remember to look
at what models when I go home.

That would depend on the OS more than the hardware.  :-)

There were backplanes like that for the two card RL controller.

I may be wrong (but I am sure someone here will correct me) but if the
backplane is designed for the two card RL controller I think it will be 18
bit and not capable of 22 bit.

I would guess you could look at it and see how many bits are wired thru.
And, if you have a clear view of the wirewrap side you should be able to
see if it has two A-B-C-D slots in the middle.  Difference in wirewrap
pattern will be obvious.  :-)

What floppy controller?  Dec didn't use the standard Shugart 8" inteface
for RX01/RX02 disks.  If it is like the Terak which also used 801's you
are going to need to find drivers for what OS you decide to use.  Good
luck with that.

You might try asking on alt.sys.pdp11 as there are a lot much more
knowlegable people than I active over there.
