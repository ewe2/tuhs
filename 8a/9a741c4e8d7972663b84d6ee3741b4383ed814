Subject: [TUHS] Apple IIe Unix?
Message-ID: <c2d6b3fa-df83-5efe-03a7-77b09bc82667@gmail.com>

Hi All,

So, I'm about to get my very own Apple IIe and while it's an incredibly 
versatile machine for assembly language and hardware hackery, I'm not 
aware of any Unices that run on the machine, natively. Does anybody know 
of any from back in the day?

It's got a 65c02 processor and somewhere around 128k of RAM, but it's 
also pretty expandable w/7 slots and a huge amount of literature about 
how to do stuff w/those slots.

Thanks,

Will
