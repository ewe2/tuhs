to the /usr device.
> Much later in the 80ths much more disk space was available and a separate /home was created. Exacly when I don't know, but there was no /home in Ed. 7 but System V release 3 had it already.

4.3 BSD had it, as I found out, after login in a few sconds ago. 4.3BSD was released in June 1986. Thus the /home appeared in between 1979 (Ed 7) and 1986.
