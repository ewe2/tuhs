g, h and i are members of structures, the pointer of which is returned by t=
he preceding function call. They have to be defined as pointers to function=
s returning a pointer to the following structure.=20

A simple example is:

typedef	struct	Node	Node;

struct Node
{
	Node	*(*f)(void);
};

void
main(void)
{
	Node *p;
=09
	p->f()->f()->f();
	call();
	(*((*((*p->f)()->f))())->f)();=20
}
// (*((*((*((*f)()->g))()->h))()->i))()
