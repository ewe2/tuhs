I believe so (I don't recall seeing any other UTF-8-related weirdness
for a very long time), but I would want to verify the behavior on a
system that doesn't have a gazillion customizations accumulated over
years _and_ has the most recent version of coreutils before I file an
actual bug report. (It's not like Debian is ever bleeding edge, to
begin with.) I'll see if I spin up a VM or three one of these days to
check.
