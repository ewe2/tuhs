Subject: Installing SYSTEM III; stuck!
Message-ID: <000624211802.2620014a@trailing-edge.com>

OK, I think I'm figuring out how to install Unix System III on a
11/45.  In particular, I mount the first tape on a MT tape drive, get
a RP04 up and spinning, and boot from tape:

UNIX tape boot loader
UNIX -- Initial Load: Tape-to-Disk

The type of disk drive on which the Root file system will reside,
as well as the type of tape drive that will be used for Tape 1
must be specified below.

Answer the questions with a 'y' or 'n' followed by
a carriage return or line feed.
There is no type-ahead -- wait for the question to complete.
The character '@' will kill the entire line,
while the character '#' will erase the last character typed.

RP03 at address 176710?: n
RP04/5/6 at address 176700?: y
Drive number (0-7)?: 0
Disk drive 0 selected.

Mount a formatted pack on drive 0.
Ready?: y

TU10/TM11 at address 172520?: y
Drive number (0-7)?: 0
Tape drive 0 selected.

The tape on drive 0 will be read from the current position
at 800bpi, 5120 characters (10 blocks) per record,
and written onto the pack on drive 0 starting at block 0.

Ready?: y
Size of filesystem to be copied is 6000 blocks.
What is the pack volume label? (e.g. p0001): p0001
The pack will be labelled p0001.
The boot block for your type of disk drive will now be installed.

The file system copy is now complete.

To boot the basic unix for your disk and tape drives
as indicated above, mount this pack on drive 0
and read in the boot block (block 0) using
whatever means you have available; see romboot(8), 70boot(8).

Then boot the program unixhptm using diskboot(8).
Normally:  #0=unixhptm

The system will initially come up single-user; see init(8).
If you have an upper case only console terminal,
you must execute: stty lcase; see stty(1).

After UNIX is up, link the file unixhptm to unix using ln(1).
        # ln /unixhptm /unix

Set the date(1).

Good Luck!

The tape will now be rewound.


[Now I boot from the RP04]:

#0=unixhptm

drwxr-xr-x   2 sys      sys           32 Aug 19 08:46 usr

But what do I do next?  There's a bunch of 5120-byte-record files still
on the tape, and the "/bin" on the root filesystem doesn't have "tar" or
"restor". It *does* have cpio, and I think that's what I want to use.  So
what's the next step?

From the PDP-11 SysIII in the archive, the files are cpio archives. The
/usr/src/man/docs/setup file explains what to do next. It's in nroff
format, but I don't know what macro switch to use to print it out
correctly. I'll send it in a separate e-mail to avoid clogging up the list.
