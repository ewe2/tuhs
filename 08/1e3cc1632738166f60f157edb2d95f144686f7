Speaking of Bill Joy, I remember going to a Unix group meeting at SRI sometime
in late 1977 or early 1978. I was working for Ford Aerospace, an early
commercial Unix adopter. I don't remember who was speaking, but at the end of
the talk somebody from the back of the auditorium asked a very deep
intelligent question. The person speaking was quite taken back by the quality
of the question, and asked who the person was. The person said "I'm Bill Joy,
a graduate student at Berkeley".

The rest is history.
