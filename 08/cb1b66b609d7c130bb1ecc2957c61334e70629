I noticed that after the mount the directory bits where not set on the
mount point (which I thought was odd).

If the resulting node does not have the directory bits set, you can
get "Bad directory" from the shell.

something in the mode bits in the root of the fs?  

(I have not looked at the fs structure, but I'll take a look today since
it's raining here and I won't be watching soccer or baseball)
