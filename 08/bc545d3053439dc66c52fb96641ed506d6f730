You have a point there. UX/RT will still obviously need to retain the
readlink() function (since compatibility with conventional Unix will
be a major feature, and it's also convenient to have a single function
to get the target of a link), although it could be implemented with a
normal read underneath. Same with opendir(), readdir(), and the like,
which I was definitely planning on implementing with normal reads
(under BSD they seem to already be implemented that way).
