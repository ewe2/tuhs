Subject: [TUHS] Help about a DATA GENERAL ECLIPSE MV-7800 with DG-UX
Message-ID: <20050420123800.GD5119@freaknet.org>


Hi all,

we recently received this fantastic machine for our 
computer museum. 

We need some help because we can't find any documentation 
about the "console cable", to connect a tty terminal 
to it, and make it boot (or test the cpu, or whatever)

we think we have only a part of the manuals, so we can't 
make progress booting it and we don't want to make
casual testing ...

can someone help?

some documentation images can be found here:

http://dyne.org/~asbesto/missionecompiuta1/
http://dyne.org/~asbesto/missionecompiuta2/
http://dyne.org/~asbesto/missionecompiuta3/

sorry for some crazy and funny images - we are really
crazy people :D
