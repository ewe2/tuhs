I'm not sure what your design is that you're more than a screen away
from either its declaration, a stat call, or the fact that it's got size
_and_ mode _and_ mtime etc.

And if you do that, why stop there? Why not require the type to be
repeated to dereference any pointer?

while(*x == 0)

is x a pointer to int, to char, to another pointer, etc?
