Subject: [pups] Change of PUPS list address
Message-ID: <200105030219.f432Jnl10761@henry.cs.adfa.edu.au>

All,
	The machine which hosts the pups mailing list,
minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au, is going to change its domain name in mid-July.

To help alleviate any problems, I have taken out a separate domain,
and have put in aliases to the current minnie address, and will migrate
the aliases to the new address when the time comes.

So, if possible could you send e-mail to the pups mailing list
using the address

	pups at tuhs.org

from now on.

Thanks,
	Warren Toomey	wkt at tuhs.org
