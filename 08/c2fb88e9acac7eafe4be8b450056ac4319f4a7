I think some answers could be find in "Practice of Programming" by Rob Pike
and Brian Kernighan.  In the section about comments they express why they
are not big fans of verbose commenting style.

They also state: "Comments are meant to help the reader of a program.  They
do not help by saying things the code already plainly says, or by
contradicting the code, or by distracting the reader with elaborate
typographical displays.  The best comments aid the understanding of a
program by briefly pointing out salient details or by providing a
larger-scale view of the proceedings."
