This is generally referred to as the weak host model (or End System),
as opposed to the strong host model.  See RFC 1122, sect 3.3.4.2.

That is not my understanding.  Either protocol can use either model in
a given system.  In theory it could even differ depending upon configurations.

Most systems I've worked on have used the weak model, but that is largely,
because they were routers, and looked up destinations in a FIB (or RIB)
before (or as well as) considering interface addresses.

Some OS's I've used followed the weak scheme, some followed the strong
scheme.

The following suggests that Linux defaults to weak, and that BSDs
default to strong; I've never tested that BSD case, but from memory
OSX (xnu) defaults to weak.
