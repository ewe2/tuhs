FWIW, I do most of my programming these days in Elixir.  It's a =
functional
programming language with pervasive pattern matching, Rubyish syntax, =
and
Lispish macros.  It runs on the Erlang virtual machine, so it has a good
story for Actor-based concurrency, distribution, etc.  For details, see:

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_(programming_language)

Anyway, compilation is mostly handled by Lispish macros, so it can =
support
some fairly cool metaprogramming.  In particular, I can write things =
like:

out_map =3D inp_list     |>
Enum.filter(filter_fn) |>
Enum.map(map_fn)       |>
Enum.reduce(%{}, reduce_fn)

Piped values are handed in as the first argument to each function and =
most
functions expect this behavior.  For extra credit, there is a set of =
Stream
functions (really, macros) that process one element at a time and handle
errors in a reasonable manner.
