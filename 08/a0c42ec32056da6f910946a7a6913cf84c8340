Nemo Nusquam:

  Borenstein wrote a book ("Programming as if people mattered: Friendly 
  Programs, Software Engineering, and Other Noble Delusions") in which he 
  mused about W and X and Andrew.  (A very nice read but horribly 
  expensive -- fortunately I bought it when PUP had reasonably priced 
  paperbacks.)

abebooks.com is your friend here.  I just bought a used paperback copy
for about USD 15 including shipping to Canada.  There are others of
similar price.  Shipping to the US is probably a little cheaper.
There's at least one copy available from a seller in the UK as
well (and doubtless some from other countries if you dig further
in the listings).

For those who don't know, ABE is a central place for independent
booksellers, including used-book shops, to sell online.  You get
a good deal and support a worthwhile small business (not just ABE
but the individual selling shop) at the same time.
