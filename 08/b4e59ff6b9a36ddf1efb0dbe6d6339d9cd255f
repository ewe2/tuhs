Very interesting.

I want to figure out how to make a multi-line banner.  (In Sendmail.)

I feel like your greet_pause was more than 10 seconds, but so be it. 
Still shouldn't be a problem.

I've wondered about a more featureful syslog daemon that could pattern 
match and watch for the log message for pre-greeting traffic, and 
forward them to a script that would dynamically update an RBL.  I just 
haven't found enough round-tuits yet.

Interesting work.  I'd be curious to see how you're doing some of that 
and think about implementing it myself.

Thanks for sharing Dave.
