I recall having an IBM PC port of UNIX in the 1980s on floppy with a 
black 6x9 box and Charlie Chaplin with the red rose. I thought it was 
called AIX. I installed it, and recall it being very different from UNIX 
for sysadmin (different logs, different admin commands) but similar for 
users. I thought it was based on System III or thereabouts.

I can't find any evidence of this. It appears AIX 1.0 wasn't for the 
original PC.

Does anyone else recall this distribution and what it was called or 
based on?

Thanks,

     Mary Ann
