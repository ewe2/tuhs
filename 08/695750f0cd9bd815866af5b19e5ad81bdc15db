Yes, it would put more complexity into the kernel, but maybe it is =
conceptually elegant.

Consider a classic pipe or a socket and the behaviour of read(2) for =
those objects. The behaviour of read(2) that Doug proposes for a file =
would make it in line with that for a classic pipe or a socket. Hence, =
maybe it should not be a mode, but the standard behaviour.

I often think that around 1981 the Unix community missed an opportunity =
to really think through how networking should integrate with the =
foundations of Unix. It seems to me that at that time there was an =
opportunity to merge files, pipes and sockets into a coherent, simple =
framework. If the 8th edition file-system-switch had been introduced =
already in V6 or V7, maybe this would have happened.

On the other hand, the installed base was probably already too large in =
1981 to still make breaking changes to core concepts. V7 may have been =
the last chance saloon for that.
