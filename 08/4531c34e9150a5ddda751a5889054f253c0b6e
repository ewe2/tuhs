Subject: [pups] 2.11BSD "make unix" aborts Error 141
Message-ID: <200303191652.h2JGqqVJ025026@minnie.tuhs.org>

Steven M. Schultz:

	It's the exit status of the assembler.   On _some_ modules, the 
	assembler ('as') jumps off into the weeds and executes an 'exit'
	system call with a non-zero value in R0.   141 is a lower case 'a'
	as I recall.

0141 (octal) is 'a.  141 decimal is 0215 octal, i.e. carriage return with
parity.

What seems more likely is that 141 decimal is 0200 + 13 decimal.  If a
simple value returned by wait, that means SIGPIPE + core image, which
seems unlikely.  If an exit status as displayed by the shell, it just
means SIGPIPE (128 + signal number).  Or is signal 13 different in 2.11
than in V7?  (That seems even less likely.)

SIGPIPE doesn't seem entirely unreasonable as an accident that could
happen if something goes wrong in the assembly-language-code-tweaking
part of the kernel build.

Of course if it's a random value handed to sys exit, all rules are off.
