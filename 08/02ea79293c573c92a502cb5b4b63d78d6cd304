Warren Toomey <wkt@tuhs.org> asks on Sat, 29 Sep 2018 09:04:44 +1000 for
a copy of the  original 1972/73 paper on The UNIX TIME-SHARING SYSTEM
that was published at the SOSP bProceedings of the fourth ACM
symposium on operating system principles.

The URL in this entry from unix.bib works for me:

@InProceedings{Ritchie:1973:UTSa,
  author =       "Dennis M. Ritchie and Ken Thompson",
  editor =       "{ACM}",
  booktitle =    "Fourth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles,
                 IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights,
                 New York, October 15-17, 1973",
  title =        "The {UNIX} time-sharing system",
  publisher =    pub-ACM,
  address =      pub-ACM:adr,
  pages =        "??--??",
  year =         "1973",
  bibdate =      "Thu Feb 23 07:01:17 2017",
  bibsource =    "http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/unix.bib",
  URL =          "https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/cacm.html",
  acknowledgement = ack-nhfb,
  remark =       "This electronic edition of this paper is a reprint of
                 the version appearing in The Bell System Technical
                 Journal 57 no. 6, part 2 (July--August 1978). In turn,
                 that was a revised version of an article that appeared
                 in Communications of the ACM, 17, No. 7 (July 1974),
                 pp. 365--375. That article was a revised version of a
                 paper presented at the Fourth ACM Symposium on
                 Operating Systems Principles, IBM Thomas J. Watson
                 Research Center, Yorktown Heights, New York, October
                 15--17, 1973. Most of the differences between versions
                 occur between the C. ACM version and the BSTJ printing;
                 we incorporated updated numbers and material on
                 portability.",
