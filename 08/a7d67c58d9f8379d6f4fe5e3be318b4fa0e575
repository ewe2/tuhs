Cfront has been released as historic source by AT&T, though
I haven't found the license, the code is here:

	http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/c_plus_plus

I am currently trying to awaken Cfront 3.03 - more an issue
of understanding it than repairing bitrot. If anyone
has any bugifxes or additional tools for cfront they would be
willing to share I would be very interested.

I will post again if/when I get it all to work.

Thanks

-Steve
