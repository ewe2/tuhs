Also the often seen C paradigm of using "enum bla" in prototypes
results in C++ compilation warnings/errors if the enum is actually
used to define flags rather than a true enumeration, and there are
not "bit enumerations" which would accomplish that.  So you need
to use an integer for the prototype and have lost all checking
capabilities with a glance.  I have never understood this
deficiency.
