Something I've been meaning to ask for a while: why Unix and octal on the
PDP-11? Because of the DEC documentation?

I understand why other DEC architectures (e.g. PDP-7) were octal: 18b is
a multiple of 3. But PDP-11 is 16b, multiple of 4.

After all, Unix had its own assembler, so was there a need/reason to
use octal?

Cheers, Warren
