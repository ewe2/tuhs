Subject: [TUHS] HP Apollo Series 400 and DOMAIN/OS...
Message-ID: <20071221100913.GA26408@freaknet.org>


Hi! 

We just recovered an HP APOLLO Series 400 in our computer museum, 
and we got the installation tapes of DOMAIN/OS. It seem a very
particular flavour of BSD 5.3. We also made a dump of the
tapes, to preserve it. :D

Does someone know more about it? What about licensing? Is
it covered by some sort of hobbyist license? 

Kisses to everybody! :)
