The code has been implemented in a way that mainly differs in that "ifconfig" 
needs to be called with "ifconfig <ifname> plumb" before you can use the 
interface. 

In former times, sockets have been emulated in userland, but this prevents a 
socket filedescriptor returned from a dup(sockfd) to work as expected. As a 
result, POSIX later required sockets to be an integral part of the 
implementation and sockets went into the kernel again.

BTW: there was a paper from Sun that explains that sockets are faster then 
using the STREAMS based t_open() and friends.
