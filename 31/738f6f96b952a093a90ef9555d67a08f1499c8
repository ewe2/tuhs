No point here, other than showing the size of sam in its native Plan 9 habi=
tat.

ehg% size /bin/sam /bin/aux/samterm
 95,514t +  8,764d + 75,868b =3D 180,146	/bin/sam
145,093t + 28,708d + 59,508b =3D 233,309	/bin/aux/samterm

The size gives me a better idea of the code complexity. For completeness, h=
ere's the size of vi on my Mac.

bwc-downtown:~ bwc$ size /usr/bin/vi
__TEXT		__DATA	__OBJC	others		dec		hex
1,585,152	163,840	0	4,295,012,352	4,296,761,344	1001b6000
=09
Good thing the Mac has shared libraries? (Commas added for clarity)

Again, no point, other than a data point.
