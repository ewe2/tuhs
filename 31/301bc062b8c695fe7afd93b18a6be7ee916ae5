I remember some discussion about this.  In reality, a C comment
really requires you to type 8 characters, because putting anything
adjacent to the /* or */ looks terrible.  Many languages used single
characters (e.g., # for make).  The argument was "if you make
comments easier to type, you'll get more of them in the code"  (viz.
the Unix kernel).  I'm guessing Bjarne was aware of these
discussions, although I don't remember specifically that he was...

 You could just drop a note to Bjarne Stroustrup and ask. :-)
