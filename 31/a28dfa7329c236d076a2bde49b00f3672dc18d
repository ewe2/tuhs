Hello everyone,

I'm Wojciech Adam Koszek and I'm a new member here. After a short stint =
with Red Hat 6.0 and Slackware Linux around 2000-2001 (I think it was =
Slackware 7.0 or 7.1) my journey with UNIX started with FreeBSD 4.5. I =
fell in love with BSD and through Warner Losh, Robert Watson, and folks =
from a Polish UNIX scene, I became hooked. I ended up working with =
FreeBSD for the following 15 years or so.

Anyway: the volume of the UNIX literature back then in Poland was =
scarce, yet through a small bookstore and a friendly salesman I got =
myself a "UNIX Network Programming Volume 1" at a huge discount, and =
read it back-to-back.=20

Looking back, his books had a huge impact on my life (I had all his =
books, and read everything line by line, with a slight exception of =
TCP/IP illustrated vol 2, which I used as a reference), and while =
Stevens's website sheds some light on what he did, I often wonder what =
is the story behind how his books came to be. It doesn't help he =
appeared a very private person--never have I seen a photo of him =
anywhere.

What was the reception of his books in the US?

Did you know him? Do you know any more details about what he did after =
1990?

Thanks and take care,

Wojciech Adam Koszek=
