Yeah that's the extent of it.  trust me I was shocked when I tried to
dd a Xenix install, and Qemu booted it right up.  But without a C
compiler it's useless.  I should add that the TCP/IP supported like 3
NIC's... so even *if* you could find it..... it'd be limited.  You can
get the disk to work though.... But not under Qemu, Virtual PC and
VMWare can use it.

The 'issue' is that simply Xenix's method of detecting disk density
doesn't work under any emulator because while it's trying the wrong
thing it will 'work' when it shouldnt...

if you are trying to load a 3 1/5" high density disk, the device is
2/60
Low density is
2/36

so change the device for fd0 to be either....  or even symlink it.

For what it's worth, running it under Virtual PC is fast, however the
console is kind of screwed up.. Xenix uses a nonstandard screen mode
(well for virtual pc's bios that is).

I used to have Microsoft Word for Xenix... in the box and everything.
I'll be dammed if I know where it is. I wish I had managed to keep the
license cards.... :|

And no, outside of a picture from an ad talking about the PDP-11
version of Xenix, and one anicdote in USENET saying that any issues
they had were traced back to Microsoft additions to the system...
there is no trace of it.

But then who knows, maybe someone will post back with something.
