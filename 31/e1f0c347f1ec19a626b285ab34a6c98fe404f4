I dunno what "used in anger" means but it worked.  I used it.  I know
Joltiz pretty well, he worked for me around this time period.  I hired
him just to give him some money, he had gotten sort of screwed by the
in crowd in the BSD/Usenix world, I didn't see that as reasonable.

Yep.  Leading to the famous (to me) quote: The BSD guys can't decide
who is going to drive the big red fire truck so they each get to drive
their very own toy fire truck.  (I think Linus said that but not sure).
