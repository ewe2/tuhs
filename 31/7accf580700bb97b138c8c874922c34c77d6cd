Let's not forget the latency. 128ms of latency over modems was
awesomely low... That changed relatively little, even as the speeds
went from 1200 baud up to 57.6k.

While I am nostalgic for my early coding days on a 1200 baud video
screen and a 300 baud printer, I do not miss the speed or the latency
issues...
