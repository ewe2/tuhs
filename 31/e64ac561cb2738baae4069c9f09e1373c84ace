You need more than just the drive - you need a compatible controller.  While
most floppy systems were DEC-compatible in SSSD and SSDD modes (RX01 and RX02),
the DEC RX03 (DSDD) was never released and as a result there are literally
dozens of not-quite-compatible DSDD floppy systems.  When the low-level
format agrees, you'll discover that the interleaving doesn't!  (And there
are a lot more choices with regards to interleaving when you've got two
sides...)

If you can clue us in as to the make and model of the writing controller,
it'd help a lot.

I'm sure I've got a couple dozen not-quite-compatible DSDD systems here
in DC :-).
