Nope, I can boot a 7.03 monitor and it understands Y2K and higher. I had 
to edit SYSTAT.MAC to make it print the currect year after 2000, but 
everything else just worked.

I believe a 6.03A monitor also behaves correctly.

Although, I believe the year is coming soon when it will implode and 
wrap back around. I don't recall the specifics of that.
