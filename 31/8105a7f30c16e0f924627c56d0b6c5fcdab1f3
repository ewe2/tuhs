I have an 11/2 card :)  It used to control the concrete mixing silos at the
company my father used to work for.  Came with 2x RX02.  I encountered RX02
disks I could not rotate in their sleeve anymore.  Too much sand and grit :)
Just cleaned the heads and vacumed out all the cement.  Worked just fine
ever after (in fact, it also worked fine with the cement & grit & whatever
:)
