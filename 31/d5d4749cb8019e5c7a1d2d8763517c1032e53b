I sent a message to the Mailman users mailing list inquiring.  I believe 
that at least dmarc_moderation_action should be set to munge to best 
deal with DMARC.

I also feel like mailing lists are their own entity, and as such, 
messages should be from them.  Similarly, I think replies should be 
directed back to the list.  I think this is especially true for 
discussion type mailing lists.  Thus, I would be inclined to set 
from_is_list to munge also.

I feel like the best long term solution would be for remove_dkim_headers 
to be set to yes, which will remove the DKIM headers if the from header 
is being munged.

I've been using DNSSEC for multiple years and have had very few problems 
with it.  Usually it's because I hand edit my zone and bork something.

I also look forward to the encryption ~> privacy that DNS over DTLS will 
provide (as I understand it) but I wonder what additional protection 
DTLS will provide compared to what DNSSEC provides.
