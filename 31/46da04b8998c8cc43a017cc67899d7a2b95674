This is where I am out of my depth, was it a "success" before the
mid-late '80s as some dominant force?  My reading is no outside
universities with UNIX/BSD.  The meteoric success came a bit later in
the '80s with NSFNET, the rise of Cisco, and then the internet
exchange culture in the early '90s CIX, PAIX, Metropolitan Fiber
Systems etc got us to today and off Bell System stuff.
