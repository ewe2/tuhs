Subject: [TUHS] So I'm looking through some old SVR3.1 source
Message-ID: <BA8E7D4A-23F4-41AC-8B5E-EC653E9D0830@kdbarto.org>

Just cuz of this list and recent comments about SVRx and I see this comment in ftrap.s

fpreent:			    # this is the point we return to 
				    # when we are executing the n+1th
				    # floating point instruction in a
				    # contiguous sequence of floating
				    # point instructions (floating
				    # pointlessly forever?)


Makes me wonder how many other humorous comments are buried in the code.

Oh, if no one out there has a SVR3.1 distribution (apparently for the 3b2), I’ve got one to send out….
