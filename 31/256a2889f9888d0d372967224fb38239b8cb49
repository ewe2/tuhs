Following the recent discussion on this list about early paging systems =
and John Reiser=E2=80=99s work in this area, I succeeded in reaching out =
to him. It is all very long ago, but John=E2=80=99s recollection is that =
his paging system work was initially done late in 1979 or maybe 1980. =
This matches with Rob Pike=E2=80=99s memory of seeing it demoed in early =
1981.

John=E2=80=99s recollection confirms that his design implemented mmap =
and copy-on-write, and was integrated with the file buffer cache (all =
features that Norman Wilson also remembered).

I have appended John=E2=80=99s message below (with permission). I am not =
sure I understand - at this time - how John=E2=80=99s code was =
multiplexing page table entries with kernel data structures beyond what =
is mentioned, but I think it might be an interesting summer project to =
see how much of the design can be resurrected using related code, old =
documents and memories.
