Way back in the deep past - late 70s I think - The Computer Science =
Department at Strathclyde  Uni in Scotland had a contract to develop a =
test suite generator for the C compiler on the ICL perq computer.  I =
think the testing/development for that compiler was happening at =
Dalkeith in Scotland - but dont quote me.

Like the above we generated programs (e.g. mixing short, int, long =
signed and unsigned and doing all sort of ops on them).  The expected =
output was computed by the same C program running on a BSD unix vax and =
something else.  We had a few issues with the vax and the other system =
disagreeing on the arithmetic results, but generally we were confident =
the random C programs would reasonably test the system under test.  We =
did not get to see the results of the tests,  we developed the suite and =
handed it over to ICL.

Overall we were not impressed by the PERQ and on a trip to Rutherford =
Appleton Labs (RAL) one November there was a HUGE bonfire being prepared =
(for our Guy Falkes(sp) celebration).  The bonfire was generally =
comprised of the PERQ cardboard packing cases.  It just looked like they =
were planning to burn the PERQs themselves.  We agreed with the =
sentiment.=
