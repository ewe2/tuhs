Hoi,

thanks to everyone helping me with links.

As you already mentioned:

The best I could find was this paper by DMR:

https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qedman.html

There he writes:

	Sequences of two or more addresses are separated either by "," or
	by ";". In the latter case "." is set to the preceding address
	before the succeeding address is evaluated. The semicolon is used
	mostly to control the starting line for context searches. =



Later in the bootstrapping explanation appears a command with an
address chain:

	O;/./;.mf	"move filename (if there) to bf

I couldn't really understand this stuff. It seems to be specific to
this version of qed and the underlying operating system. Nevermind,
this leaves my focus of interest.


More was I curious about the documentation of address chains in
books.

- ``The Unix Programming Environment'' does neither mention
address chains nor semicolon separators.

- SRB's ``The Unix System'' (an often overlooked but great book)
explains the semicolon separator in a one-paragraph section on page
33.

- ``Software Tools'' goes into the most detail that I could find.
On pages 170 f. (section 6.2) it explains the semicolon separator
and address chains with this example:

	/#/;//;//;//;//p

	prints from the third succeeding line containing # to the
	fourth, inclusive.

Right thereafter (pages 172 and 173; section 6.3) the
implementation of getlist() -- collect line numbers -- follows,
which, as expected, is in a similar style as the actual
implementation in Unix at that time (v6):

	See function commands()
