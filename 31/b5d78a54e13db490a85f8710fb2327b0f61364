OK, for those who haven't heard it before...

There was a meeting at Bell Labs.  One women came in late, all out of 
breath.  She apologized: "I'm so sorry I'm late, but I was grepping my 
apartment for my keys."

One of the senior UNIX guys in the meeting responded dryly:  "You should 
have used egrep, it's faster."
