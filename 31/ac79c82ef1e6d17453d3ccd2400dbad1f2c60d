Subject: [TUHS] SCO vs. IBM: NOVELL steps up to the plate
Message-ID: <200305281925.h4SJPYJ8078685@minnie.tuhs.org>

Interesting.  I suggest everyone interested in this fracas read the
whole scoop at (to repeat Kenneth Stailey's pointer)

  http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/2003/05/pr03033.html

Here's a question of interest not to the Linux community but to
the TUHS one: if, as Novell now claim, the 1995 agreement didn't
convey the UNIX copyrights to SCO, under what right did SCO issue
the Ancient UNIX Source Code agreements, whether the restrictive
version of early 1998 or the do-as-you-like Caldera letter of early
2002?  Are those agreements really valid?
