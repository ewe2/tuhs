All,

I have created a TUHS-related github org to store:
1). UUCP-related patched software
2). patched/maintained c-news
3). forks et al of newsreaders

Largely just to give a central locatiom.

Usual disclaimers apply...if you want me to delete the org/change 
name/transfer ownership/etc just shoot me an email.
