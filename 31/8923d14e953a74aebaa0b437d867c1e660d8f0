Yes, I'm trying to work on that. There is a way set some DZ lines
to listen on port Y and the others on port X.

sim> ATTACH DZ X,Line=3,Y,line=4,Z

But there isn't a way to bind to localhost AFAICT. So we should be able to
run uucico only on certain /dev/tty lines, but this still will require
you to iptables block the other port.

Unless someone has a way to bind simh DZ lines to localhost?

Cheers, Warren
