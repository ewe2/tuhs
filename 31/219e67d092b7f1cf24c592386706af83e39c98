It's interesting in more than one way.

The "fail fast" culture seems to result in a lot more failure than I find
acceptable.

As performance is less in coders hands, performance is getting worse.  I
haven't seen less premature optimization, I've just seen more premature
optimization that didn't optimize anything.

My take is that the above changes have resulted in less reliable products
with poor performance being delivered more quickly.  I'm just kind of weird
in that I'd prefer better products delivered more slowly.  Especially since
much of what counts as a product these days is just churn to keep people
buying, not to provide things that are actually useful.
