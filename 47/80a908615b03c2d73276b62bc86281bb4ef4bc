I wasn't even aware that Slackware had rpm... If you send me a typescript of
the build attempt, I can have a look. The version of rpm itself would also
help.

If you mean that the pre-installed system is slow, all I can say is that in
my environment all the BSDs perform well enough for light interactive use,
but running a compiler is not fun. OpenBSD/Vax takes about four hours to
recompile the generic kernel on a dual-1Ghz PIII. BTW, does NetBSD
outperform Quasijarus on real hardware? I suggest, however, to take the
performance analyis offlist and post the results at a later date.

Hello (again) from Gregg C Levine
The RPM file provided didn't build correctly. Remember I did say that
I use Slackware. I don't have a running instance of Red Hat here.
However, I was able to build a copy of SIMH straight from the current
source code.  One thing does get to me, though. This creation moves a
lot slower on SIMH/VAX, then NetBSD, which worked well enough. I'm
guessing that this is indeed a populated pack you have here, but do
you have any idea as to why it's practically moving slower then a
tortoise? This is running on a Pentium 100.

As to your question, yes they are working on it, moving through the
2.4.2x series of kernels. It isn't pretty, but it is working. If you
want to join the list to offer complements, or comments, or just lurk,
go to their website, and tell the list-manager that I sent you. He'll
give you a good seat.
