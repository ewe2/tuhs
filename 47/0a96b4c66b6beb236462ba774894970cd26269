My local computer junk store has a VaxMate for sale.  I'm not sure of the
model -- It has a DB-25 serial port, 10-base-2 ethernet, and a phone-jack
like printer port on the back, as well as an internal ST-225 hard drive
and a 5.25 inch floppy drive.  

Anyway, when I turn it on it tries to boot up -- the graphical slider
thing on the screen gets about 90% of the way across and it displays the
number 83, which I assume is an eeror code since the number changes if you
boot it up with no keyboard.  Anyone know what the 83 means or where I can
get a list of VaxMate error codes?  Also, how intelligent is this machine
compared to a terminal?  Will it actually run a Vax operating system or
does it need a server?

You might not be totally out. I also thought the DEQNA was T-11 based,
since the DEUNA is. :-)

I have a DEQNA in front of me.  There is a micro and that is a 8751 8bitter.
The big chip is a LSI ASIC that is a linked list DMA controller.  No t-11.
The RQDXn(n={1,2,3} uses a t-11.  The DELQA also does not use a T-11.
Both use lots of logic in PALs and ASICs to perform several state machines
needed for eithenet.  At the time of development there were few complete
and fast enough chipsets for eithernet.  The DEQNA is mid 80s design and
quite old.

The DEUNA is quite different.

The DEQNA uses a Intel 8751 (an EPROM version of 8051 family). I suspect that
it may deal with the programming protocol and the ring buffers. The
chip with the F (with bars top and bottom of the letter) is probably
Fujitsu.

These boards had a fairly bad reputation for lockups and dropped packets.
There was a 20+ wire ECO along with a PAL chip (with 8 of the pins cut off)
soldered on top of another chip.

The replacement ethernet controller was the DELQA, which was a complete
redesign and used a 68000 processor.

Never looked carefully at RQDX?, but the DELQA uses an M68K, that much I
*do* know. (As do the DELUA)

You obviously knows more about this than I do. :-)
However, as I said, atleast the DELQA have an M68K...
And the DEQNA is old, yes...

> The DEUNA is quite different.

Obviously. But it is also pretty old. Not as buggy though, which should
have been a clue. :-)

Having two Qbus VAXen and several Qbus PDP-11s it's old turf.  Also I worked 
for DEC Engineering.  that and I've done a lot of hardware level work on my 
systems (repaired dead boards) so the designs are more familair.

DELQA is not 68k, The DEUNA is.  The DELQA is a cost reduced version 
(less buggy too) of the DEQNA and is largely logically the same as the 
DEQNA.

I'm not sure if anyone mentioned this, but you can build a working 2.9
kernel (sans network) from the sources by just commenting out the references
to the networking include files.  I think there is an offending reference in
syslocal.c also.

The DELQA was not 68000. The board was far to small for that and had to be 
Qbus dual width and compatable with DEQNA. I have a few of them in my vaxen 
too.  The Unibus versions DEUNA and the later DELUA were 68k and very good. 
They were partly the reason why 730s and 750s were used for routers long 
after they were replaced for other tasks.

Memory parity exception...  Eat foot time.

DELQA M7516 is 68k and lance chip... had to pull mine to check.  The M7504
however I am correct as I pulled one down from the shelf before dining on 
foot.  Oh and the reson I forgot it's 68k, was the DELQA is far more 
reliable!  that and I only open the BA123 one a year to check the fans and 
clean dust.  It just don't break. ;)

Hate to turn this into a "no it isn't, yet it is" sequence, but all
my DELQA's have prominent 68000's on 'em.

> The board was far to small for that

No, it isn't.  The 68000 is the quad pack, and is smaller than either
of the two custom gate arrays that does the Q-bus handshaking.

What is happening is that `make depend' invokes a script which finds
#includes in the source code, and builds a make dependency. However,
it's not very intelligent, and doesn't ignore:

#ifdef INET
#include <stuff>

when INET isn't defined. :-) This bites on several C files.
You just have to hand-prune the Makefile after make depend :-)
This is 2.9BSD, BTW, ignore if you're not using it.

Really? I have a DELQA sitting right in front of me, and when I look at
it, the large chip definitely says M68000. What could that be then?

Hate to disagree with you, Alison. The the DELQA really is 68000, take a
peek inside yourself. It is a dual-width too...

And the DEUNA is T-11, while the DELUA is 68000.
I have never bothered plugging in any DEUNAs myself, since DELUAs are
pretty common, and they atleast are pretty good. Never had any problems
with any of them.
