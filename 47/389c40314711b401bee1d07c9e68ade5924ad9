Yes, that's an interesting project that has been around for a while.

Unfortunately, I found it to be rather unstable when connecting to the
virtual machine's serial port: after some I/O, the emulated system would
crash and typically leave the virtual disk messed up.

I reported this bug in late 2013 and it was kindly acknowledged, but I
see no version number change on the website, so I don't think it has
been fixed. The developer did warn me at the time that the project
wasn't really being maintained. Too bad, because porting V7 to x86 must
have been no small feat.
