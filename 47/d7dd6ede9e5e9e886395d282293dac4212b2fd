Greetings.

1. I have three or four UNIXpc machines (3b1/7300) including
   one for parts. I can probably hook you up with a replacement
   power supply if needed.

2. I have the technical reference manual for this machine,
   which includes numerous schematics. I would be happy to
   scan in the relevant sections for you.

Feel free to contact me off-list if I can help you with
anything UNIXpc related.
