Subject: [TUHS] Runaway rm -r
Message-ID: <05b301d2bd58$cf338ec0$6d9aac40$@ronnatalie.com>

There was an incident at Pixar that a runaway rm ate most of the Toy Story 2
movie.   The only thing that saved them was an employee had their own copy
on a machine at home.

 

We never lost the whole disk through one of these, but we did have a guy
wipe out /etc/passwd one day.   Our password fields had an rfc-822ish user
name in the gcos field, so it looked

something like:



ron::51:50:Ronald Natalie <ron>:/sys1/ron:

 

Well, one of our users decided to grep for a user (alas while root) with the
command

   grep <howard> /etc/passwd
