Absolutely true - all interactive systems had something like it that I remember. Certainly the 10s but as you point out CDC.  I remember  In the early - mid 1970s CMU had a display outside of the computer center and in the terminal room on a ‘large screen display’ connected to the 360/67 system which ran TSS - IBM’s timesharing system - systat ran constantly. 

As I said before there were lots of versions that were hacks off of ps in the Unix world.  Top as we know it was just a matter of time.
