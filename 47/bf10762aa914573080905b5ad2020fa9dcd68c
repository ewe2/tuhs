The list manager (Warren?) can easily protect this and the PUPS list against
HTML, attachments, and other email badness by using demime. I use it on the
ClassicCmp lists. It basically drops into the aliases file:

    public-alias: "|/usr/local/bin/demime -8 'private-alias'"

Anything goes in, plain text comes out. It's as simple as that.
