Part of me is wondering why anyone cares about Motif.  My memory of that
is that Xview was better and the Athena widgets were better.  Athena was
ugly but it worked, Xview, the X11 version of Sunview, was fantastic to
program in,  the argv was a set of 2 tuples, thing and value.  And it
looked better.  I've written Xview apps and other than the Tk part of
Tcl/Tk, it was the most pleasant GUI API I have used.  For the record,
the Tk part of Tcl/Tk is still, decades later, the best GUI interface
I've ever seen.  John got that right.

So no offense intended, what about Motif is likeable?
