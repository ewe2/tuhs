Subject: Writer's Workbench on Plan 9/9front

Hello TUHS,

I don't know if that mail arrives since I'm not subscribed to the tuhs
mailing list=2E  I just thought this might be interesting to some of
you, especially since I noticed there are some threads about the
writer's workbench=2E

Some weeks ago I started porting V10 wwb tools to 9front (which is a
fork of Plan 9)=2E  I have still many things to do and currently only
limited time, but the greater tools (style, diction and suggest) work=2E

Most code worked fine, btw, only minor changes needed=2E  Especially
implicit C declarations and missing #includes=2E  Comparison with the
original code in the archive is possible=2E

I also tried porting (or rewriting) the shell scripts in rc, and made
mkfiles that better fit the Plan 9 build systems=2E  I also included
acme commands, they also translate the locations into the plumber
format for the files (filename:line)=2E

Here's a link to the git repository (yes, we have a native git
implementation now): https://git=2Esr=2Eht/~sirjofri/wwb9
