Q: What is SVR6?
A: SVR6 is the code name for the next-generation operating platform designed to
take advantage of Web services and is the foundation of our SCOx strategy. As
the owners of the UNIX operating system, it is incumbent upon SCO to advance
the UNIX kernel for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. This will be
accomplished through the support of key industry partners who will also
contribute to this next-generation platform. SVR6 will be formally announced at
our upcoming SCO Forum event to be held in Las Vegas, Nevada on August 17-19 at
the MGM Grand Hotel.

It just keeps getting weirder:
