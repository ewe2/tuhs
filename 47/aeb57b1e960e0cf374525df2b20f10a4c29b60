I think you're referring to an abomination called "xstrings" (or "xstr"?).

It was described by a colleague of mine as "about as subtle as a car 
crash"; it worked by comparing strings at compilation time, even unto the 
tails of said strings.

Woe betide the user if any string was changed at run time...

It ranks right up there with nargs() as What Not To Do.
