Oh, no.  Useful.  There was similar Intel (i think) cpu that was flashable.
I wrote code for it that muxed two lines over one serial line.  I'm sorta
proud of this, this was back in the BLIT days (loved that terminal, holy
crap, loved it).  I was a grad student at Wisconsin and we had one long
serial port line to our office, no ethernet (this was back when 10Mbit
was really weird).  Shared an office with another guy and we had one
blit.  I talked the department out of another one, and did a wire wrapped
board with that CPU on it and all it did was use the 8th bit to mux.
Bit set, his blit, not set, my blit.

Worked fantastic until the blits melted.  Still miss those, they were the
X terminal ahead of their time. 

Anyhoo, the 6502 is a fine little processor and knowing how to make it
sing is a useful skill.

It's not the toy-ness so much, it's what you do with it.  You can do a
lot with that CPU, ask any car company.
