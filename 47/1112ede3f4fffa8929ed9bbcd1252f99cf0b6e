The other difference is that IPv4 was a well-designed protocol, where   
IPv6 is a hodgepodge of harebrained pet projects.  Despite being tagged
version 6, it's the worst case of Second-System Effect I've ever seen in
my life.
        
Most sites I know of that have chosen to sit it out so far have done so
because it's a massive engineering lift with little discernable benefit;
it merely trades IPv4's problems for newer, experimental problems.
        
This is the same situation that keeps UNIX entrenched:  it's not
flawless, but we understand the flaws, and the core design is at least 
comprehensible.
