Hi Bill

you may try a current version of the simh emulator (simh 3.5.-2) which 
is available from simh.trailing-edge.com. I had no problems with Ultrix 
3.1, Unix V6/V7 etc.. I couldn't find xenix for pdpd-11 (did I miss that 
in the archives?). There is Venix, but it's for the PRO-350/380, which 
is not a "normal" PDP-11.

As for the OS Tim Berners-Lee used for his first Browser, I believe that 
it was made on a Norsk Data Technostation. There is very few information 
available on these machines, and I don't think there is an emulator for 
them. There are only a few webpages mentioning it at all: see 
http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~toresbe/nd/history.html for example (it has a 
picture of the machine, note the funny terminal with the two LCD's in 
addition to the monitor). I recently donated my Technostation to a 
computer museum...

regards
