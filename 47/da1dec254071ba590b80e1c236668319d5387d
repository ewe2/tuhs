It may be obvious, but awk(1) uses 1-indexing for arrays and string
offsets, and shell arguments are indexed from 1 too (which may be
reasonable given the special behavior of argv[0], but I think this
resulted in rc(1) being 1-indexed for lists).  pic(1) sensibly uses
1-indexing in the "Nth" notation.


I never thought of it like that wrt awk. However, I always thought of $0 as
"self" in higher level OO languages.
