Subject: [TUHS] unix v5 limitations
Message-ID: <CADxT5N4cYkw_p9n=_v02TexgkB2TKMKf+Dqgbzz_i79kB3tgyg@mail.gmail.com>

Firstly, I should mention I'm using simh to simulate Unix version 5.

Well I tried to reorganize the files in unix v5. Mainly I wanted more
room on rk0 so I figured I'd create a new drive and put all the source
from /usr/source/s1 on it.

The first problem I had was I couldn't just cp over all the
/usr/source/s1 files to the new drive because of "Arg list too long"
so I figured I would just create an archive file called all.a which
would include all the files in /usr/source/s1 and copy that over.

But then I got "phase error" when I tried to keep adding files to the
archive (I had to do this in stages, e.g. ar r all.a /usr/source/s1/a*
then ar u all.a /usr/source/s1/b* etc). Phase error seemed to occur
when the archive got larger than around 160,000 bytes. So I ended up
creating 3 archive files to keep from getting "phase error".

I was wondering does anyone understand what the limits are for the cp
and ar commands?
