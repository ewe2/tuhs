Well, we agree once again.  I have done a lot of work on medical devices,
and was surprised at the lack of diligence on the part of some of the
people with whom I worked.  But your example is similar to the way that
people have trouble with COVID - there's too much of a lag between
exposure and symptoms for many folks to make the connection.  So I'm kind
of wondering what sort of bug may blow up a refinery or chemical plant and
cause enough loss of life and damage to make people take notice.
