The 68000 compiler was pcc and was under fairly continuous development
during this project. So there may be no "missing version" of the compiler
but just version skew between source and existing artifacts.

&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know how complete it is and I think the compiler is al=
so not<br>

&gt; <br>
&gt; From a quick inspection there appears to be a subdirectory =E2=80=9Cm=
=E2=80=9D with motorola tools. It appears to have a M68K pcc-based compiler=
. It also has this README file:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; =3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt; the source for /usr/blit/lib/ccom has been lost.<br>
&gt; the source here (Mip and Mcc) is for a compiler that does not generate=
<br>
&gt; the correct symbol tables for joff and pi.<br>
&gt; we wish we had the source, but we don&#39;t, so the binary is precious=

&gt; =3D=3D=3D<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The =E2=80=9Cbin=E2=80=9D directory has that ccom binary. It suggests =
that there once was a M68K compiler that derived from the Ritchie PDP11 com=
piler. I assume that the source for that has stayed missing ever since 1985=
