Ah, memories.  One of the biggest challenges we faced in porting Unix to
the Interdata 8/32 was starting to do everything in hex.  I can truly say
that I learned it by single-stepping through bootstrap code and reading

As a friend of mine once said to a young programmer "I've written boot
loaders with fewer bytes than you use for variable names!"
