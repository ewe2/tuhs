This is my recollection as well.  In the late 80s with the
introduction of really nice compilers for MS-DOS like Turbo C from
Borland (1987), Watcom C 6.0 (1988) and mature versions of Microsoft C
(which originally was based on Lattice C), the C future was
solidified.

The documentation coming with those compilers were also excellent.  I
still have tons of reference books from that period.  It was a time
when almost everybody was using pure C.  I think C++ needed another
5-7 years to displace C in the application market.
