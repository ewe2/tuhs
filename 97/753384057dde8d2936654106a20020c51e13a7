Ease was posted in comp.sources.<something> and I think there was
;login: article about it. We're talking mid-1980s here. I subsequently
added a few features to it, mainly to support features in Sun's sendmail.

It's mentioned in Eric's (I think) book about Sendmail from the late 80s
or early 90s (and I have a footnote in there, I think).

I will see if I can dig up the sources.  It would undoubtedly take some
work to bring them into the 21st century.
