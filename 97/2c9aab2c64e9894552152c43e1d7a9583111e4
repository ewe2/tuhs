Hi Bakul,

Regarding vi:

You can use tail recursion in the macro because a failed search causes
it to stop.  So `qqq' to start recording to register `q', and then
instantly stop recording, clearing it.  Then the real definition, ending
in an execution of the empty `q'.

    qq/4$^Ma2^[@qq

And finally an `@q' to kick off the recursion.
