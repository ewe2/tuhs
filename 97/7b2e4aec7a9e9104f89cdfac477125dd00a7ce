Great! I'd love to take a look at all that.

That is very interesting. It may be related to the V6 with NCP from UoI/DTI.

Super! In the last couple of months I had retyped the Wingfield TCP from a
printout, some 5,000 lines done and some 700 still to go. Ah well, at least
I have now read the source with attention for each and every line. The
printout does not have the kernel modifications with it, so it would be great
if your archive does include that.

Once you're ready for that, I'd love to get a copy of those 3 versions of Unix.
