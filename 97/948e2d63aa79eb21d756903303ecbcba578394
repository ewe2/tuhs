What a different world it would be if IBM had selected the M68000 and UCSD Pascal.  Both seemed
to me to better better choices at the time.

The license was never worked out as the University of California got overly involved in it. As a result IBM went with their second choice, some small Redmond based company no one had ever heard of. So it was intended and, at least IBM thought, it was good enough for production use.
