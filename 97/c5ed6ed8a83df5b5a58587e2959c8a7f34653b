I'll also follow up on Henry and Noel's e-mail w.r.t the Unix Archive that
TUHS provides. The only files in the public archive are ones where the legal
issues have been resolved. I also keep a hidden archive of files where the
legal issues have not been resolved.

As always, if you would like me to keep an off-site backup of your Unix
bits, the hidden Unix archive is write-only. Save the bits, and also
be mindful of the legal issues.

Cheers, Warren
