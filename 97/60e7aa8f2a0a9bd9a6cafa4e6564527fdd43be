Apollo gave us the long term use of a DN1000.    I ported our image =
processing system to it.     The amusing thing was when you fired up an =
X window manager on the thing, it wrapped all three segments of the =
little status bar at the bottom with window borders.    The DN10000 docs =
came with a beautiful 5 volume set that described all the internals.   =
It was quite detailed for what was there.   What I really needed was the =
documentation on the graphics system which was in Volume 3.   My set was =
missing this.   After much digging around Apollo, it turns out that they =
never wrote volume 3, just assigned the volume number to some yet to be =
written document.

I learned the hard way not to open the gull wing doors on the thing =
while someone was using it.

When HP/Apollo merged and they formally pulled the plug on Domain, I was =
over at the FAA and they showed me the =E2=80=9Clatest=E2=80=9D computer =
they got in that was running a system to show where all the planes in =
the airspace system were (think of FlightAware.COM =
<http://flightaware.com/>, this was a first stab at pulling that data =
from the ATC computers).    It was a DN4000? running domain.   Always =
using the latest stuff at the FAA.
