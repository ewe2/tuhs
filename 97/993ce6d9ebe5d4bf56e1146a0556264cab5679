Subject: [pups] bsd2.11 kernel compile
Message-ID: <3D0E81C0.9046BF5D@bellsouth.net>

I am building a PDP 11 from junked parts and have it 
mostly working. I'm now installing BSD 2.11 and have run into 
a problem i could use some help with.

When compiling a new kernel (to include network) I get an error

ld: too big for type 431
*** exit 2

I assume this error is due to one of the overlays being too 
large. (this is pointed out in the install docs)

How do I figure out which overlay (or base) is the problem?
The random module shuffle in the documents only has 10 million 
combinations and at 30 minutes to compile, well I'm not going
to live that long. 

Is there a more scientific way to arrange the overlays?
Am I missing something obvious?
