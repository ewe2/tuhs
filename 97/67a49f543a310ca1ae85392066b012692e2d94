Lots of stuff is not evil.  BitKeeper, my baby, is pretty sweet.  But you
know what?  Everyone uses Git or SVN.  Being not evil isn't enough.

I like make.  I carried around the source to a Sys III make (I think) because
it had enough in it that it was useful and didn't have all the crud that
is in GNU make.

I do wish that some simple make had stuffed a scripting language in there.
Anything, tcl, lua, even (horrors, can't believe I'm saying this) a little
lisp.  Or ideally a built in shell compat language.  All those backslashes
to make shell scripts work get old.
