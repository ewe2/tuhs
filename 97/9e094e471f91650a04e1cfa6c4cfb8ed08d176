Whilst spelunking in the V8 source code I came across this dozen lines:
=
http://chiselapp.com/user/pnr/repository/v8unix/artifact/2782d26fa2930724?=
ln=3D174,187

It implements the /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr devices (the =
variable =E2=80=98file_no=E2=80=99 in above code snippet is the constant =
40, which is the major number of these devices). It would seem that this =
handful of lines could have been in Unix as early as 4th Edition =E2=80=94=
 but they weren=E2=80=99t. Maybe it was not seen as useful.

As far as I can tell this bit of code originates in 8th Edition, with no =
earlier precursors. It does not seem to be in its man pages.

Who added this neat little innovation?
