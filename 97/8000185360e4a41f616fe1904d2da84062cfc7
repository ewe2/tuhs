Well, except that there were no non-printing characters in Fieldata.

Yes, I heard of them, but they didn't seem to be a commercial success.
I worked with UNIVAC kit from 1973 to 1977, on the 1108/1106 and the
494, but I never saw any card like that.  They also had a very nice
card punch, the VIP, that buffered a card content and only punched
when you released the card, thus enabling erasures.  But it used
standard IBM format cards.
