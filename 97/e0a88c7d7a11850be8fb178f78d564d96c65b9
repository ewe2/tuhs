I have Debian installed in the Linux emulation environment on my main 
computer (as well as on my other desktop), so I decided to try running the 
finger command from your .sig ;p

Works fine on my end.  (It's supposed to end in "20Segmentation fault 
(core dumped)", right?)

I have never tried to install a finger daemon on any of my boxen so as to 
permit being able to receive incoming finger requests.  Just hasn't been 
important enough to me.

-uso.
