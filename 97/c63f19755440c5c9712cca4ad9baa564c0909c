Subject: [TUHS] There is turmoil in Linux-land - When did rm first avoid
	going upwards?
Message-ID: <20170424214212.GA4966@naleco.com>

Hello all.

It's off-topic for this list, but there is turmoil in Linux-land. A bug
was discovered in systemd, whereby systemd re-implemented "rm"
functionality without following POSIX "rm" behaviour. This could kill a
system, as explained here: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/5644

The reference POSIX "rm" behaviour is that "rm -rf .*" should NOT delete
the current and parent directories, as stated here:
http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/rm.html#tag_20_111_16

So, to get on-topic, I have a question for UNIX historians: when was it
first defined in the UNIX realm that "rm -r .*" should NOT delete the
current and parent directories? Would the command "cd /tmp ; rm -rf .*"
be able to kill a V6 or V7 UNIX system?

Regards,
