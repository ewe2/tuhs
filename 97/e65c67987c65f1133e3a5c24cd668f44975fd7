I remember that Victor Frankenstein ;) Proved how close these 2 were.

Very glad that piece of history got unearthed.

386BSD is now bootable in Bochs, with very, very specific settings.
One that works at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dugoh/tobochs/master/bochsrc

Back then it required a patch against bochs too as the boot blocks
do some truly weird stuff with the PIC (polling OCW3?), something
most emulators don't implement or even barf on.

These 2 little marvels didn't have much bloat, but the Bostification
had already set in. My idea of a true diet x86 UNIX system would be
a report of Tahoe without resorting to gcc/gas or anything else that
smells like RMS.
