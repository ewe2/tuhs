Yes, there's always SOME way to avoid it, but obviously significantly 
more work. Just depends what the priorities are... Preserving fanfold 
seems like a strange priority, wouldn't it be more practical bound

Or, similar to your suggestion, load it into a compatible printer (so 
that it can be sprocket fed), with some kind of takeup spool, then form 
feed pages through, snapping each one between feeds.
