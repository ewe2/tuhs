Strangely enough, the definition I have of a runtime system is very 
different than yours. Languages had/have runtime systems. Some 
environments had runtime systems, but they have a somewhat different 
scope than what MS-DOS is.
I'd call MS-DOS a program loader and a file system.

Uh? RSX and RSTS/E are full fledged operating systems with multiuser 
proteciton, time sharing, virtual memory, and all bells and whistles you 
could ever ask for... Including networking... DECnet was born on RSX.

And RSTS/E offered several runtime systems, it had an RT-11 runtime 
system, an RSX runtime system, you also had a TECO runtime system, and 
the BASIC+ runtime system, and you could have others. You could 
definitely have had a Unix runtime system in RSTS/E as well, but I don't 
know if anyone ever wrote one.

In RSX, compilers/languages have runtime systems, which you linked with 
your object files for that language, in order to get a complete runnable 
binary.
