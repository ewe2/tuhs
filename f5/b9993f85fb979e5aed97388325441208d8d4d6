Heh.  When I was in undergrad we were all on an 11/780 with 1MB of ram
and about 30-40 terminals talking to it.  

As strange as it may sound, to this day I miss that.  Terminal rooms
were the ultimate communication zone.  Looking over someone's shoulder
and saying "how did you do that?" when they did !}fmt

Those were the days...  Where is Henry Spencer when you need him?
