OED suggests that both our "bug" and "bugbear" are derived from "bug"
(An insect or other arthropod).  It agrees with the 1552 date:

1552 R. King Funerall Serm. sig. F.iiiiv Momishe mopers whiche can do
     none other thyng else, but mope vppon ther bookes, to make vs
     afraied of shadowes and buggeberes.
