That may have been the origin, but Hazeltine persisted even in later versions of the terminal which implemented later ASCII and had a printing ~ at 126.    That's why the comment and associated code is in the terminal driver.  In order to print a ~ you had to send it twice.

Not the terminal's fault.  It was just implementing ASCII-63, in which ESC was up by DEL, in the current position of ~.  Other terminals did ASCII-67, the current standard.
