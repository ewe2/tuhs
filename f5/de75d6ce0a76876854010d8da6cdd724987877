The mailman version i use supports REMOVE_DKIM_HEADERS out of the
box?  (This is v2.1.24, i hope that and Python2 will be maintained
for a while time.)  So i have REMOVE_DKIM_HEADERS=2 which always
removes those headers, but more possibilities exist.  There is
also special support for DMARC, but i never fiddled with that.
(I personally use SPF -all and hope for the day DNS via DTLS or
TLS finally becomes reality.  I never understood DNSSEC as such.)
