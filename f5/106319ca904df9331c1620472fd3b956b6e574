We do the same thing here.  For /home which has all the stuff we really
care about we have 

	/nightly	- last night's copy of the data
	/nightly2	- same thing, night before
	/weekly		- last Sunday's copy of the data
	/weekly2	- same thing, week before

and we do it so that

	diff foo /nightly/$PWD

works.  Handy, that.
