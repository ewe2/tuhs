I remembered reading about Knuth's line-breaking  algorithm in
Software Practice & Experience in early eighties and being quite
impressed with it. So may be that clear description of the algorithm
has something to do with it? Ah, here it is:

“Breaking Paragraphs into lines” by Donald Knuth & Plass,
SP&E, Volume 11, issue 11, Nov. 1981
