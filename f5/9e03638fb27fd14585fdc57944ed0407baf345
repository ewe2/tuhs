Hi Folks,

I thought everybody already knew about the v5 manual, I've known about
it for quite some time now.

The pdf file I have (which I assume is the same as the one mentioned
here) is already OCRed. I've been working on recreating the man pages
for v5 by matching the date codes from v6. If the dates match and the
contents of the files match I just copy over the v6 version into v5.
Sometimes I even use the v4 version if it differs from v6 but matches
the v5 manual. In the worst case scenario there's enough information
to retype a man page from scratch. I also used the v6 man page script
in v5 and that does the job.

There's not much room in the rk05 image so I created two more rk05
images and split up everything so there's some room for everything. I
was going to submit all 3 disk images once I was happy with all the
modifications. I've made a bunch of improvements to the baseline
version contained in uv5swre.zip .

There's a few things missing from v5:

The source code for yacc, sno, chess and crpost is missing. Also the
chess opening book is missing.
Also missing is mboot.s and alloc.s

I consider my work on v5 to be incomplete but there's a lot of
interesting stuff added so far. Some of the missing stuff can be
filled in from v6, it compiles OK. I can send a tarball to archive.org
or tuhs if you folks want to see the work done so far.

Mark
