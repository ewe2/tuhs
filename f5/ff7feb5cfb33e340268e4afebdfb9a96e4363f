No, alas; and I tried 'finger Schienbrood at lcs.mit.edu' and got no result.
Maybe he was in some other part of MIT, not Tech Sq?

That happened at MIT, too - we had SCCS quite early (my MIT V6 manual has
it), plus all sorts of other stuff (e.g. TROFF).

I think some of it may have come through Jon Sieber, who, while he was in high
school, had been part of (IIRC) a Scout troop which had some association with
Bell Labs, and continued to have contacts there after he became an MIT
undergrad.
