Is it a nice feature to have?  Yes.
Will it save people (like yourself) time?  Likely.

Is it worth hype (that I'm seeing)?  I don't think so.

Read:  My opinion is that Notepad's new feature is not worth the hype 
that I am seeing.

I feel like Notepad's new feature is going to impact fewer people than 
something like the Windows XP firewall being enabled by default did.
