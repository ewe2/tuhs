I'm back from a trip to Cania Gorge in Queensland Australia where there is
next to no phone reception.

When I scanned in the old AUUG newsletters, I told the photocopier to also
do OCR. This means that I can do this to the scanned files:

for i in *.pdf
do j=`echo $i | sed 's/pdf/txt/'`
   echo $j
   pdftotext $i
   grep ENO $j
   rm $j
done

Yet another reason why Unix is so much better :-) Here are the results
which will help Arnold out with his question.

Cheers, Warren
