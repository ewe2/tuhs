Subject: [TUHS] Citation for Spencer quote?
Message-ID: <20110728014241.GA577@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, thanks for the help with that image of Ken and Dennis at the 11/20
console. Now I'm after a reference/citation to a great quote attributed to
Henry Spencer:

    Those who don't understand Unix are condemned to reinvent it, poorly.

Any ideas if/when Henry said this and where: date, first time it appeared
in print etc.

While we are at it, are there any other good Unix quotes that spring to mind?

Thanks,
	Warren
