I have something similar.  It allocates space for two ints (number
allocated and used) at ((int *)array)[-1] and [-2].

Typical use is

    LTVectorAndInit(char *, names);

    while(...)
      LTVectorPush(names, s);

    for(i=0; i<LTVectorCount(names); i++)
      ... names[i] ...;

    LTVectorFree(names);
