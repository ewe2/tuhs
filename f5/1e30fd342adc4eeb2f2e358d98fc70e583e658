That sounds mostly right, from memory. V8 was definitely adapted from
some 4BSD, not 32V - there was major internal friction on that
decision. I will admit to being a defender of Reiser and London's VAX
port, which was screamingly fast. However.

Regarding select, I recall that Dennis implemented it and passed it to
Berkeley*, but maybe not. He certainly had a hand in its design; I
distinctly remember talking to him about it after one of his trips out
west.

A note for the historians: Bell Labs's Unix Support Group (USG), which
did development work for Unix, and was not even in the same building
as Research, was run by Berkley (sic) Tague. Thus we had Berkeley Unix
and Berkley's Unix and no end of fun and confusion on that score.

in terms of raw comparison, I suspect the basis is 4BSD rather than 4.1cBSD=
.  I don't know that we have a clean copy of 4.1BSD gold, I'd be interested=
 to see if the structure of the source code changed between 4.1 and 4.1c, a=

that V8 adds a lot of innovation on top of that (streams, file system switc=

e Blit terminal, etc.). Networking in the V8 kernel (including Chaos) is or=
ganised very differently from 4.1cBSD.
