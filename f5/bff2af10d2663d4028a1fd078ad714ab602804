I'll leave it to others to describe the early days.  The Berkeley
Software License Agreement, generally called the BSD license, is
pretty straightforward, though.  Take a look at
http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/license.html for the original
copyright, under which 4.4BSD was released, and at
http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/freebsd-license.html for the current
BSD license.
