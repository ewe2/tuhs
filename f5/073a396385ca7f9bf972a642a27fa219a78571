Message-ID: <7wr2omc2j5.fsf@junk.nocrew.org>

Hello,

Is this "Network Unix" available?

https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/32817/networkunixsyste243kell.pdf

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc681

Or, is there another Unix which will do pre-TCP/IP Arpanet?  I have an
off-topic system with NCP, but no one to talk to.
