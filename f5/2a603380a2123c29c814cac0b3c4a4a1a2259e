Seriously, it could be used in test scripts, to see whether a test depends
implicitly upon a previous one, so if something fails it would be worthy 
of investigation.

     Usage: maybe [p]

     Returns "true" (0) with a probability of "p" [0.0:1.0] (default: 0.5),
     else "false" (1).

C:	exit(**argv != 't');	// Assumes "t*" or not.
