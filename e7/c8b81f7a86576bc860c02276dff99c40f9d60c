Brian,

The easiest thing is set up a BSD box of any flavor (I have a FreeBSD box
that used to have modems on it).   Then grab a USB to RS-232C cable if it
does not have a serial ports on it already.   Make sure there is a
getty/login configured for the port and your are set.   At that point you
can directly attach the terminal to the cable.    No need for the modem.

You will get the user effect, accept for the sounds of the modem connecting
and dealing with dialing itself.  If you wanted those, you could of course
put the terminal on a modem and connect the BSD system to a modem. Then
either use to two POTS lines if you want to spend money from the TPC.
Actually thinking about, you could also set up a POTS line emulator (which
if you google you can make one pretty easily).

Funny, just this AM, I put into the the electronics recycling box at work 4
telebit "Worldblazer" modems and a POTS line emulator (and a bunch of other
old junk).   I've been clean out my basement and I knew I would never use
those again.

Clem
