Subject: [TUHS] UNIX V6 line 3973: Is it really a typo?
Message-ID: <2051ec920610162326v26712aedw8d38b6fe49b6d20b@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,

It's stated in Lion's book chapter 13.13 that at line 3973, i.e. the
function psignal, there is a typo where the p_stat should be p_pri.

Is there anyone can confirm it?

If it's really a bug, why it remains p_stat in UNIX V7?

Thanks in advance

Qinglai
