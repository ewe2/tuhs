Maybe there's a generation / technology gap here. But from history, it
doesn't seem like there was much free - though most did indeed to be open -
I suppose much like the VMS model. At least not until the 80s (or maybe
bash predates that trend).

The C language might've been free, but I wonder if there were any free
compilers until gcc (hell I remember pirating Borland). Even most copies of
*BSD were mainly sold on CD vs downloaded until 10 years or so ago (even
though it was technically free - not including BSDi)

I'm not sure what hippie attributes you had in mind, but one
candidate would be "free and open". In software, though, free
and open was the style of the late 50s. By the hippie heyday
