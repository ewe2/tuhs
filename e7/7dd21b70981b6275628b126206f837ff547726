The key is I think *competition*.  Distributions were competing to
attract a user base, and one of the ways they could do that was by
improving the install experience.  There were people who reviewed
distributions based on which one had the better installer, and that
helped users who were Windows refugees choose the ones that had the
better installer.

The other advantages of having a many distributions is that gave more
people to opportunity to exercise leadership --- you can "drive the
big red firetruck" by founding a distro like Debian or Slackware, and
the people who are interested in improving a distribution can be
different from those who drive kernel development.  This is one of the
things that I've learned from my rector at my church, who had a
background in community organizing.  One of the big differences
between community organizing compared to the corporate world is that
it's more important to give more people --- volunteers ---
opportunities to contribute, and very often this is far more important
than efficiently organizing a corporate-style team to get some job
done.  Was it inefficient to have multiple teams competing on
installer development, and release engineering?  Sure, but it also
drew more people into the Linux ecosystem.

There are three different things that's worth separating.  One is a
consistent kernel<->user space interface, this is what Linus Torvalds
considers high priority when he says, "Thou shalt not break
userspace".  This is what allows pretty much all distributions to
replace the kernel that was shipped with the distribution with the
latest upstream kernel.  And this is something that in general doesn't
work with *BSD systems.

The second is application source-level compatibility, and this is what
allows you to download some open source application, and recompile it
on different Linux distributions, and it should Just Work.  In
practice this works for most Linux and *BSD users.

And the third is application *binary* level compatibility.  And this
is what is important if you have some binary that you've downloaded,
or some commerical application which you've purchased, and you want to
run it on Linux distribution different from the one which is
originally designed.  Static linking solves most of the problems, but
if the user needs to use proprietary/commercial binaries, if they
stick to RHEL, Fedora, Ubuntu/Debian, they will generally not have
issues.
