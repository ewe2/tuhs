Oh, I've worked with them before.

I just go out of my way to edgumicate them.  I'll learn them gud.

(Maybe the 3' pipe wrench has something to do with it.)

Suffice it to say that I will bend over backwards to teach people how to

I'll believe that in five years.  After the version of Notepad that 
supports unix new lines is on current and (then) older systems.  Until 
then, you'll probably still be pandering to them.

I did say that I'm a curmudgeon, didn't I?
