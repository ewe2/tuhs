That makes me wonder... where does pg(1) fit into this history? There's
a version of it in the 32V tree in the TUHS archive, but nowhere else,
yet it surfaces in modern Unixes such as Solaris and there's a clone in
the "util-linux" package. It also shows up in SuSv2 (marked LEGACY, and
absent from later versions). Was it part of System III/V?
