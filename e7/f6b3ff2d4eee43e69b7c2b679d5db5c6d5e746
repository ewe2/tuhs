Subject: [TUHS] SCO File List - Sort Of
Message-ID: <200311121719.06715.rweather@zip.com.au>

Groklaw has one of SCO's legal filings in the SCO/IBM case up that contains a 
list of files that they claim contain infringing material:

    http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031111020447263

It seems to be basically "grep -r (SMP|IBM|NUMA|JFS) /usr/src/linux" with 
little filtering of the output.  The list contains filenames but not the 
actual line numbers of the supposedly infringing code.  So it is pretty 
useless, but is more of a starting point than we've had to date.

I've got dibs on 48 hours in the "how long it takes for the community to find 
prior public domain sources for all of the above" pool. :-)

Cheers,

Rhys.
