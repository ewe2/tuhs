When was the "mv" command first updated to do a copy/remove for regular
files being moved across filesystems?

V2 mv(1) manual says files can't be moved across filesystems. V3 mv(1)
manual doesn't say either way. V4 mv(1) manual says the file will be
copied and the original deleted. V5 mv(1) source code exec's cp(1) when
the destination is on a different filesystem.

So wait.  I need some clarification here.  When you say V2, V3, V4, etc..
do you mean 2nd Ed, 3rd Ed, 4th Ed Unix?
