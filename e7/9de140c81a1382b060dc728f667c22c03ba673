TL; DR.  I'm trying to find the best possible home for some dead trees.

I have about a foot-high stack of manilla folders containing "early Unix =
papers".  They have been boxed up for a few decades, but appear to be in =
perfect condition.  I inherited this collection from Jim Joyce, who =
taught the first Unix course at UC Berkeley and went on to run a series =
of ventures in Unix-related bookselling, instruction, publishing, etc.

The collection has been boxed up for a few decades, but appears to be in =
perfect condition.  I don't think it has much financial value, but I =
suspect that some of the papers may have historical significance.  =
Indeed, some of them may not be available in any other form, so they =
definitely should be scanned in and republished.

I also have a variety of newer materials, including full sets of BSD =
manuals, SunExpert and Unix Review issues, along with a lot of books and =
course handouts and maybe a SUGtape or two.  I'd like to donate these =
materials to an institution that will take care of them, make them =
available to interested parties, etc.  Here are some suggested =
recipients:

- The Computer History Museum (Mountain View, CA, USA)
- The Internet Archive (San Francisco, CA, USA)
- The Living Computers Museum (Seattle, WA, USA)
- The UC Berkeley Library (Berkeley, CA, USA)
- The Unix Heritage Association (Australia?)=20
- The USENIX Association (Berkeley, CA, USA)

According to Warren Toomey, TUHS probably isn't the best possibility.  =
The Good News about most of the others is that I can get materials to =
them in the back of my car.  However, I may be overlooking some better =
possibility, so I am following Warren's suggestion and asking here.  I'm =
open to any suggestions that have a convincing rationale.

Now, open for suggestions (ducks)...
