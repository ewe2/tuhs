Well, that's true.  I've read every other technical book of his apart
from the ‘AMPL: A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming’.
https://amzn.to/3BdQ0dV

It was the quality of his writing which meant I could learn C and Unix
at home well enough to get a C programming job on Sun OS on leaving
school, which is sixteen over here.  Within a year or so, work sent me
to Sydney as part of shipping the flight simulator to Qantas.  Good
books have immeasurable worth across all their readers.

Thanks, it's ordered, arriving Valentine's Day, which will impress
SWMBO.  :-)
