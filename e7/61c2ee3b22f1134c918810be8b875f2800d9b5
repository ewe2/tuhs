As much as I want to agree with you, I think that the stand alone 
islands still would have gotten more popular than Usenet at least for 
the following reason:

1)  Web sites can control what the site looks like, thus the GUI people 
can fiddle to their hearts content.
2)  It's much simpler to build some random database to hold comments for 
a web forum than it is to comply with / inter operate with / adhere to 
(arguably simple) standards.

I don't know how many people can be brought back to Usenet.  Further, I 
don't know how many people I want brought back to Usenet.

IMHO Usenet works for those that want it to work.  It provides the 
desired service and is IMHO just obscure enough that the mainstream is 
not on it.  I'm cool with that.

I think there are a number of people / hobbyists that run (text only) 
news servers (like myself) doing exactly that.

I think there are some efforts at reducing spam and making moderation 
work.  I don't know any details about them.

I think that we need to hold server operators accountable for people 
that post crap through them.  I routinely see lots of crap posted to 
specific Linux newsgroups, and almost all of it passes through a 
specific server (network).  Just about the time that I get motivated to 
contact the abuse contact, the crap stops.
