First, you'd need to remove it as the *interrupt* character, which I
don't think the stty command in V7 can do, though the kernel supports it
with TIOCSETC. Signal characters are processed before input control
ones.

#include <sgtty.h>
struct sgttyb buf;
main() {
ioctl(1, TIOCSETC, "\3\34\21\23\4\377");
gtty(1, &buf);
buf.sg_erase = 0177;
buf.sg_kill = 025;
stty(1, &buf);
}

Also, it won't actually erase the character (unless your terminal
interprets an echoed ^? that way - to my knowledge only putty does) -
the crterase flag [and feature], which echoes space-backspace-space on
erase was added later than V7.

IIRC, it doesn't have effect on the first character of the line, which
is enough for C. Looking through the TTY driver, it looks like there's
code for backslash to escape it.

You could probably put something together with stty raw, od, and sed q
(head didn't exist in v7, and you need *something* to cut things off
because ctrl-d won't work with stty raw), but it may be easier to figure
out what all your keys produce outside of your classic unix environment.
