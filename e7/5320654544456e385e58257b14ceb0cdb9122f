Hmm. I think you are trying to put to fine a point on it.  Having had this c=
onversation with a number of folks who were there, you=E2=80=99re right that=
 the ability to memory on the Unibus at the lower end was clearly there but I=
=E2=80=99ll take Dave Cane and Henk=E2=80=99s word for it as calling it an I=
O bus who were the primary HW folks behind a lot of it.  Btw it=E2=80=99s re=
placement, Dave=E2=80=99s BI, was clearly designed with IO as the primary po=
int. It was supposed to be open sourced in today=E2=80=99s parlance but DEC c=
losed it at the end.  The whole reason was to have an io bus the 3rd parties=
 could build io boards around.  Plus,  By then DEC started doing split trans=
actions on the memory bus ala the SMI which was supposed to be private. Afte=
r the BI mess,   And then By the time of Alpha BI morphed into PCI which was=
 made open and of course is now Intel=E2=80=99s PCIe.   But that said, even t=
oday we need to make large memory windows available thru it for things like m=
essaging and GPUs - so the differences can get really squishy.   OPA2 has a f=
ull MMU and can do a lot of cache protocols just because the message HW real=
ly looks to memory a whole lot like a CPU core.  And I expect future GPUs to=
 work the same way.=20

And at this point (on die) the differences between a memory and io bus are o=
ften driven by power and die size.  The Memory bus folks are often willing t=
o pay more to keep the memory heiarchary a bit more sane.  IO busses will of=
ten let the SW deal with consistency in return for massive scale. =20

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.=
