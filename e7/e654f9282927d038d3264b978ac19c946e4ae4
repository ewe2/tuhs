Anything that had Sun's NFS had YP, at least as of version 2.0. It was 
part of the package.

Somewhere in Warren's archive is a source copy of NFS 2.0 from Sun that 
I donated. It's replete with all the YP stuff. Not sure if the following 
is the copy I donated, but it's close enough:

https://minnie.tuhs.org//cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=NFSv2/usr/src/usr.bin/ypcat.c

 From my copy:

-r--r--r--   1 krewat   kilonet     6356 Nov 20  1985 
./usr/src/usr.bin/ypcat.c

Interesting that the date is one day off.

The copy of NFS 2.0 that I donated was integrated with BSD 4.2 at 
Computer Graphics Lab at New York Institute of Technology. When they 
went kaput, I managed to get my hands on that NFS tape along with a slew 
of other stuff that I can't do anything with because it's all copywrited.

/etc/nsswitch.conf in Solaris originated with NIS+ (NISPLUS). Sun seems 
to be the origin, and it only came about because of NIS+. That's my 
theory and I'm sticking with it ;)
