Ah.  Maybe I understand where you are coming (or may be not).  What the form=
al marketing  names were on the street - I never much worried about.  I=E2=80=
=99ve always followed the engineering path between the teams on the inside a=
nd the technologies and never cared what the marketing people named them.=20=


What we now call pci was developed as the io bus for turbo laser as part of =
 Alpha.  It needed to be cheap, fast and expandable to 64 bits.  Intel and t=
he PC did not have anything coming that could do that and the DEC folks knew=
 that. =20

Anyway.  You may also remember intel tripped over 10 patents in the mid 90s w=
hen Penguin magically caught up in one generation and DEC sued Intel - my fa=
vorite Andy Grove quote - =E2=80=9Cthere is nothing left to steal.=E2=80=9D =
 One of the patents was part of the pci bus technology.  You are probably co=
rrect that it was sourced at dec as part of the turbochannel program - I don=
=E2=80=99t remember.   But the result of the suit was that the guts of pci w=
as licensed by intel from DEC.  I played a very very small part of it all th=
at a long time ago.  The NDAs have probably all expired but I generally don=E2=
=80=99t talk much more about it that what I have.  =20

When it was all said and done AMD got the Alpha memory bus (K7 and EV6 are e=
lectrical brothers) and the industry got PCI.   =20


BTW.  When I came to Intel I do know there was still grumbling about license=
 fees to then HP.   I=E2=80=99m not sure how all that was finally resolved b=
ut I believe it has been as part of the Itainium stuff but I=E2=80=99ve not b=
een a part of any of that. =20

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.=
