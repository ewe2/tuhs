Because I'm old and tired and not really interested in playing that

And because if BSD wants to succeed it's doing it wrong.  I'm not Mr
Big Shot but I do have a track record of being somewhat clueful.  If
I'm not good enough for BSD how will unknown people fare?

But I think we're pretty far into the weeds, don't want to give
Warren more gray hairs so perhaps this is better if it is taken
off list.
