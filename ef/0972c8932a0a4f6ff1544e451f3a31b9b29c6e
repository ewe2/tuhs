It is unlikely anything will happen before the Novel/SCO case is
completely over.  All that has happened is that a key verdict on one
aspect of the case has been rendered.  In all likelihood, Novel will
likely end up on top, but until the litigation is actually over, they
are unlikely to do anything.
