I think it was slightly later. I joined mid-1980 and VAXes to replace the
11/70 were being discussed but had not arrived. We needed to convert a lab
into a VAX machine room and decide between BSD and Reiser, all of which
happened in the second half of 1980.

Reiser Unix got demand paging a little later, and it was spectacularly
fast. I remember being gobsmacked when I saw a demo in early 1981.

Dead ends everywhere.
