Freakin autocorrect.   I built ksh for SVR2 to have it on the MIS dept.  Xelos 3230s.  

CCUR never made it to SVR4 on the 3200 series decendants of the 7/32 and 8/32 machines.

I believe that was indeed the first UNIX release to have it included.

Wasn't ksh SVR4... It was in the Xelos sources @Concurrent Computer which was an SVR2 port.  Xelos didn't do paging but the source in 87 or 88 or so had ksh in it. 

I. built it for SVR4 on my Xelos 3230 back in the day.
