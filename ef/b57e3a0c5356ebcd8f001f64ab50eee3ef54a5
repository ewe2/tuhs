SunOS's compiler that shipped with it wasn't that usable. It didn't fully support
the C standards at the time. 

It was used primarily for two things.

*) To compile the few kernel objects that were shipped as source & to 
link in all the binary objects into one new kernel for patching/tuning. 

*) To bootstrap GCC so one had a usable compiler to build packages. GCC
had special code used for the bootstrap process specificly at the time
on SunOS, written in a level that the SunOS compiler could deal with. 

Otherwise, it could only be used for simple projects. 

As others stated, the output of the compiler would have been a.out, and
not ELF like Solaris 2.x would have needed.

Some people equate SunOS from a time when all Unices still had (usable) compilers,
but that was actually an earlier time frame. Sun was selling its
standards compliant compilers for SunOS before Solaris 2.x was around.
