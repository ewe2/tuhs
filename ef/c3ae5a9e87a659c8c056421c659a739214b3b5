 From my experience, you need to have a recent release of SIMH in order to
run 4.3BSD.  A few months ago, I managed to build "working" Quasijarus and
Reno disk images (Quasijarus appears to work fine for me, but Reno is as
buggy as I remember it being on real hardware).  I had to use Ultrix and
Netbsd to do the bootstrap/install; I could not get the tape boot to work
at all.
