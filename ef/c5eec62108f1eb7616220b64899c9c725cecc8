With apologies for the outburst:

When I first subscribed to tuhs several years ago (even though I don't
really belong in here; I'm younger than even Linux, much less any of
the Unixen), I *very much* enjoyed reading the various stories about
UUCP, about Sun, about X11, VMS, ARPAnet =E2=80=93 often first-hand tales, =
no
less.

So I don't know what counts as 'signal' on this list versus 'noise',
but I'd much rather read a million posts about OSI, CLNP and other
networks =E2=80=93 a history lesson and information that's been getting sca=
rce
in general =E2=80=93 than kill/mute yet another thread full of generic "boo=
 M$
Windoze" drivel that I can already find on Reddit.

Thanks,
