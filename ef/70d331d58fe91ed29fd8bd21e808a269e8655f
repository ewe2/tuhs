I'd run plan9 (or *BSD or even SmartOS) if I could grab an install image
and change host/IP, add some users, aliases, and it just worked.

In fact, I'd pay for that.  If it actually worked I'd pay $500 for the
install image and $100/year for updates to the spam filter.

Corey, what do you charge for your email service?  All I need is inbound
spam filtering, I've got a working linux box that can receive and send
mail but my MX is rackspace.
