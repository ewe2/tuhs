I have a question about something in this link:

	http://minnie.tuhs.org/Seminars/Saving_Unix/

Where it says:

	Two other PUPS members, Norman Wilson and Robert D. Keys, have
	been OCR'ing the manuals from 1st Edition up to 5th Edition,
	so that they can be given to Dennis and added to the PUPS Archive.

That was back in 1999.  Did this ever happen?  If not, any chance of
getting it to happen?

Thanks!

Arnold
