Trying a one solution fits all approach was always Microsoft's approach.
Back over a decade ago when I was big into MFC development, it was amazing
how much of the Windows bloat was present in WINCE (or Windows Moble as they
later styled it).    It's almost impossible to differentiate a desktop and
mobile on the Windows side.   They tout it as an advantage.

Oddly, Android gives an indication of how to do it right.   Sure, you can
take the essentials out of the common system, but you don't have to move
inappropriate bloat over.
