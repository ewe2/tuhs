I had a 3B1, very different machine, 68K based, I liked it.  The 3B2 was,
well, if I'm being nice, an also ran.  It was a thing but it was never
the thing.  I've run at least one of the lower end models, it worked 
but it was behind the other systems I ran.  Cool that they did it, 
but like many attempts, not enough ahead.

I have very fond memories of the BLIT terminals, I just liked how much
you got out of a serial cable.  Way, way more than anyone else imagined.
