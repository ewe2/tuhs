I first heard this form used in the movie "Aladdin" (the 1992 Disney one, 
with Robin Williams).

It may not be as much of a protection, but I replaced the system rm on my 
Debian with one based on 4.4BSD (since I already had the code lying 
around) to which I added a bit of protection against attempts to "rm -rf 
/" after a worm got in and ran an obfuscated version of that...thankfully 
it didn't run as the superuser.

I do get occasional "invalid switch" errors from it while using apt, so it 
probably uses a gnuism (since afaict, the code I used was strictly 
conformant to Posix). Otherwise, it hasn't caused any issues.

-uso.
