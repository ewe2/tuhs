No idea. I occasionally scan cctalk, but most of the time don't bother. 
Too much noise and irrelevant or ignorant posts. However, unfortunately 
I don't have any better suggestions where to go if you are trying to 
restore old hardware and don't have enough knowledge.

And yes, I keep lots of different PDP-8, PDP-11 and VAXen running, 
including 11/70 systems.
