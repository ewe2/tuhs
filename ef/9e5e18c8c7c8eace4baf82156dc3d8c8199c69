Many thanks!  I love this bit:

     At Xerox, the weekly group meetings were called Dealer, as in Dealer’s
     choice.  The speaker set the rules.  The culture was for the audience
     to do their level best to challenge the ideas.  Bob talked about
     civility, and about the necessity of “turning type one disagreements
     into type two disagreements”.  A type two disagreement is where each
     party understands and can explain the position of the other.

We can all learn something from that...
