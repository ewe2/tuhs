+1 Will.

And just as an aside, Deborah used to be president of Usenix.  She's part
of the history that this list is all about, I've appealed to her as well
to stick around.

Deborah, for the record, if it helps at all, Warren (who runs the
list), has booted at least one person who was not so cool (I'm biased
because I got into with that person, just so you know).  If people are
repeatedly out of line, it's very rare that happens, but if they are it
will get taken care of.  This is a friendly place, rudeness is not part
of the list.

I want to keep as many people around as possible, I love Unix, love
the history of it all, more history, more better.  Please consider
giving the list a second chance.
