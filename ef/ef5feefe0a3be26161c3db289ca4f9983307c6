> I've stumbled across LSX, and I have it running on SimH. I'm quite =
inexperienced with Unix, but it's something I want to learn well, having =
brushed against it at university in the '80s, and having played with =
Linux somewhat.

I think you will experience a sizeable learning curve. You will be =
working with Unix and C as it stood around 1975 and that is =
substantially different from what it was in the 80=E2=80=99s. That said, =
I know from personal experience that it is an intriguing journey and =
certainly not impossible to do.

> Some help would be nice, but more generally, is anyone on this list =
more than vaguely familiar with LSX, or 6th Edition itself?

Many on this list are familiar with 6th edition. The best way to learn =
the internals of 6th edition is the =E2=80=9CLions=E2=80=99 book=E2=80=9D:=

https://www.amazon.com/Lions-Commentary-Unix-John/dp/1573980137

Coming from today=E2=80=99s perspective (or a 1980=E2=80=99s one), you =
will find the following key challenges:

- The version of C used for 6th edition is different from the 1980=E2=80=99=
s. Amongst other things the syntax of the assignment operators changed =
(not +=3D but =3D+), the syntax for initialisation changed (not 'int a =3D=
 3', but 'int a 3=E2=80=99), the =E2=80=98long=E2=80=99 datatype (32 bit =
on a PDP-11) did not exist, the =E2=80=98void=E2=80=99 keyword did not =
exist, structs could not be assigned, passed or returned (only pointers =
to structs), etc.

- The stdio library did not exist yet, in its place there was the =
=E2=80=98portable i/o library=E2=80=99. This may be the hardest part to =
get used to.

- The file system was 16-bit based throughout. This has implications for =
stat(), lseek() did not exist (its precursor seek() used additional =
whence values to move the file pointer in 512 byte increments), etc.


When it comes to LSX, there are a few people who have experience with it =
on the this list (that I know of - there may be many more).

First of all, Heinz Lycklama, the original creator of LSX, appears to =
read this list from time to time.

Second, Leonid Broukhis and Serge Vakulenko (who managed to recover the =
LSX sources 20 years ago) might be reading the list. They took the =
trouble to port LSX to the Soviet BK-0010 computer, an LSI-11 type =
system some 15 years ago:
https://github.com/sergev/bkunix
You can stand on their shoulders, as they already took the trouble to =
convert the kernel source from 1975 C to 1980=E2=80=99s C and to create =
a stdio compatible library for it; they are using the 2.11BSD C =
compiler, which generates tighter code than the 1975 compiler =E2=80=94 =
hence they could squeeze a bit more functionality in.

Third, I found the BK-0010 port some 5 years ago and used that as base =
to create a version that would run on a small TI990 clone:
http://www.stuartconner.me.uk/mini_cortex/mini_cortex.htm
This work later evolved into a stock 6th edition kernel and is now a =
curious mix of stuff dating from 1975 to 1985.

Your main challenge will be that neither the BK-0010 work nor my work =
will run on your hardware as-is. I think you have two possible paths =
forward. The first is to learn C and the library as it stood in 1975, =
the second is to take the BK-0010 code and to make it run on a stock =
LSI-11 again.
