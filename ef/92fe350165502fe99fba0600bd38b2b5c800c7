I have a memory of a "standard" collection of patches for bugs in the version of UUCP before HoneyDanBer UUCP that I think were put together and maintained by Steve McGeady (then of Tektronix, later of Intel and other fame) which effectively became a "version" of UUCP. If one wanted to run a stable, effective site on UUCP (and USENET) one applied the patches to the UUCP sources before starting up.

Unfortunately, my google-fu has not managed to find a reference or repository of those patches ...
