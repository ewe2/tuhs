I don't think so, but I'll check.  I think all I did was set cold=1
and rebuilt.  Make sure you use my "eae" version of simh.

I'm building with the v7 asm and using "ml" to process the a.out

That looks ok.  I don't have tc setup, but that should not matter.

same here, but I don't add the "-" (not sure what that does)

Try "det rf".  I noticed that the RF device is buffered in ram
and I'm not sure it gets flushed until you detach.
