I was wondering what it would take to convert the v6/v7 basic program into
something that can be run today.

http://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V6/usr/source/s1/bas.s
or
http://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V7/usr/src/cmd/bas/bas.s

Its 2128 lines. It doesn't have that fun instruction in it :)
