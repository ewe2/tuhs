Subject: [TUHS] original vi under Linux?
Message-ID: <200611281928.kASJSu12005104@skeeve.com>

Hi. Has anyone managed to compile a version of the original BSD vi under
Linux?  I'm looking from something from the 4.3 to 4.4 vintage sources.

I made a stab at the Open Solaris version of vi, but could only get so
far.

Thanks,

Arnold Robbins
