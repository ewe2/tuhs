So long as the copyright notices, etc, are maintained...  An important
detail, but one which is worth remembering.  In the early days of
linux, there was much code borrowing from BSD w/o attribution (eg, the
copyright notices were filed off).  While most of these issues have
been corrected, it is important to note that proper forms must be
followed in order for the grant of license to be valid.
