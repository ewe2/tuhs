Subject: [TUHS] compiling festoon

Since the problem is a new library function that appeared in
the official header files in C99, it makes sense that newer
versions of gcc object.  That means that as time goes by, newer
C compilers everywhere will probably pick up the change.  Any
documentation stored next to festoon.c should definitely point
out the problem and its full generality.

We'll leave aside for now the question of whether complex
conjugation really ought to be public.
