Sorry, I should assume people know who is who, that's Bryan on the left,
Jeff is making like a chicken, Bill on the right.

Jeff and Bill were the main ZFS guys (I hired Jeff at Sun, he was one of
my students at Stanford; Bill worked for me on BitKeeper and went on to
do ZFS and then a storage startup that EMC bought for a bazillion dollars,
Bill now lives on the largest lot in Los Altos :)

Smart guys, it was fun listening to that crowd chat.
