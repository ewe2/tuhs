btw.  there is a v6 version of fsck floating around.  CMU was still running v6 when Ted did his OYOC.  he later moved it to unix/TS (aka v7) which was the release mechanics out side of BTL.   I'm wonder if I can find a readable copy. 


funny I remember the first time fsck saved our butts     we had had power failure and corrupted two file systems on the EE dept 11/34 I was running Icheck/dcheck and the like trying patch the system and getting it running a gaining.  this new grad student (tjk) says he has something he wanted to try that he wrote over the summer /he had started writing at michiga.     the machine was dead Ted had it on a tape and getting it on to an rk05 was a trick  - we ended up doing it on the IUS system in CS.  

once it was running we were in awe   man that program migrated to all the CMU pdp11s within hours
