Syntax coloring, of which IDE's seem to be enamored, always
looks to me like a ransom note. For folks who like colorized
text, Writers Workbench had a tool that can be harnessed to
do a bang-up job of syntax colorizing for English: "parts"
did a remarkable job of inferring parts of spechc in running
text.
