Huh...  Omnipage's handling of dot-matrix printouts is one of the
reasons I will only use it.  Back around 94-95, I had a student come
into the lab at the university I was working at, her floppy she'd stored
her paper on was corrupt some how (don't recall exactly why) and the
only copy of her work she had was a draft-quality print off a 9 pin
dot-matrix, and pin 4 hadn't been firing.

~120 pages, scanned on the mac and run through OmniPage, very few
'typos' from the OCR.  It impressed the heck out of me.

I won't tell, I promise.
