That would depend upon the Statute of Limitations (I'm in NSW, Australia)
and boy, can I tell some stories from the 70s/80s...

The snag is that Australia has about the toughest defamation laws in the 
world.

Let's see: the boss of XXX Dept was known to be having it off with his 
secretary (despite being married, but not to her).

Said boss was also observed rolling along the corridors in the 
afternoon, and the operators had to intervene whenever he was 
observed simply bouncing off the computer room door.

A boss of another dept was known to show his staff how to roll and smoke a 
joint.

Should we need a "sealed section"?
