Not really on topic for Unix, but historical and relevant to this
conversation and I think not well known.

In 1978 I was an exchange student working at EIR (now the Paul Scherrer
Institute), using the CDC 7600 (I think that was the model) at ETH, where
Wirth was a professor. EIR is about 30km from Z=C3=BCrich, and EIR had a re=
mote
job entry system.

The computing environment was very odd, and I asked about it. Two things I
learned:

1) The University had bought a CDC machine instead of an IBM one, somewhat
against advice, because CDC, being a smaller company, did not have the
wherewithal to translate their manuals. IBM's manuals came in German and
were all but incomprehensible as they avoided the accepted terms of art
known and used even by a German-speaking programmer. The CDC manuals, being
in English, were easier to understand, especially when considering the
nuance and precision necessary to learn the correct interpretation of the
description of a computer's execution. The Swiss, being polyglots, handled
English manuals just fine.

2) The operating system's I/O model was bizarre, but it was also unique. It
was a version of NOS locally modified, partly (if I remember right) in
support of the remote execution setup. The peculiar sequence of cards
necessary to terminate the input was due to the local changes to NOS made
at ETH. This was the system Pascal was created for, and a consequence of
the design is the idiosyncratic way input worked in early Pascal, which
made little sense to almost anyone, was seriously hard to recreate on Unix,
but worked naturally if using punch cards on, and only on, the ETH 7600.
