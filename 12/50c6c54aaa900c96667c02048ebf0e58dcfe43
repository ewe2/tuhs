LCM have atleast one 11/70 running. Although they are not really doing 
anything fun on it. I hope to maybe help them with that next time I'm 
there. I can't remember seeing any 11/45 running, but I'm pretty sure 
there are some in their storage if nothing else...

I'm not going to try dragging a lot of documentation from Sweden to 
Seattle, though (I'm not even in Sweden myself lots of the time). On the 
other hand, I know they have plenty of documentation, so I would hope 
they (and/or CHM) already have most of it.

I know of the place, and have known Rich Alderson for a long time.
It is a fun place, and I could see myself working there, if I just had 
the right offer. Don't expect that to happen, though...

I'll be there for different reasons in about a month from now. But my 
weekends are free... :-)
