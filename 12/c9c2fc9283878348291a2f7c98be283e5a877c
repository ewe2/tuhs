I know you don't support it. :-)

Yes, and it's *that* problem I'm looking for a solution to.

Freed as in "legally freed", or just "made available".

harhan.org don't exist from where my dns is looking... :-/
Another machine I have access to managed to resolve ivan.harhan.org to
208.221.139.1, but there is no response at that address.

However, if it is just the sources, and not some legal notes available,
then I don't need to go there.
