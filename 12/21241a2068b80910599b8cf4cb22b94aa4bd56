Larry:

This is really interesting. The C-like language you are referring to
here is the "L" language?

The introductory paper linked from here: <http://wiki.tcl.tk/17068> is
giving 404. Would you mind fixing the link or pointing me to another
copy of the paper? My google-fu failed to find a copy of the paper
elsewhere.
