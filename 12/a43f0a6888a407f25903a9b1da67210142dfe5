I think the "Communications of the ACM" had some articles about 
computing in the Eastern Block in June 1991.

Are you aware of the "KGB hackers" case in Germany? German hackers 
broke into systems, downloaded all data they could get, went to East 
Berlin, and sold it to the Russians. There's a nice German movie about 
the whole case, called "23". I don't know if it's been synchronized to 
other languages, but that movie is really worth watching. Full of 
historic hardware. :-)
