Subject: [TUHS] ARPAnet now 4 nodes
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.21.1712051002160.99186@aneurin.horsfall.org>

The ARPAnet reached four nodes on this day in 1969 (anyone know which?); 
at least one "history" site reckoned the third node was connected in 1977 
(and I'm still waiting for a reply to my correction).  Well, I can believe 
that perhaps there were only three left by then...
