On the good news front, I was able to find a working pi/px environment - 
4.2bsd built from tape on simulated vax780 works great (thank god vi 
works there, too) and will run the programs in the book without mods, 
out of the box. 4.3 would probably work similarly (I put it on the 
list). I tried compiling the pascal distributed via 2bsd on v7, but 
wasn't able to get it built (story of my life). This is prolly expected 
because the notes in the distro say "This is still set up for version 
6", so I'll stick with 4.2 for the time being. Just glad to have a 
working environment to supplement the reading.

Will
