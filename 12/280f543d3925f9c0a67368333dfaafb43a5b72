Abstract

The openSSI Cluster project is an ongoing open source project which was
started two years ago to bring together some of the best Linux and Unix
clustering technologies into a single integrated and yet modular project.

Linux is rich in cluster technology but is segmented into 6 different
cluster areas
- high performance, load-leveling, web-service, storage, database and high
availability. The openSSI project address all cluster environments by
simultaneously addressing the three key cluster goals - availability,
scalability and manageability.
To accomplish this ambitious goal, the project was started with a Linux
adaptation of the NonStop Clusters for Unixware code, contributed by
Compaq/HP. That code included membership, internode communication,
clusterwide process management, clusterwide devices, a cluster filesystem,
clusterwide IPC (pipes, fifos, msgqueues, semaphores, etc.) and clusterwide
tcp/ip networking. Other open source clustering code has been integrated
into the modular architecture, including openGFS, openDLM, LVS, Lustre and
a small component of Mosix. The architecture of the project allows for
subsetting and substitution of components. A full function initial release
is available in both source and RPM form. Many enhancement opportunities
still exist both in integrating with other technologies and by improving
scalability and availability.
