I was surprised that I didn't see the files at the TUHS archives.

I put the SCCS and s. files into
http://reedmedia.net/~reed/tmp/4.1c1-sccs.tar.gz
1.4MB
408 files

I was looking for the early select() code from ~1981. The earliest I 
found was kern_descrip.c from 82/07/15. I think the original source file 
got deleted or the file was renamed and lost its history (and the 
original SCCS s. file was lost).

Thanks
