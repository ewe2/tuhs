Subject: UNIX for 11/23
Message-ID: <m0tzKw7-00000DC@swift.eng.ox.ac.uk>


Having met with storming success (thanks Warren) in getting UNIX v6
and v7 up and running on my 11/34, and having recently (well
yesterday) acquired an 11/23+, I'd like to put UNIX on the latter.

Now, the 11/23 has 128Kw, a 10Mb RD51 winchester and an RX50 floppy. I
need to get hold of a version of UNIX (pref. v7) The UNIX in question
obviously needs to support the RD51. 

In the case of the 11/34 I built a UNIX image under a PDP-11 emulator
and KERMITed it to the 11/34. I plan to do the same in this case ...

Any suggestions welcome. Does v7 support RD series drives? If not,
what does?

Cheers,
Bob.

v7 doesn't support RDs (just looked thru the archive), and I don't know
of anything that does. You'd probably have to write your own device driver :-(

	Warren's correct.  MSCP support did not enter the 'BSD' picture until
	late 2.9BSD or early 2.10BSD.  TMSCP support for tapes didn't come
	about until early 2.11BSD when I "borrowed" the driver from 4.3BSD
	(who had earlier borrowed it from Ultrix).

	It should be noted that the MSCP (and to a greater degree TMSCP)
	is a *pig* - it's the largest driver in the system, rivaling the
	TTY subsystem sizewise.

	An 11/23 is already extremely cramped for address space even using
	simpler/smaller drivers such as the RK, RL, etc.  I seriously doubt
	the MSCP driver could be smashed in to a 11/23 kernel and leave room
	for too much else.

I beleive Digital's MV7 (I think) does support RDs. It is mentioned in
the 11/23+ Owners Manual. I'll have to check. I guess this version
isn't in the archive ...

Cheers,
Bob.

What about Digital's MV7 (or whatever it was called). This is
mentioned in the 11/23+ owners' manual as supported. Thus it must run
on the 11/23+ and support RD series disks. It is basically Bell Labs
version 7 I think.

OK. I guess 2.x BSD (x>=9) requires separate I+D space? That would
rule out the 11/23+ I think.

Yes. I can believe that. Looks like writing my own driver would be no
fun at all!

The 11/23+ has plenty of address space (22 bit), but mine only has 128Kw ...

Cheers,

Bob.

	True - Ultrix-11 (what MV7 was called later on) does have MSCP
	support in it.  I've not looked at how they handle the rather
	prodigious data space requirements (~2kb per controller) yet.

	Cheers.

Jacob, I'm passing this onto a bunch of PDP Unix people, as I don't have
the hardware & RT11 experience to tell you how to install v6 from the
tapes. Yes, the 3 tapes are RK05 pack images, I have on-line copies here
if that can be of any help to you. Can you raw dump the tapes to RK05s
using RT11?

Can anybody help Jacob out here? We also have v7, 2.9BSD and 2.11BSD here.
What hardware do you have?

Best of luck,

Dion, thanks very much for your email, in fact I'm ecstatic! I know this
could be a tricky legal minefield, so if possible could SCO draft a letter
(and run it past their lawyers) which sets out exactly what you said above.

In particular, you said that ``SCO would cheerfully encourage them to run UNIX
on these antiques without any payment to us''. Does this mean I can legally
distribute the source code to the PDP versions of UNIX, and to anybody? or
just to people who own PDP-11s. There are PDP-11 emulators available, so
it is conceivable that people who don't even have a real PDP-11 might like
to try UNIX out on these emulators. If to anybody, then I assume this means
the source is legally owned by SCO but freely distributable?

I really appreciate your offer of making these old versions of UNIX
available, but given the legal status of the code to this point, I would
like to cover myself with an officially blessed and signed document from SCO.
Let me know what you can do, and many many thanks again for this!

Cheers,
	Warren

Not that I wan't to sound pessimistic, but there are several
miles between "would not mind", and "legally allowed".

From what I read into his letter, he's saying that he don't think
SCO would take legal actions against us, but at the same time they
won't probably make it officially legal.

And your reply, hoping that they'll say that "Unix is legally owned by
SCO, but freely distributable", is really reaching for the sky... :-)

Anyway, keep trying, it would be very nice if they really did write
such a paper.

I know, but I really don't want to try to work under a `head in the sand'
approach from SCO. At the very least I'd like official blessing to pass
on old UNIXes to people who need/want them. I know getting SCO to allow
them to be freely redistributable is a pipe dream, but perhaps there's
some middle ground they would be willing to move to.

I'll keep you all informed of any progress with SCO.

	I submit that running an emulator does not demonstrate the proper
	degree of obsession or investment (financial as well as emotional) with 
	``antiques''.  No investment in actual old hardware is involved when 
	running an emulator.  That is, I believe, what SCO is referring
	to when mention is made of ``run UNIX on these antiques''.  Not a new
	fangled Pentium Pro running an emulator but an honest to DEC PDP-11 
	and all the dealing with 9-track (or TK-25, etc) peripherals and
	front panel or console ODT banging which that entails.

	Basically I think it would be a 'good thing' to honor the "spirit" of 
	Dion's mail item as well as the "letter" of it.

	Ummm - not freely redistributable but distributable to those who can
	at least make some sort of case that they do own a PDP-11 capable of
	running UNIX.  Granted, "proving" this over the net might be difficult
	but the effort should at least, I think, be made in an attempt to
	reciprocate SCO's spirit.

Is there really any good reason for them to object to the distribution
of UNIXes prior to SVR1?  Could there possibly be anything at all in
V7 and earlier that could in any way be damaging to SCO (or anyone
else who might buy UNIX from SCO) if it were freely distributed?  If
I'm right in assuming that it couldn't possibly make a difference to
their bottom line, perhaps SCO could be convinced to formally release
these oldest versions of UNIX?

Does anyone know, by the way, what's happening with the Lions
commentaries?  They're at the top of my "stuff I want to read" list,
and have been for quite some time now!

I suggested to Dion that SCO would get kudos from the Unix community if
they did. Haven't heard back from him yet (still Sunday there).

I have a copy of the PostScript version which floated around the 'net
a few years back. I'd be prepared to give it out on the solemn promise
that people buy Lions' commentaries when they are published.

I'll let you all know how I go with SCO.

Hi all,
	I've just been looking thru the old tapes I have here from v6 Unix,
and I think I've got two RK disk images which were laid out with the RK
driver from the Boston Children's Museum. An old email from Kevin Hill
says that the inodes are in the middle of the pack, rather than at the
beginning. However, I don't know enough about the scheme to try and
decode the files from the disk image.

If anybody can help me out, could they email me back. I've got a
program called `grab' that can extract files from v6 images, and I'd
like to modify it to get the files from these `museum' disk images.

Re: the stuff from SCO, Dion at SCO is talking to the legal guys, but
I haven't heard anything as yet.

Thanks in advance!

All,
	I browsed thru the blocks on my `Museum Format' v6 disk image,
and after a bit of work found a nice comment from the writers of the
code:

/*

 *              NHRKBLK (2435) are located beginning at block #2436,
 *              all remaining blocks are between block 1 & 2435. the
 *              effect of this mapping is to centralize disk head motion

 *              the optimization is ideal for those RK's

 *              improvement over traditional form, for RK's used 
 *              exclusively as mounted file systems.

So, after a bit of dd(1)ing, I had my two Museum Format v6 disk images
into a form which could be read with a normal v6 system.

All,
	In my continuing quest to find out if PDP-11 UNIX licenses are
available and how to get them, I've been chatting with Mike Tilson, a VP at
SCO. I include his email below, with permission. The summary is that SCO
don't have any licenses for PDP-11 UNIX; if you want a license, you should
join an organisation with an existing UNIX source license so as to be
covered by it.

	Cheers,
		Warren


    From: Michael Tilson <mike at sco.COM>
    Subject: Re: PDP-11 Unix Licenses?

[The question posed to Mike was: could cheap PDP UNIX licenses be make
 available to people who don't have licenses?]

As a former PDP-11 UNIX Fifth Edition user and systems programmer I'd
personally be pleased to see this happen.  There are some obstacles.
The UNIX intellectual property has great value (SCO gave up nearly 20%
of its equity plus future cash payments to obtain it.)  The
intellectual property traces back in unbroken lineage to PDP-11 UNIX.
Source licensing has always been very carefully managed, as this deals
with the core of the intellectual property.  Even when source was
licensed to universities "for free" there was a large agreement signed
by a university corporate authority, and the agreement had teeth in it.

The Lions book was something we all wanted to see published, but it
still took considerable careful legal review, and that was just to
publish the kernel plus a limited set of device drivers.  The full
source code (utilities, libraries, compilers, etc.) would be a bigger
matter.  (Example:  I believe the algorithms in the "diff" command for
optimal differencing are still unequaled in other commercial systems,
despite their age.)  And the later the version (e.g. Seventh Edition
rather than Sixth Edition) the more concerned we would be.

When Dion Johnson raised this matter internally a while back I
commented that I'd like to see it happen, but that I understood all of
the above concerns.  I wondered at that time whether the task of
resurrecting this historical item wasn't something that could be done
in cooperation with universities who already possessed the appropriate
source licenses.  Would that method work for you?  I note that you
appear to be associated with the right sort of institution.

So in summary I'd like to see this happen, I'll be helpful if I can,
and I would caution that the probability is considerably lower than for
the Lions book.  Dion has been doing a good job of representing your
interests, by the way.

It sounds like all the interested parties are today associated with
institutions that would allow them the necessary access for this
history project.  I've sometimes thought that I'd like to have a
PDP-11/45 running the old UNIX myself.  (The hardware can no doubt be
found in some scrapyard, the trick is floorspace and power of course.
Seems like a lot of effort to get a computer with two orders of
magnitude less capacity than my laptop computer... :-))

Please make sure everyone understands that in principle we'd like to be
helpful, but we're not dealing with a dead product, we're dealing with
an earlier version of what is today a very much alive and growing
product -- an intellectual asset of extremely high value.  This means
everyone moves very cautiously, as intellectual property law can be a
minefield.  There is no doubt that a license with enough teeth could be
written, and if we had such a license the purpose would not be to
charge historians or hobbiests a lot of money.  The real obstacle is
the care and effort that must go into creating a licensing program, and
I think the business reality is that we're unlikely to have enough idle
cycles available to create the program for you.  (Not my department,
though -- maybe Dion will be able to push it through, who knows?)

Hi Warren,

  I have visited your FTP site and have a question. The only piece of 
equipment I have connected to the net is a PC, so upon downloading a copy of

connected to the net. If the latter, could you give me some guidance on how 
this would be accomplished. Thanks again.

Keith, Warren, et al.....

1.Sorry that I've been away from this SIG after such a hectic beginning
last winter. I got sucked up in the Olympics here in Atlanta and am only
now returning to "normal" life. You boys down under might invest in a
good pair of hip boots- its coming your way ;-)

2.Thanks to all of you for your help in getting me up and running.

3.If Keith has not yet found a way to transfer files I have a set of
PD tape utilities which work quite well. As I recall I installed
TSXTCP (from shop.pdp.kent.edu) and FTP'd the files from my PC to my
11/73, built the tapes with the aforementioned utilities (TK-50, but
I believe most any style will do), booted up and installed everything
in about three days.

I'm sure that I posted a pointer to the ftp site for the tape utils
on this sig, or maybe e-mailed them to someone who requested. I'm
still not home much but drop me a line and I'll dig out the notes,
names, and etc., in the next few days...
cheers!

Danny, I just looked thru the archive and, no, you didn't post any
detais. So, would you drop a line with the info when you get back.

Thanks again!
