Well I've been able to find this much out...

The CD has some kind of weird 'live' CD filesystem to it... It would seem
that 386BSD 1.0 demanded you have an Adaptec 1542 controller hooked up, and
with special roms & whatnot it could 'boot' from the CD...  Needless to say,
this predates anything like IDE CDROM's or or what most emulators will
emulate.

That being said, they did include the 'boot' program which is touched on in
the magazine series, as a MS-DOS bootloader.

So I've just slapped together a MS-DOS floppy, with the boot & 386bsd kernel
and tried it on on Qemu, to an early kernel panic.  Oddly enough, Virtual PC
2007 can boot the kernel.  So I converted my 386BSD 0.1 install into a disk
image that Virtual PC can run, and ran the floppy, and it was able to mount
up the hard disk, run single user mode, and even go into multiuser...

If it matters this is what the boot produces:

A:\>boot 386bsd
Text 466944
Data 20480
Start 0xfe000000

I'll have to test later if it can 'mount' an ISO image that's been 'dd''d to
a hard disk.....
