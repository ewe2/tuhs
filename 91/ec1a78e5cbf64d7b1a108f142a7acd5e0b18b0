exim on a VPS.  Currently it is a linode running debian but I will have
to find an outlet that supports BSD before systemd becomes unavoidable
on debian, which I'm afraid is only a matter of time.

spam is a problem but also a challenge ;-)

I'll never switch to gmail as my primary address.  The day when it's the
only way is the day the Net dies, as I see it, and the day when I look
for a different line of work (which maybe I should have done a while ago).
