I didn't discover this one, but came across documentation of it when
researching the 3b2. (http://ferretronix.com/tech/3b2/):

The AT&T 3b2 (System V R3.2)

lboot prompts you with “Enter path name:”

It's in the source code: (/usr/src/uts/3b2/boot/lboot/subr.c)

                /*
                 * check for secret "magic mode" feature
                 */
                if (0 == strcmp(sp,"magic")) {
                    char *mp;

                    if ((mp=strtok((char*)NULL,"\r\n\t ")) == NULL || 0 !=
strcmp(mp,"mode"))
                        break;

                    MagicMode = TRUE;
                    printf("\nPOOF!");

                    if ((mp=strtok((char*)NULL,"\r\n\t ")) != NULL)
                        {
                        if (*mp == '/')
                            ++mp;

                        strcat(strcpy(slash_boot,"/"), mp);

                        printf("   A hollow voice says \"%s\".",
slash_boot);
                        }

                    printf("\n");
                    continue;
                }
