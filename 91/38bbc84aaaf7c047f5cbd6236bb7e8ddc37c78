Subject: [TUHS] 2.11 pcc with ANSI?
Message-ID: <20170116181107.B08D7400D8@vsta.org>

I'm having a lot of fun with a virtual 11/94 and 2.11.  What a lot of
excellent engineering!

It seems like an obvious project would be to adapt a newer pcc with ANSI
C support of some sort.  Has this already been done?  I'll take a look
if not.

Thanks,
Andy Valencia

p.s. The "less" in /usr/local doesn't seem to handle stty based TTY
geometry.  I re-ported "less2" from comp.sources.unix and added this.
Somebody ping me if the mildly edited sources are of interest.
