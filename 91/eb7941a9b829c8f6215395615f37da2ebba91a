This is the link to the 4.0BSD fsck version in the history repo:

https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/BSD-4/usr/src/cmd/fsck.c

To navigate to the 4.0BSD release in the repo, the process is not the
most intuitive.  Click on the top-right button labeled "Branch: master",
click on the "Tags" tab, and select BSD-4.  This drives you to
https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/tree/BSD-4.
