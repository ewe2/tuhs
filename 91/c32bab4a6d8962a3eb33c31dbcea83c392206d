Subject: [TUHS] question about SIMH tapes
Message-ID: <200306232205.h5NM5Un00269@bsd.korb>

Just to keep it Unix-like, I wrote enblock, which takes a file in stdin
a produces a tape file on stdout in SIMH-format. It takes one option,
the block size, which defaults to 512. It writes an end of file mark
after each run. To write more than one file on one tape, type

 	enblock <file1 >tape ; enblock <file2 >>tape
to write an end of tape mark, type
	enblock </dev/null >>tape

You'll find enblock.c at
	http://www.ba-stuttgart.de/~helbig/os/v6/enblock.c
