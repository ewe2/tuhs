FYI:  The KS11 MMU for the 11/20 was built by CSS and was not on the
product list as it were. To my knowledge, no hardware or prints of it
survive.    I've been told it was much more similar to the MMU in the KA10
than the scheme eventually done for the 11/45/55/70 and the 11/40 class
systems - but I think Noel has done more investigation than I have.  So if
others have more info, please chime in.

 As Warner points out the oldest code base we have is Fifth Edition.    I'm
not sure if the KS11 code is still there.  I did not think so.  I thought
it ran on 11/40 and 11/45.

The V1 work was for a PDP-7 and is before the first 11/20 was secured.  The
point is that I think there is a hole in the the SW we have.

As for RK03 vs. RK05  -- *I think I can help a little*.  RK02/RK03 used an
RK-11C.  I'm fairly sure that the RK05,  used the RK11-D controller.   The
'72 peripherals' handbook describes the former and the '76 the later.  But
if you believe the handbook, both supported 203 cylinders and 2.45M
bytes/disk with 512 byte sectors.  The difference seems to have been in
drive performance.
