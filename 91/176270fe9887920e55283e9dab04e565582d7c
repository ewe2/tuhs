Yeah.  I used it on and off, but my serious assembler programming was
on the PDP-8.  Now *that* was seriously small, but you had to know the
tricks, like how to find out the absolute address of the 128-word
memory page following the one you are on when writing PIC code for
OS/8 device drivers, or how to microprogram the operate instructions
get interesting constants into the AC.

I remember how appalled I was when I saw the VAX instruction set.
Luckily, it didn't matter: I never did assembler again.  Still, trying
to make people think in octal at this late date seems unnecessary.

/me chuckles.

Well, I know what it is but I've never written it.  There was a bug in
the V6 kernel version anyhow.

Too many others out there, alas.
