Yep; I remember now...  At nearly 65, my memory is getting a bit hazy :-)

And I've just remembered that there was a script "mved" written by Brian 
Coogan which would rename files; its usage was "mved [-n] =.c =.c.old" to 
rename *.c to *.c.old.  I have it here somewhere, and could post it if 
necessary.
