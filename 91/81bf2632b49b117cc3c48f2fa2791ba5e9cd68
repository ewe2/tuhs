As often true, I really don't disagree with you.  Around the time I left
Masscomp for Stellar we were working on a rewrite with some ex-CMU folks
(Doug ... I don't remember is his last name now) that used a preemptive RT
microkernel under the covers and then supplied RTU system calls.  Tom and I
left for Stellar and a couple of other people left too.  This was time of
the reign of Mr. Potato Head (ex-IBM guy that was named CEO) and things
blew up.
