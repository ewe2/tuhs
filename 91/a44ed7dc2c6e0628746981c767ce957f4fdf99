catalog the code at some point, but that he hasn't gotten around to it (and
not to hold one's breath).  I gathered that the tar ball he provided is a
snapshot of (a subset of?) the MWC development disks at the time he was
asked to create the archive.  To that end, I suspect that if one were
sufficiently motivated one *could* use it to build a distribution of
COHERENT, but I suspect you'd have to know quite a bit about their internal
development practices and release processes to do so successfully;
knowledge that may very well have been lost over time.  Perhaps some
motivated person will be able to reverse engineer it, though I suspect it's
more useful as a case study than as working code.
