I am not sure if this is what you are looking for, but sections 3 and
4 of "The AWK Programming Language" (by Aho, Kernighan and Weinberger)
have a description of very nice data processing scripts written in
AWK. Might even work in gawk. Might even work, actually - I had no
time to write the code into files and give it a try.

Personally, I would rather use awk for this rather than multiple
command line utilities. Might be a bit nicer to modern system with
process accounting enabled (I once wrote a shell script processing
mailbox files, plenty of echos and greps, but since then have seen the
light and I repented). On the other hand, on multiprocessor computer,
each part of pipe runs in parallel, but I guess this had been said
already.

Also, found this in my notes - if you, or anybody from a future would
like a quick glimpse on "what awk":
