I've seen rumours that it's supposed to be derived from a c compiler
output of a c compiler.
Might be true, and might not. I've been digging a little in it by now, and
it has atleast been pretty modified from that possible source anyhow.

I seem to remmeber that there was a discussion on this topic somewhere
about a year ago, but I don't remember if anyone relly knew.
