The fact that a specific copy bears a specific license may affect the
license on later copies by a means such as the GPL, but can't possibly
affect earlier copies, which are still bound by the earlier grave and
perilous license.  So you can use any SVR4 bits that are still part of
OpenSolaris freely within the terms of the CDDL, but not so any other
SVR4 bits.

I wasn't speaking of SVR4, but other non-Sun cruft that accumulated
between SVR4 and Solaris 10.
