Ron Natalie:

  My favorite 3B2ism was that the power switch was soft (uncommon then, not so
  much now).   I seem to recall that if the logged in user wasn't in a
  particular group, pushing the power button was a no-op.   You didn't have
  sufficient privs to operate the power.

Surely you mean the current user didn't have sufficent power.
