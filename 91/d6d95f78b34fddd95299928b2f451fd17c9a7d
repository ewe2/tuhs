As an offshoot of looking more closely at 32V, SysIII and 8th Edition I =
got interested in how each managed memory.

I=E2=80=99ve not deep-dived into the code yet, but from cursory =
inspection and searching past posts on this list, I get to the following =
summary:

- As has been documented widely, 32V essentially retained the V7 =
swapping architecture, merely increasing the maximum process size a bit =
versus the PDP-11 version.

- SysIII appears to have retained this, just cleaning up the source code =
a bit. I assume that all the V7/SysIII derivatives of the early 80=E2=80=99=
s were swapping systems.

- John Reiser further developed 32V memory management into a (reportedly =
elegant) demand paging system in 1980-1981, but this code appears lost.

- 3BSD/4BSD/4.1BSD developed 32V memory management into a full demand =
paging setup as well. This code base was dominant in the 1980-1985 era.

- 8th Edition pulled in the BSD VM code and is essentially identical to =
that in 4.1BSD. This choice was made because it was not a research =
interest and using a maintained code base freed up scarce time.

- SysV R1 appears to have retained the SysIII memory system.

- SysV R2 (floating about on the net, eg. here =
https://github.com/ryanwoodsmall/oldsysv) seems to have used a new =
implementation.


Questions:

Is that about correct, or am I missing major elements?

Several places mention that there was also a setup that was still =
swapping in nature, but did not require allocations in core to be =
contiguous (=E2=80=9Cscatter paging=E2=80=9D). Did this get used much in =
the era?

At first glance, the SysV R2 code seems shorter and cleaner than the =
early BSD code (~2000 vs. ~3000 sloc). Is this implementation perhaps a =
derivative of John Reiser=E2=80=99s work?=
