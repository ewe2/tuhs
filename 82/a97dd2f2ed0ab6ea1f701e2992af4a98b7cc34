The unwillingness to even attempt to solve problems like these in a
generalized and consistent manner is a source of constant annoyance to
me.  Of course it's easier to pretend that never happens on a "real"
file, since disks never, ever break.  

Of course, there are parts of the world that don't make these
assumptions, and that's where I've put my career, but the wider IT
industry still likes to pretend that storage and networking are
unrelated concepts.  I've never understood why.
