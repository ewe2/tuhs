Hi, all!
I just dug into sed.h from 32V version of sed:

gcc can't parse the following code:
union   reptr {
        struct reptr1 {
                char    *ad1;
                char    *ad2;
                char    *re1;
                char    *rhs;
                FILE    *fcode;
                char    command;
                char    gfl;
                char    pfl;
                char    inar;
                char    negfl;
        };
        struct reptr2 {
                char    *ad1;
                char    *ad2;
                union reptr     *lb1;
                char    *rhs;
                FILE    *fcode;
                char    command;
                char    gfl;
                char    pfl;
                char    inar;
                char    negfl;
        };
} ptrspace[PTRSIZE], *rep;

Does anyone know current form of that, or how to force this
to compile and work?

Thanks a lot!

S.
