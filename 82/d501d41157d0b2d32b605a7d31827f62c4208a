A related but different "thing" is when the cd activity became a
pushdown stack of 2 (is it more? I never bothered checking)

somebody realised going "there and back again" was innately useful.

(I will never forget working on systems which had cd-moral-equivalent
<down> and no cd-moral-equivalent <up> but having cd-moral-equivalent
$HOME making all directory traversals downward, or back to your
personal root)

sorry for thread hijack.
