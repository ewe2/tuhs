 why is it mt1 instead of mt0

Clem,

Thanks, that'll teach me to read the man pages more carefully even when 
the command is familiar in its modern form. Your tip about the device 
number caused me to check. Sure enough, it's in the documentation :). I 
am so impressed with the durability of the original documentation. These 
were written some 40+ years ago, and they're still amazingly useable by 
folks like me who have only worked with OSes created since the 1990's 
(of course, not entirely without help).

man tar
...
0,...,7   This modifier selects the drive on which the tape
                is mounted.  The default is 1.
