The way Rob solved the problem in acme(1) is much nicer.
Right click on |open(2)| and its man page opens up in a
new window. You can do the same on any manpage mentioned
in the SEE ALSO section or anywhere else and you can see
their man page without any side-effect on the original
window. He didn't throw out any old documentation but
added a a new tool to make navigation easier (and it is
more general in that you can define right click actions).

There was already cursor positioning available in vi. It
would not have been a real stretch to hack in acme like
support in less or vi (clumsier without a mouse but still).
In fact tag support in vi already did something like it
with ^] and ^^ for jump/back.
