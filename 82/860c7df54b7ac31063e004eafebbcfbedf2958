The problem is once you got past "One true Unix" you were left hoping 
the vendor fixed their bugs.
I saw somethings on Solaris and HPUX which were pretty much as bad as 
Windows.

The thing about Research Unix was that the underlying security structure 
was well designed.
VMS wasn't too bad either.  The problem was the stuff layered on it.

When VMS went to 3.6 or so a friend of mine was almost fired by DEC for 
randomly testing boxes looking
to see DEC's internal boxes weren't running System/Manager, 
Field/Service and UETP/UETP User/password
combinations.  DEC had just implemented new security features and alerts 
and Mitnick had just recently
penetrated them (IIRC).  Next thing you know corporate security was all 
over my buddy who was just killing
time on night shift  temporarily covering someone's vacation time.

It was interesting to see the SysV security enhanced Unix from AT&T at 
Pyramid -- who was migrating to
SVR4 from their BSD/SysV hybrid.  ACL's, split root/system and security 
mgr stuff which had been added
to get VMS to C and B2...  Some of these things had me wondering if any 
commercial sites would implement
two sign-ins to authorize special root-type actions on an os.

| Were there mistakes, yup.   But frankly, VMS had as many if not more 
and some of them were far, far worse.   IBM's OS were considered good, 
but their were documented exploits in the news there too.

The loginout.exe one was bad.  Were there any structural ones past v3.6?

Actually... I'd think AMT is an automated remote IT  Management thing 
rather than a server thing,
since it exists on all the business Thinkpads from my T61's Core 2's up 
to the T420 i5.  They couldn't
be considered servers except they do support Samba and NFS and ssh. They 
also dual boot which
is a major part of the risk.

Sorry for the pedantic add... but I just remediated my 5 laptops for 
crap that should've been fixed with
new vendor software -- but they can't be bothered.
