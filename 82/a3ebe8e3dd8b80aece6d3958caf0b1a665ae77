Hey there,

I have two questions.  First, does anyone have the original files from  
the Seventh Edition boot tape?  Second, does simh support tape  
operations like writing file markers?  No doubt you can see where I'm  
headed with this.  I want to attach the original boot tape and install  
the original V7 tape onto simh.

Thanks,
