​You might be right here, but where we disagree I think is economics.​  The
problem is that we can not afford to replace SW.   As I like to point out,
Fortran still pays my salary -- why because all the data and codes that use
that data written since the late 1950s.

Its just worse in the commercial side.  Word and Lookout/Exchange sucks -
but people use them and they are not going away.  Think about the LISP
Machine or the CM1 - lots of people though they were 'better' for some
concept of goodness.  But they failed in the end.

​I agree but ... IMO its going to take a real Christensen disruption with a
new customer base.   I just don't see that happening any time soon.
 Without a new customer base to support the new technology, the economics
of the keeping the old running has and will continue to go forward.​

​I agree and I'm a fan and cheering from the sidelines .... but I'm
skeptical of success because the economics don't play to success..​
