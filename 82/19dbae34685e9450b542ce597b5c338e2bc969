This is because 4.0 was never released outside the Bell System. When I
did contract programming at Southern Bell, they told me that the practice
was to publicly release one version behind what was running internally;
thus System III was released when they were running 4.0 in the Bell System.

They changed their minds when it came to System V, deciding to release
the current internal version publicly as well.

I also suspect that the System V doc drops all mention of IBM S/370
support for Unix.

HTH,

Arnold
