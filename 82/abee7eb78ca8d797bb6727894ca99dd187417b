Subject: [TUHS] origin of the name 'glob'

Doug McIlroy:

  One curious fact is that from day one the word hase been pronounced glob,
  not globe. (By contrast, creat has been variously pronounced cree-at
  and create.)

=====

On the other hand, the UNIX Room pronunciation of `cron' rhymed with
bone, not with spawn.
