I have the following 5 books:

The Unix Operating System Book by Mike Banahan and Andy Rutter (Copyright
1983)
A Unix Primer by Ann Nicols Lomuto & Nico Lomuto (Copyright 1983)
The Unix System by SR Borne (Copyright 1983)
Introducing the Unix System by Henry McGilton and Rachel Morgan (Copyright
1983)
A User Guide to the Unix System by Rebecca Thomas and Jean Yates (Copyright
1982)

The last one is quite interesting because it has a 13 page annotated
bibliography. Here's the earlier books:

Information and Publication Division. The UNIX System. An Easier Way to
Communicate with Computers." 1979. This has a similar title to an article
by SP Morgan in Bell Laboratories Record 56 (1978).  The rest are all
clearly articles in journals and magazines back to the original in 75.

And I have the following on the way that's been mentioned before:
Using the Unix System by Richard Gauthier Command Computer Programming 1981

So there's at least 2 books that pre-date Borne's book, maybe more. There's
a second Banahan book that I ordered, but didn't get that claims to be
1982. Trying to get to the bottom of that... All of the above are tutorials
to varying degrees, though I've only reviewed the Lomuto and Thomas/Yates
books in any detail. None appear to have useful additional historic
information.

The McGilton/Morgan book is the oldest one I've seen talk about Berkeley
Unix system. The chapter was written in the spring of 1982.

And there's this gem https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvDZLjaCJuw that I've
seen before here I think, which is dated 1982 and is a film with the same
title "he UNIX System. An Easier Way to Communicate with Computers" as one
of the items above, so I wonder if that's this film or a paper copy of it.
It's clearly Bell Labs related, though.
