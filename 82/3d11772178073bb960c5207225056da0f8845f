This is all very interesting.  However, there is one important point that I
am unclear about.  Is this a fork in SIMH development or a restructuring of
the original SIMH?  In other words, is this a continuation of the existing
SIMH effort or a fork?

Thank you.

SIMH is a framework and family of computer simulators, initiated by Bob Sup=
