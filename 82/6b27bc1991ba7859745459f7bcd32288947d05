The VAX Plan 9 kernel isn't worth anything. It never worked, was never
used, and was abandoned completely when better SMP machines started
appearing. The VAX code wasn't even ported, as I remember it; Ken and I
started over from scratch with a pair of 4-core SGI machines with MIPS CPUs
and wackadoo synchronization hardware.
