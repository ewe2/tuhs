I'd go even farther than that.  Hardware is no longer as modest, or as
simple.  And even if the target user is still the "programmer" it may
not be the case that worked well wtih the hardware and the problems of
50+ years ago is in fact that best answer today.  Including, for
example, the claim that everything should be represented in terms of a
byte stream and/or a file.

I'll refer people to the former FreeBSD core team member and currrent
FreeBSD developer, Benno Rice's presentation from linux.conf.au 2020,
"What UNIX Cost Us":

And if the Unix patriaches were perhaps mistaken about how useful
"head" might be and whether or not it should have been considered
verboten, perhaps there is something to the claim that extreme
simplicity and forcing everything to implement in terms of the
smallest, simplest operations, might not make sense.  After all, taken
to extreme, if simplicity is the only good, then instead of Intel
CPU's, or PDP-11's, maybe we should be programming everything in terms
of a Turing Computer --- after all, "small is beautiful" and even a
PDP-11 is unnecessary complexity.  :-)

Or maybe not.

One of Benno's claims is even the Unix philosophy, when taken to
extremes, can be as much of an ideology as say, Fundamentalist
Christianity.  My Episcopalean roots may be showing, but the words of
Scripture (or the writings of the Unix Patriarchs) is not the only
source of truth; and Tradition by itself is also not enough; we also
need to apply our own Reason and Experience.
