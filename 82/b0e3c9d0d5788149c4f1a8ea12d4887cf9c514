My memory is that pg was =E2=80=9Calways=E2=80=9D in AIX for the RT. The =
group of us that worked on BSD convergence deprecated pg in favor of =
more, if I recall correctly. So far I don=E2=80=99t know how to verify =
any of this.

It is also my memory that PC/IX (Sys III-based?) had pg. If so, ISC may =
have also included similar pg in both early AIX and PC/IX.
