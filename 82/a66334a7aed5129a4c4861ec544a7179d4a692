This was looooong before Cliff Stoll.  I worked at LBL for 14 years, in 
the Computer Science & Applied Math (CSAM) group.   Don't remember the 
exact dates this was happening, but something like late 60s - early 
70s.   I remember discussing with Dennis Hall the report back to DARPA 
that emphasized no value for data transfer but high value for 
communications.   (Unfortunately, Dennis is gone now.) We even had a 
"demonstration" for DARPA.  However, the nodes we needed in a couple 
places weren't in those places yet, so we "simulated" a response by 
having something in, say, San Francisco receive an internet request, 
read it with their eyes, then type in a response.  ;-)    At least DARPA 
folks were told this was a simulation.
