Good. Just wanted to make sure you wouldn't get surprised/confused 
later. :-)
No offense intended.

That said, I suspect it is not that easy to move over, as this probably 
ties very closely in to how the hardware works, and more specifically 
the MMU. Thus, an 8088 have to do things rather differently than a PDP-11.
