Hmmm...  I have this vague memory of V5 (which I only used for a couple of 
months before we got V6) not clearing that bit, but after all these years 
my memory is starting to fail me :-(

I've always thought that Xenix was insane to start with...  Then again, my 
first experience with it was on a 286...  Now, when porting Unify, should 
I use large memory model here or small memory model?  Crazy.

I don't have access to the sources right now, but I'll take your word for 
it; it was just a passing thought.
