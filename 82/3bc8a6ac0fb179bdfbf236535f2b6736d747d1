I think we may be mostly talking past each other. To me, the
underlying question began at the start of this thread (see the
subject which we should have changed a long time ago): "is there any
benefit to new sorts of programming languages to deal with the modern
multiprocessor world".

I think we're now at the point where dealing with fleets of
processors is the norm, and on the languages side, I think Erlang was
a good early exemplar on that, and now that we have Rust I think the
answer is a definitive "yes". Go's CSP stuff is clearly also intended
to address this. Having language support so you don't have to handle
concurrent and parallel stuff all on your own is really nice.
