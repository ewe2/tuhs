Well, some people find it useful.  But if you want dash or Unix rc,
you know where to find them.

Indeed.  I rather like the Chicken Scheme approach:  there is a Makefile
fragment for each supported architecture, currently BSD, Solaris, Android,
AIX, Haiku, iOS, MinGW with or without MSYS, Cygwin, Hurd, MacOSX,
and Linux.  If you want anything else, provide your own Makefile fragment.
