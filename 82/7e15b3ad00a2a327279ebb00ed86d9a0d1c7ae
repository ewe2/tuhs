I think the execs did not fully appreciate what they had in SunOS.
I know that I, and many other engineers, put in a boat load of extra
effort to polish SunOS.  My first job at Sun was to do POSIX conformance
(which was one hell of an education).  Nobody asked me to do this,
but I made lint libraries for SVr3 (or 4, whatever was current), BSD,
POSIX, etc.  My thinking was that you could develop on SunOS but target
whatever you wanted.  I had to threaten to quit to get them included in
the release, Rob didn't want them in there because they added something
like 40KB to the install.  He was probably right, I doubt anyone ever
used them, but my thinking was to help the customers.  

That thinking was rampant amongst the engineers, you could show up at 7pm
and building 5 had piles of engineers polishing SunOS.  Guy Harris quit
and went to Auspex, they licensed SunOS.  He'd come pound on the door
after dinner, we'd let him in, get him logged in and he fixed bugs.
I can still here him saying "Holy smokes, they still haven't fixed
this?" and then he'd check in a fix.

I don't think the execs had a clue as to how much the engineers were
willing to make SunOS better.  We did it because everyone wanted a
Sun, it was the best of the best at the time.
