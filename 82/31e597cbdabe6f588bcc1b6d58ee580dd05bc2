Subject: [pups] BSD2.11 Floating Point Simulator
Message-ID: <yHnWMXAihd85EwLN@ruffnready.co.uk>

Dear All,
I am currently looking at making the 2.11 FP simulator work.
Unfortunately I don't have a non floating point PDP to check things on.
Can some one who has please try running some FP code on the Generic
Kernel for 2.11 and let me know what happens.  I am slowly going through
the code but some symptoms would be useful.  

regards

Robin
