But why would you include an a.out header in a boot block?  When you only 
had 512 bytes, every one of 'em counted, and I, oops, I mean others, had 
to resort to vile stuff such as self-modifying code...

I heard a story that on sufficiently-early Unices, the header was indeed 
loaded, hence the "407".

Any grey-beards here like to comment?
