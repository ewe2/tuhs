Tyler - I'm with Jon on this.  I'll pick on Apple here.  It used to be a
huge difference between MSFT SW and MacOS was that the systems folks at
Apple really tested the system and the result was that Mac OS with way
really stable.   My system never panic'ed except when I ran Windows under
parallels.   After 3-4 years ago, that stopped being true.  Crashes occur,
just like Windows BSD.   It's not unusual for my Mac to panic just letting
it run overnight - which is just backups and the like.  Yes, I have a
multiple monitors, a zillion windows open etc..


I come downstairs and the screen is blank (it should be, I have it turn off
after no activity), but I move the mouse or try to type something  --
nothing wakes the system up again.  I've chased it to Mac OS running out of
memory and not gracefully handling the lowe memory situation.  Sad, I have
16G of RAM a 1T SSD and many TB of memory on Thunderbolt 3 connectivity.

Look I grew up with a 256K byte RAM Unix V6 system on an 11/34, 3 RK05s and
an RK07 for storage.  We swapped.  Yeah, I never ran a window manager, but
he had a number of 9600K terminals on DH11's and we were happy.  You could
see it swapping like mad, but that system never crashed.  It just ran and
ran and ran.

IMO, this is what I think Jon is referring.   Those systems were stable
because we tested them and found and fixed the issue.   These days, Apple
no longer cares about Mac OS because iOS is where they now put their
effort, although I'm not super impressed there either, but I also don't
push it like I do Mac OS.  Sad really.   If I could get the day-2-day
applications that I need to work on FreeBSD, I suspect I would be there in
a heartbeat.
