	A project--buiilding a device to plug into a PDP-11's bus (or
	LSI-11)

Hello from Gregg C Levine
I never had the chance to post this here, but one of my reasons for
joining our group, was that I was in the process of designing
something to plug into a PDP-11's bus, (or an LSI-11). I never
accomplished it, because I didn't have the parts here. Nor the
computer either to try out my design. I've now discovered that this
company, Luke International, http://www.lukechips.com/ which was
formed by a group of former AMD engineers, is selling the parts
someone would use to clone a PDP-11 processor.

And indeed the AM2908 matches those bus specs. 

I also recall that the processor in question at one point in its
lifespan, actually used the AM2901 family of bit-slice processors. The
design is still going through the drawing board status, but now that
I've found a place that sells those parts means I am much closer.

Regarding those systems, if someone in the US, and preferably the NYC
area has a PDP-11/53, or an LSI-11, hanging around, please contact me.
