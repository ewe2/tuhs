obviously not speaking for my employer here, but my understanding is
that you can't power up all the existing real-estate on modern silicon
and still meet power envelopes.  the extra silicon isn't wasted: it
merely functions as a heat-sink when it's not being utilized.  :)

are there any synthesizable (hardware description language) versions of
PDP or VAX available?  seems like hybrid FPGA / SW emulation platforms
would be an interesting experimentation space.
