Working on a new project that's unfortunately going to require some changes
to the linux kernel.  Lived a lot of my life in the embedded world, haven't
touched a *NIX kernel since 4.3BSD.  Am writing a travelogue as I find my way
around the code.  Wasn't planning another book but this might end up being
one.  Anyway, a few questions...

Was looking at the filesystem super_block structure.  A large number of the
members of the structure (but not all) begin with a s_ prefix, and some of
the member names are in the 20 character long range.  I recall that using
prefixes was necessary before structures and unions had their own independent
namespaces.  But I also seem to recall that that was fixed before long
identifier names happened.  Does anybody remember the ordering for these two
events?

Also, anybody know where the term superblock originated?  With what filesystem?

Jon
