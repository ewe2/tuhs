I=E2=80=99m still researching John Reiser=E2=80=99s 32V with demand =
paging, copy-on-write and mmap.

Unfortunately, JFR does not have the bits or a listing for this version =
of 32V.

I=E2=80=99ve read the MSc theses of Leffler and Shannon with interest =
(https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Documentation/Theses/). The thesis of =
Shannon has an interesting discussion of a demand paged version of his =
Harris/6 Unix (Chapter 5). It is based on the Tenex ideas, just as JFR =
mentioned for his version. The thesis of Leffler contains a gant chart =
that shows that the demand paged version was written in the first months =
of 1980 -- concurrently with or slightly after the 32V version.

I=E2=80=99ve also (superficially) read the papers on Tenex memory =
management. The design is closely tied to PDP-10 MMU that BBN designed =
for Tenex. Some of its data structuring is recognisable in Shannon=E2=80=99=
s version. One defining aspect is that the design for both is for a =
virtual address space that is smaller than the physical address space; =
on a 1980 VAX it was the reverse.

If 32V followed the same design ideas (a big if), it most likely limited =
processes to a capped address space (e.g. 2MB). It might also have =
contained an in-core flag/data vector with as many entries as there are =
pages frames in swap space. If true, these downsides may have been why =
it did not go on to become the root for SysVR1 or R2 paging.

The demand paging code for SysVR2 was written by Keith A. Kelleman and =
Steven J. Buroff, and in contemporary conference talks they were saying =
that they wanted to combine the best parts of demand-paged 32V and BSD. =
They may have some additional memories that could help with getting a =
better understanding of the final version of 32V.

Does anybody have contact details for these two gentlemen?
