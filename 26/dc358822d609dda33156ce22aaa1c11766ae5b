Yes, correct:

  $ TZ=3DAmerica/Los_Angeles date -j 196910292230 +%s
  5419800
  $ TZ=3DUTC date -r -5419800
  Thu 30 Oct 1969 06:30:00 UTC

That's in the time zone sources:

  # Rule NAME	FROM	TO	TYPE	IN	ON	AT	SAVE	LETTER/S
  Rule	US	1967	2006	-	Oct	lastSun	2:00	0	S
  Rule	US	2007	max	-	Nov	Sun>=3D1	2:00	0	S

So in 1969, DST ended on 26 October.

Of course, this didn't happen at *exactly* 22:30/6:30, but presumably
nobody at the time thought that people would still be talking about it
50 years later.
