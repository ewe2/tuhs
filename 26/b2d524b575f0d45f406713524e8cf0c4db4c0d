Indeed, that's cheap. When I started out back in ... thinking .... '99 
with my first own domain, there were not that many offerings for hosting 
at the cost for (then) DSL plus static IPs. Had there been offerings 
this low back then I might have opted for that.

But, I liked the way to have physical control over my setup, still do, 
so there was, is no reason to switch at this time. Given different 
circumstances, I might.
