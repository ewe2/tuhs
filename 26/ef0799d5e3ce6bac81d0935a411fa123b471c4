I started off with troff (on Suns) and then the dep't installed (La)TeX.  I
switched to LaTeX because I was writing math and it looks better in the
latter (as Knuth intended).  I dabbled with TeX but never stuck to it -- too
much like assembler.  Interestingly, the secretarial staff learnt TeX and
the grad students all used LaTeX.

At work, we once used noweb (and xfig and pstex) to document our code.
This was well before doxygen and I think it worked fairly well (despite the
extra steps).
