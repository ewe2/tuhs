PC did his original development on a Masscomp box which was basically 4.2
APIs and was one of the original X systems (its what ORA did the original
doc and how Tim got his start).  Paul is a Mac guy (at one point it
compiled on the 68K Mac OS) and he moved the development there at one
point.  So, I suspect it will build without too much difficulty on *BSD
style systems (and he might even answer a question or two if you run into
issues).

I suggest try it and see how far you get.   The biggest issue is the video
calls were for older versions and I don't think they talk to modern API's;
but I suspect on the Mac the X windows system will work fine.

Then again, I have not tried it in years and I'm not sure at this point, I
could pull teco commands out of my long paged out personal memory system.
