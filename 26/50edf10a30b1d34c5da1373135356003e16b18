Michele,

Some time ago, SCO made its source code available under an "Ancient UNIX" license.  That is also very close to SVR4.  I don't have the details at hand, but perhaps someone on this list does.

Is there a reason you need to see the source code specifically for SVR4?

Cheers,

Jim

OpenSolaris is derived from SVR4 and much of the userland stuff is
still quite similar to the original release. Sadly, System V as a
whole is still regarded as a commercial product and no source is
available. If you want the source code for a decent early-90s Unix
implementation, I'd take a look at 4.4BSD. It's not SVR4, but it's
from the same era and has many of the same abilities.

Mike
