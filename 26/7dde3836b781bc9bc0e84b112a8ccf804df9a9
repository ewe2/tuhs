I can't agree more, it would even be more than ultra cool to be able 
to boot Unix 6th Edition directly on your PC.
But I can't make a complete (and everything else would be senseless) 
port on my own as this would from my point of view mean to much work 
for a single individual. I try to do as much as I can but if you want 
to get a real port we've to found an open source project for reaching 
this aim.

Well, this are details. The question to be answered before we can 
start thinking about them is this one above: Do we start an open 
source project for porting Unix or not?

You should notice that it is dangerous to talk about the EURO with 
me. I always become very aggressive... ;-)
