Sorry to reply to myself, but I wanted to add one note to this, and 
didn't, which pertains to the "rename" versus "update" part of file 
protections in TOPS-10, and perhaps was a bug that was never fixed, or 
it was, and I didn't know it.

In TOPS-10, you use the monitor call ENTER to update (write to) an 
existing file. It uses a common argument list with LOOKUP and I think a 
few other calls, that include the file name and extension. If a file had 
a 4 protection code for you, you could LOOKUP the file, then ENTER it 
with a different filename, and the filename would change, effectively 
renaming the file which you would think required a 1 protection code. 
You could also, if I recall correctly, specify a different protection.

The significance of this? Many installations put files in SYS: ([1,4]) 
that had a 4 protection code so they could be written to by various 
applications users ran, or it was an oversight by a system 
administrator. Using DDT, one could easily whip up a short piece of code 
to rename any file in SYS: that had a 4 protection code, rename it to a 
.SAV or .SHR (if it needed a highseg) and basically "hide" behind 
another program, such as LOGIN.EXE (When EXE was introduced, I think in 
version 6, TOPS-10 still supported .SAV, .SHR, and .HGH but would 
attempt to run the .EXE first if you didn't specify an extension).

Certain programs in SYS: like LOGIN had JACCT privileges - full rights 
to everything, including device I/O. So, find a writable file in SYS:, 
rename it to LOGIN.SAV, copy PIP over it, or something you cobbled up 
yourself, and take over the system without causing any other issues 
except that missing writable file.

JACCT priv was much like "setuid" in UNIX - except it was a hardcoded 
list of filenames in the monitor (I think mostly or exclusively in SYS:) 
that would get carte blanche access to everything. I believe by version 
7, some programs had been deprecated out of SYS, but they still existed 
in the JACCT list in the monitor.

And boy, there were a lot of systems out there on Telenet or the ARPANET 
that had files in SYS: protected with a 4. Side note: Telenet was BBN's 
attempt to create a private sector ARPANET. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenet - A late night dumpster dive at 
Radio Shack in the very early 80's got me a local dialin number.

Sorry for the lengthy dissertation :)
