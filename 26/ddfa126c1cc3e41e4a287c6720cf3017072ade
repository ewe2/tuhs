Not that great a difference.  Both Oz and the US have a very similar
Federal/state structure.  Getting US Federal funding for an Oz site
is unlikely (but the LoC is going to need to work out how to handle
the fact that the Internet doesn't acknowledge national boundaries
and some of the information it needs to archive won't be in the US).
