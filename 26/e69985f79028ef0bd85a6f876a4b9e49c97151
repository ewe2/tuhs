There are at least 2 versions of Datakit. I my current understanding =
there are =E2=80=9CDatakit=E2=80=9D which is the research version, and =
=E2=80=9CDatakit II=E2=80=9D which seems to be the version that was =
broadly deployed into the AT&T network in the late 80=E2=80=99s -- but =
very likely the story is more complicated than that. Plan9 is =
contemporaneous with Datakit II.

In short, Sandy Fraser developed the =E2=80=9CSpider=E2=80=9D network in =
1970-1974 and this was actively used with early Unix (at least V4, maybe =
earlier). Sandy was dissatisfied with Spider and used its learnings to =
start again. The key ideas seem to have gelled together around 1977 with =
the first switches being available in 1979 or so. The first deployment =
into the Bell system was around 1982 (initially connecting a handful of =
Bell sites).

In 1979/1980 there were two Datakit switches, one in the office of Greg =
Chesson who was writing the first iteration of its control software, and =
one in the office/lab of Gottfried Luderer et al., who used it to =
develop a distributed Unix.

Datakit at this time is well described in two papers that the ACM =
recently moved from behind its paywall:

https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1013879.802670  (mostly about 1980 =
Datakit)

https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/800216.806604  (mostly about =
distributed Unix)

The Chesson control software was replaced by new code written by Lee =
McMahon around 1981 (note: this is still Datakit 1). The Datakit driver =
code in V8 is designed to work with this revised Datakit. Three aspects =
of Datakit show through in the design the V8-V10 networking code:
- a separation in control words and data words (this e.g. comes back in =
=E2=80=98streams')
- it works with virtual circuits; a connection is expensive to set up =
(=E2=80=98dial=E2=80=99), but cheap to use
- it does not guarantee reliable packet delivery, but it does guarantee =
in-order delivery

Probably you will see echoes of this in early Plan9 network code, but I =
have not studied that.
