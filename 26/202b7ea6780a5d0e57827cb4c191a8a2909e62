You might be right i don’t exactly remember the dates of each release.  that said I do remember  Mach ran on a number of systems before Next, but they were not commercial.  It was similar to BSD where CMU ported to that hardware - I’ve forgotten the name of the guys that spun out of DG that had an early MP based system that used reflected memory- but I remember CMU had very early version of Mach running there that was based on the 4.1mash up like the original Vax code from CMU that they started.  

The point is that early Mach was working before 4.2 way final and released to the DARPA community not much later. CRSG was doing Val support for DARPA and CMU was more researchy (which was a point of contention in a lot of fronts that I’ll not scratch open any further).

I was not commenting on the implementation of the goodness of the CMU or CSRG code by the wsy.  Sun could have had the first commercial version of shared libs that worked well, although IBM might have been around the same time as Charlie pointed.  

What had Paul asked when shared libs came to being for Unix.  I was trying to say it did not come from any one point.  I do believe Mach and it’s parent Accent (which was not Unix) was the first time any Unix had it but like BSD was a DARPA funded project and not commercial. But a lot of different places were working on the idea as it was commonly held to be an issue with Unix. 

Also, joy / BSD 4.2 was heavily influenced by Accent (and RIG )and the Mach memory system would eventually go back into BSD (4.3 IIRC) - which we have talked about before wrt to sockets and Accent/Mach’s port concept. 

FWIW If I'm remembering the sequence right I believe Mach 2.5 was quickly created as a update to the original release after joy et al released the final 4.2.  4.1c was 83 as I was leaving UCB and I brought it with me.  But  I think we had an early 4.1 based Mach tape at Masscomp not too much later ??a year maybe??  And one of the reasons we were interested in it was the shared library code because the exVMS at Masscomp all felt that was a deficiency of Unix and at the time the only ‘open source’ in a HLL if you will that had it was Mach.
