I have to say my experience in UNIX systems programming was due to the=20
discovery of a trojan.   It also shaped my research into security on=20
UNIX and other systems over the coming decades.

At the time, the UNIX system at Johns Hopkins University (there was only=20
one) in the EE department was run by an undergraduate activity called=20
the "University Computing Society."    This bunch, headed by Mike Muuss=20
and another covered all aspects of running the computer:  programming,=20
operations, hardware, and documentation support.    I was just a loose=20
hangar on at the time, writing my first C programs and the like.

A couple of student operators managed to get access to what would be the=20
installed copy of /lib/crt0.o (the small snippet inserted at the=20
beginning of all C programs).   They inserted a couple of bytes that did=20
an exec of a file "^V" (current directory) and then waited.   Most of=20
the time, this is a harmless change as there is no ^V file in the=20
current directory.    Then, one day they hit the jackpot and a setuid=20
root program got rebuilt and now they had a way of getting a root shell=20
easily.

This went largely undetected as they used it for quasi-productive uses=20
for a while.   One day one of the other programmers was rebuilding a=20
program and noticed the few byte increase in size (back then we were=20
running the system on a grand total of 8.5MB so every byte was=20
precious).   Subsequent analysis of what changed revealed the trojan.   =20
This led to an upheaval in the department and the end of the UCS.   They=20
did decide to keep the cheap student labor however, and since I had kept=20
my nose clean and had some extensive, albeit, non-UNIX programming=20
experience, I was brought on board.    I spent the next three and a half=20
years looking for and plugging security holes.

I went on (after a brief stint at Martin Marietta) to work for Mike at=20
Aberdeen Proving Ground and continued doing random security work=20
including being put on the Army's initial tiger team effort.    Also,=20
there used to be a discussion in the security groups about what a=20
"hacker with a Cray" could do for things about brute forcing decryption.=20
    I was given use of the new X/MP the Army bought to see if that was a=20
feasibility.    I later got to purchase a $25 million Cray 2, but left=20
BRL for Rutgers before that was delivered.
