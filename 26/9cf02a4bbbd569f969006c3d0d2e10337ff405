Subject: [TUHS] UNIX on S/370
Message-ID: <CAJfiPzxnwNdAHLRV4+QUF-k-ib4tuFj5BLy-r-jL9W7zHHziQw@mail.gmail.com>

Recent commentary on porting led me to read the article on porting
UNIX to S/370 (https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/otherports/ibm.pdf)
to support 5ESS development because the existing PDP11s were being
overwhelmed.  I confess to not having this read this before and find
it interesting.  Any recollections from anyone on the matter.  And
whatever happened to it?
