Oh, I don=E2=80=99t mind sharing on-list! I just bought the board=E2=80=94=
and a system controller, and some additional RAM boards, as well as the =
VME chassis with built-in PSU=E2=80=94on eBay. Lots of sellers are =
willing to make pretty good deals. There=E2=80=99s barely anything I =
paid over US$100 for, and I=E2=80=99ve only been collecting the VME =
stuff for a couple years.

In theory you should be able to use any VME or VXI chassis for most VME =
hardware. What=E2=80=99s hard to find are manuals for anything not on =
Bitsavers[1], or software to run on it. At least NetBSD has been ported =
to the common 68030+ and PowerPC VME boards, and an old version of =
OpenBSD runs on the common 88K ones. Alas the 133 doesn=E2=80=99t have =
an MMU so it=E2=80=99s going to be a bit more restricted.

One of the reasons to run MINIX 1.5 on my MVME121 is that it should be =
nice and fast on a 10MHz system with 8.5MB of RAM (including 4KB of =
cache), and as a V7 UNIX clone with an ANSI C compiler it=E2=80=99ll be =
easy to write for and port to. It=E2=80=99ll probably also be nicer than =
running one of the first few versions of Motorola System V/68 on it too, =
since I think that=E2=80=99s SVR1=E2=80=A6

Your 133 should also be straightforward to port MINIX to as well, since =
all the hardware=E2=80=99s simple, standard, and documented in the =
manual (plus data books).

My plan was to start with MINIX 1.5 on Atari ST under Hatari, then just =
write some device drivers and a boot loader to replace the ST-specific =
ones.

  =E2=80=94 Chris

[1] Or Artisan Technology Group=E2=80=99s web site; they sell a ton of =
used VME hardware, and seem to collect what manuals and data sheets they =
can and provide them as PDF.
