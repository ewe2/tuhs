What I ended up doing for children of GUI apps (on OSX) is to fork very early on
before the GUI starts, or the process becomes multi-thread.  Then that child does
all of the real spawning, using fd passing and messages over a pipe (actually a
unix domain socket) to drive it, so usually no need for _np stuff.
There for cases where posix_spawn() is viable, as I recall it was faster than fork+exec.
