I'm using Taylor UUCP on a somewhat modern system (Ubuntu 12).

I managed persuade it to connect to seismo over TCP port 5000 and do a
handshake for protocol g.  A few packets were sent.

Now I'll see if I can inject email messages into this.  We're using the
exim MTA, and it's does exactly support uucp.
