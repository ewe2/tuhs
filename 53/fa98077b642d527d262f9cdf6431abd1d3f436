'stty {mumble} > /dev/ttyX', in case that wasn't clear.

Note that this only works if you have a working shell on _another_ terminal,
so if you're e.g. working with an emulation which has only one working
terminal, and your raw-mode program on it has gone berserk, 'See Figure 1'.
It really is advised to have another working terminal if you want to play
with raw-mode programs.
