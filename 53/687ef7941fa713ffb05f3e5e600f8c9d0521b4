Hi Noel,

Thank you for highlighting this document. I had seen it before and the =
implementation (as found on the tapes from CSRG and now on THUS) follows =
the plan outlined in IEN168 quite closely. The first snapshot of the =
code is just a few months after this document.

In a way it is modeled after the UoI Arpanet Unix implementation (and =
thank you again for finding that source!), with a separate (kernel) =
process for network activity. In my experiments I have found that it is =
not all that easy to get smooth network data flow as this network =
process is difficult to schedule just right. I now better understand why =
Joy moved to "software interrupts=E2=80=9D to get better scheduling of =
kernel network operations.

Wbr,

Paul
