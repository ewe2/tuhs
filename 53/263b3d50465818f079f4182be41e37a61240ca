It always made me wonder what they were hiding - piles of stuff being 
pushed/popped to the stack that a goto would leave hanging?

I eschew gotos myself, especially in C. I don't use them. When I get to 
the point in a program that I think about using one, I go back and 
re-write the logic so it doesn't need one.

I do not, however, look down on people who DO use them. I've used them 
in the past for efficiency, just not lately. You can get away with them 
in C because there's no magic going on, besides what the optimizer does.

I never understood the "crash and burn" logic either.

Maybe you should come up with a new C standard ;)
