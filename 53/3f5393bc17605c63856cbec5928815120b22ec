Paul - you are correct that its got a lot of it there and in particular the
kernel (which is good).  But the /usr directory (and thus /usr/src) is
missing.  It's not a completely distribution, it's the BBN 4.1 TCP
distribution which was a subset.

As I said, 4.0 and 4.1 were similar, but different.

The trick is find a complete 4.1 distribution tape.
