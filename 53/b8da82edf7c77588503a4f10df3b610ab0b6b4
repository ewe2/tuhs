On page 3 of the Research Unix reader (http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/reader.pdf).

"Sandy (A. G.) Fraser devised the Spider local-area ring (v6) and the Datakit switch (v7) that have served in the lab for over a decade. Special services on Spider included a central network file store, nfs, and a communication package, ufs."

I do not recall ever seeing any SPIDER related code in the public V6 source tree. Was it ever released outside Bell Labs?
