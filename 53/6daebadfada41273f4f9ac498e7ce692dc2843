I was speaking in jest... But the (official) awk grammar has been an
eye-opener for years.

 but it didn't affect much of what I did.  There was a paper out of Stanfor=
d about that time that influenced me greatly -- it was about pattern matchi=
ng languages, and proposed separating two ideas: 1.  "Here are the patterns=
 that match this tree".  And 2.  "If more than one pattern matches, here's =
how to decide which one to use."   Given the constraints of size on the PDP=
 11, anything but LR(1) was infeasable.  But using ambiguous grammars and b=
roadening the shift/reduce test to trest operator precedence fit right into=
 that pattern.   Another thing that I think was unique to Yacc at the time =
was introducing symbols that matched the empty string whose reduction cause=
d program actions.  Many similar parser systems at the time could not deal =
with these "empty" symbols.
