Hi Larry,

It's awful.  :-)
st.st_size `stutters' and that jars when reading in my head.
If st.size isn't clear from context, then stbuf.size probably is.
Ditto ar_hdr->uid versus hdr->ar_uid.

There's a hierarchy to walking the data structure, and that should be
represented in the identifiers.  So big.little, not b.bg_little.
