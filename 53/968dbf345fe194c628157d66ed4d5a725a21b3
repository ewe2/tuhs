Warner Losh and I have been discussing the early history of John
Lions' "A commentary on the Sixth Edition UNIX Operating System".
I've been hosting Warren Toomey's version (with some correction of
scan errors) at http://www.lemis.com/grog/Documentation/Lions/ for
some years now, and my understanding had been that the book hadn't
been published, just photocopied, until Warren posted it on
alt.folklore.computers in 1994.  But now it seems that the "book" had
been published by UNSW when Lions held the course, and only later was
the license revoked.  Does anybody have any insights?  What
restrictions were there on its distribution?  What was the format?
Was it a real book, or just bound notes?

Greg
