Never used their support.  I keep nothing 
important on the server. 

I back up my stuff to my house over SSH with rsync. 

They have zfs snapshots and a remote console over web browser, so if I break it I fix it or reinstall.

If I get into too much trouble they do have support.  I am running from the bootable install they supplied and I used freebsd-update to go from 10.3 to 11.1 IIRC.

I try to choose my words carefully, and here I wrote "supports" on
purpose even though it is a much overused word.

Linode will let me run FreeBSD, no problem, but they will not support
it.  That means, for example, no backups.

So when you write that DO "does" FreeBSD, how far do they go on the
support scale?
