I guess I'm just a curmudgeon.

I can't be arsed to care that much about Notepad supporting unix new line.

Wordpad, which ships with Windows (even if it's not installed by 
default), has supported unix new line for as long as I can remember.

So … I don't feel Notepad supporting unix new lines to be that big of a 
deal.

What am I missing?
