There is a 4.0 floating around, that Nao got running... You can find
his notes here:

As for making tape images, it's easy if you have access to a working
perl interpeter..(I use SFU/SUA under Windows...)

I have a few examples here:

If you have access to file dumps of the tapes, it would *PROBABLY* be
trivial to get them into something simh understands and get something
booting...  If the asm for the tape load doesn't work, I've had great
luck manually running the bootra program, and pointing it to a copy of
the rootdump..

Where is your source for 4.1c?  Perhaps it's similar enough to 4.0 or
4.2 that it could be setup with either......
