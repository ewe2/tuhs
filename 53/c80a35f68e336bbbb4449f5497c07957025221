This is an excellent idea.  Count me in, and count a vote for
Mediawiki while you're at it.

I'm in two minds about this.  On the one hand, it makes perfect sense.
On the other, part of the advantage of things like Wikipedia is that
everything's in one place.  I honestly don't see the TUHS people being
active enough to produce anywhere like as much material as is already
present on Wikipedia.

Wikipedia has various "projects" which concern themselves with certain
subtopics (or they had them; looking at various pages, I can no longer
see any hints).  Does anybody know more details?  If we could find a
way to get a few knowledgeable, active people to ensure the
consistency and accuracy of UNIX-related articles, that could be a
better approach.
