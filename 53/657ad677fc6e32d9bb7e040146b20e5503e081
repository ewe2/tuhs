For networking, you need to:
   compile simh with networking support
   edit 211bsd.simh to
     attach to the correct network device
     use the hardware address that you want
   Inside the system, you will need to edit /etc/hosts and /etc/netstart
   to configure your hostname and networking options.
   Reboot

As for getting a bigger disk, you've got two options.  Reinstall on a 
larger disk image, or just mount a larger disk image onto the file system.

To reinstall, read the directions in README.networked.211BSD and 
docs/2.11bsd_setup.txt .  If you do a fresh reinstall, you will need to 
recompile the kernel (as described in docs/2.11bsd_setup.txt) to get 
networking support.

Or you can create a second, larger, disk image with dd, attach it, and 
label, format, and mount it from within the emulator.

Best of luck,
Andru
