What is everyone's experience with source code OCR?  I have tried it a
few times, and the resutls haven't been that good.  In my experience
it's about as much effort as typing it manually.

I'm working on a GRAPHICS-2 simulation so we can run Space Travel.
Obviously I'd like a machine readable version of the program.  However,
I'm not volunteering to do all the typing myself.
