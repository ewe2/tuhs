Solaris is derived from Sys V, and the source is readily available to 
educational institutions.  It could be a help...  (though I warn you, they
kernel in particular has a changed a LOT from stock Sys V)

Remember that vanilla sys V source is still nominally under NDA for whoever 
has it, so I wouldn't bet on getting it...
