Says you.  I was running it in at least 1995.

So in all of this, the thing that keeps getting missed is Linux won.
And it didn't win because of the lawsuit, it didn't get crushed by the
GPL that all the BSD people hate so much, it won on merits.  And it
won because there was one Linux kernel.  You could, and I have many,
many times, just clone the latest kernel and compile and install on
any distribution.  It worked.  The same was never true for all the BSD
variants.  Tell me about the times you cloned the OpenBSD kernel and
it worked on FreeBSD.  I'm maybe sure there was maybe one point in time
where that worked but then for all the other points in time it didn't.

Like I said, I built and supported a very complex application on all the
Linux platforms, all architectures, also supported on *BSD, HP-UX, AIX,
IRIX, SunOS, Solaris, Ultrix, etc, windows{xp,2000,2008,etc}, MacOS.
The problems I had between the various BSDs were orders of magnitude
bigger than the problems I had between the various Linux distros we
supported.

I will admit that we cloned NetBSD's stdio library because we needed
to make changes to it (we stacked CRC, XOR, gzip, lz4, etc on it). 
So we side stepped any stdio issues but for the rest we just made it
work.  

So my actual data trumps your opinion on this one.  The BSD splintered 
enough that they might as well have been IRIX and HP-UX, they weren't
as crazy as AIX, I think AIX wins crazy, but they were dramatically
more different, in subtle and annoying ways, than any Linux distro was.

My whole point is that if BSD had a focus, either a dictator or a 
steering committee that people like me would have followed, it would
have won.  It lost.  It sucks that it did, I'm a BSD guy in my core,
but BSD lost.  And it lost because of a failure in leadership.

You and the other BSD people don't like that message but it is what it
is.  BSD lost because Linux had better leadership.
