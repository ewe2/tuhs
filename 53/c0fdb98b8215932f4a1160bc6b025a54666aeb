So the only one I was involved in was the CVS hack to the Linux kernel
source tree.  This was back in the early 2000's and the kernel used
my SCM system, BitKeeper, but there were people who didn't like the 
license.  We built an exporter that exported the history to CVS (it
was a pretty nice exporter, on a per file basis it would find the 
longest path through a DAG and export that since CVS was straight
line, not a DAG.)

Me being me, I trusted nothing, so as part of the export process I
compared the checked out BitKeeper tree to the checked out CVS tree.
And found that someone had broken into the machine that hosted the
CVS tree and stuck a back door into the source.

I take umbrage at the reporting there, they said it was many eyes (the open
source mantra) that found it, that's bullshit, it was my eyes that found it.

I have fond memories of taking over a machine using and NFS /home filesystem exported to the wide-world, of someone trying to hack into my MasPar via the DEC Ultrix which controlled it, etc. but I am really rather interested in other perspectives.
