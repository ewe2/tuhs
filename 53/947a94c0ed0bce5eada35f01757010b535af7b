Folks,

I recently copied down the 32V source, and compiled the kernel with gcc.  Much 
to my surprise, most of it compiled.  I then split out the machine dependent 
versus the machine independent files (loose classification :-), and compiled 
again.  Naturally, in both cases, you could not actually build a kernel because 
there are vax specific .s files, but the individual C files compiled.  Not a bad 
start.

As a result, I've been giving serious consideration to porting it to Intel IA32 
platforms.  It's much simpler than the unix I worked on until last year (Tru64, 
aka OSF/1 and Digital UNIX), and the 32V kernel is only a little bigger than the 
original FreeDOS kernel I wrote.  The Caldera license is pretty much a BSD 
license, which could be considered an open source license.  This means I should 
be able to work on it without worrying about IP, although I'd still need 
management approval.

Should I undertake such an project, would there be enough interest to justify 
the effort?

Pat
