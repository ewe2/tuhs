Hi Lawrence,

RAND's re from 1974 had become Ned, for New Editor by 1977 when Ned's
author, Walt Bilofsky, later founder of The Software Toolworks, wrote
RAND report R2176.  https://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/R2176.html

        Over the past few years Ned, a text editor utilizing the full
    capabilities of the CRT display, has been under development and in
    use at The Rand Corporation...

        The Ned editor runs on the PDP-11 series of computers under
    the UNIX operating system.  It uses a CRT display to provide a
    two-dimensional window into a text file...  ...rectangular portions of
    text may be opened, deleted, and moved about...  The set of operations
    may be expanded by user-provided or system-provided text-processing
    programs...  The screen may be divided into several editing windows...

Chapter 3 has the history of IDA-CRD → Yale Editor ‘E’ → RAND
editor ‘re’ → Ned.
