Well, I don't know what to say.  After a LOT of research, extracting old 
archives, digging through a LOT of things, I can only come to the 
conclusion that what have been called "bag" files in the circles that 
I've traveled in are in fact the output of batcher, thus standard "#! 
rnews <length>" files.

I think part of my confusion was that I was working with using UUCP at 
the same time to transport files via sneaker net using something similar 
to batcher / rnews files.  I guess I conflated the two things.

I'm sorry for the confusion.

They might not have been a different format (like I thought) but there 
were most definitely referred to as "bag" files in the circles that I've 
traveled.

I have repeatedly found reference to them, around DNews, and being 
called "bag" files because of the ".bag" file extension that they had.

I haven't been able to find anything to indicate if the nickname came 
from the file extension or if the file extension came from the nickname.

chicken ("bag") <-> egg (.bag extension) ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Thank you all for your input.

I'm sorry for the confusion.
