I couldn't quite resist, so tried it out. Take this for what it is, an
anecdote.

Reading 10 GB in direct mode using dd with no skip at the beginning,
in 1 MiB blocks, gives me about 190 MB/s on one of the Seagate SAS
disks in my PC, and some 165 MB/s on one of the HGST SATA disks in the
same PC. Obviously, that's for purely sequential I/O, with very little
other I/O load.

Doing the same with an initial skip of 3,500,000 blocks (these are 4
TB drives, so this puts the read toward the outer limit), I get 105
MB/s on the Seagate SAS and 100 MB/s on the HGST SATA.

I did the same thing twice to make sure caching wasn't somehow
interfering with the values. The differences for all reported transfer
rates were marginal, and well within a reasonable margin of error.

That's definitely statistically significantly slower toward the outer
edge of the disk as presented by the OS. That _should_ translate to
slower for higher LBAs, but with all the magic happening in modern
systems, you might never know...

Of course, back in ye olden days, even 100 MB/s would have been
blazingly fast. Are we spoiled these days to think of throughputs on
the order of a gigabit per second as slow?
