You may think that; I may think that, we _all_ may think that.

But in the legal world, that, and $2 (or whatever the going rate is these

Unless someone is prepared to chivvy a rights-holder into actually _doing_
something, any talk is ... just that.

Any volunteers to make something actually happen?
