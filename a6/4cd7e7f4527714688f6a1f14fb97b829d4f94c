A couple of NeWS-related links which I saved back in March:

A book / conference report surveying the state of Window Management in
1985, specifically the chapter on an early version of NeWS:

http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/inf/literature/books/wm/p005.htm

The amazing NeFS, the Network Extensible File System, which was supposed
to be version 3 of NFS, based on in-kernel PostScript.

Thankfully it died :-)

http://www.donhopkins.com/home/nfs3_0.pdf

Last year, an appreciation of NeWS written from a modern perspective,
including some comparisons with the JS / HTML / CSS / SVG web:

Finally, a question: is there a good comparison of NeWS vs NeXT Display
Postscript anywhere?

Tony.
