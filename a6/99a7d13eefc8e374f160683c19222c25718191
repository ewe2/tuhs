My argument is that Go is making that an untenable exercise.  E.g., 
forcing environment variable overrides means I don't have a source tree I 
can check out *anywhere* and have it just build.  No different from the 
built-in assumptions the go command makes.

I get the feeling there won't be any sort of actual argument for or 
against the Go regime, so I won't.
