	Yep - I have seen that on the 11/93 at my place.  Nice.  Having the
	"toyclock" to get the date/time from is real good too.

	Use less power and are more reliable (also larger capacity I believe)

	As I was reminded a short time ago - don't put a Qbus board into a
	Unibus machine (or the other way around) :-)

	SL/IP yes but 2.11 predates PPP and I am not sure there is room in
	the kernel/networking for PPP (which is a much more complex protocol).

	I've run SL/IP just fine - and if you have the (fairly) recent updates
	to enable hardware flowcontrol you can run considerably faster than
	9600 and not worry about dropped characters or truncated packets.

	Ah, yes indeed!  As long as the kernel's idea of the drive size
	is less than what the actual disk image is then you should not have
	any problems - i.e. if you put an RA60 sized image on an RA92 it 
	should work (at least well enough to configure the 2nd drive correctly).
	Obviously the other way around would not work ;)

	A TK70 controller will run a TK50 drive very nicely _and_ offer
	the benefit of the buffer cache (which speeds things up greatly).  I
	do not know if there was a Unibus TK50 adaptor though.

	An inexpensive TS05 would be a real nice thing to have about now ;)

	Steve

As long as you've updated to the Y2K-compliant KDJ11-E firmware, that is.

The "old" firmware will do fine up until the end of 28-Feb-2000, when it
will promptly wrap back around to 1990.  You can use 2.11BSD 'toyset'
(or the RSX-11 or RT-11 equivalent) to set the TOY clock after that date,
but at power on it'll reset back to 1990.

See the discussions in vmsnet.pdp-11 earlier this year for the ordering
code and cost (I think it's around $25.00) for the new 11/93 and 11/94
firmware.
