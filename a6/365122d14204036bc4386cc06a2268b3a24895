And the real joke is that they haven't done any serious work so far as I can
tell.  The original SCO sucked and then they release SVr<something> but so
far as I know, there wasn't a decent development team.  When I was doing
the TCP/IP port I worked with Jeff Radik a bunch but I never got the sense
there were big projects at SCO, it was mostly out sourcing.  That was a 
long time ago so who knows.

All I know is that Sun did orders of magnitude more work to the kernel,
libraries, at the rest of user space.
