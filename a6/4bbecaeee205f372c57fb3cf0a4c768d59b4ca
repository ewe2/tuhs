They sure were...  We had a problem with our RK-11 when running Unix, and 
because it never showed up with RSX it must've been the fault of Unix, 
right?

Wrong...  The DEC gingerbeer turned up with something called "DECEX" (for 
DEC exerciser); it was menu-driven, and you could exercise as much of the 
system as you wanted (simultaneously).  Well, it found that overlapped 
seeks were not implemented properly on the RK-11 (which Unix used but RSX 
didn't, and neither did their standard diags).  One quick FCO later, and 
it was fixed; red faces on the part of DEC...
