I did not have a lot of time to work on documenting the evolution of =
paging / virtual memory code in 32V, Sys III and early SysV in the past =
months, but I did get some more background information that seems worth =
sharing.

My understanding of the virtual memory story at USG is now as follows:

Somewhere in 1981/82 a project plan for Unix 5 / System V was made and =
evolving John Reiser=E2=80=99s virtual memory code for 32V-r3 was part =
of that plan. =E2=80=9CEvolving=E2=80=9D in this context meant making it =
more maintainable and more hardware independent. John=E2=80=99s code =
assumed a memory page, a disk block and a file block all to be the same =
size, and it needed to be more general. It was also designed around the =
VAX MMU and this too needed to be generalised. The person assigned to =
that job was Bob (Robert) Baron, reporting to Tom Raleigh. The project =
involved quite a bit of re-architecting and progress was slowish. On top =
of that Bob left for CMU to work on Mach. Tom Raleigh tried to pick up =
where Bob had left off, but progress remained slowish.

In parallel, Keith Kelleman and Steve Burroff were working on Unix for =
the 3B20 Unix. They did paging code from scratch around the 3B20 MMU =
(which used a more or less =E2=80=98modern=E2=80=99 page table design) =
and developed their idea for the =E2=80=9Cregions=E2=80=9D abstraction =
to support large, non-contiguous address spaces. It seems that they =
built on the main working set ideas/concepts in the Reiser/Baron/Raleigh =
code base, combined these with their =E2=80=9Cregions=E2=80=9D idea, =
made it multi-processor capable and made it all work on the 3B20. Around =
that time Tom Raleigh seems to have transferred to Bellcore, and the VAX =
code base got orphaned.

Two young engineers appear to have picked up the work on the VAX code =
base: Dean Jagels and Jim McCormick. My understanding is that they =
essentially back ported the 3B20 work to the VAX, falling back on the =
Reiser/Baron/Raleigh work where necessary. They got it working, and as =
far as I can tell, this is what got released in 1984 as part of SysV =
R2.4 for the VAX (the oldest surviving source code for this that I could =
find).

This somewhat tortuous birth may in part explain why Research chose to =
use the 4BSD virtual memory code for 8th edition.
