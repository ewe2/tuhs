Hilarious!

The AUUG conferences seem pretty tame by comparison; one year, we used the 
menu holders as catapults (I don't know where we got the rubber bands) and 
dotted the ceiling with toothpicks (they were still there at a subsequent 
conference).  Or am I confusing that with a Caving conference?

At another (Warren will remember this one, as he was involved) we refaced 
a Pyramid poster (KNOW UNIX, THINK PYRAMID) to "NO UNIX IN PYRAMID", with 
the strategic application of napkins and some gaffer tape that we'd dug up 
from somewhere...  Gary Jackson took it well.

At an early one, when Gould first came out, we social-engineered their 
booth-marketoid into giving us root access; the buggers never did pay the 
bounty, claiming that we'd cheated.  Well, yeah...

At yet another, we had a Sun 3/50 window connected to a Convex, and acted 
all innocent when various dweebs did the old "echo 99k2vp..." etc trick.

Sigh; I miss the AUUG conferences.

Some people have no sense of humour.  Did anyone actually, err, avail 
themselves of this unique opportunity?
