:-)
And if you hadn't had the ability for them to be less than 8K, you 
wouldn't even try that argument. But just because the hardware gives you 
some extra capabilities, you suddenly want to associate them with a 
technology that really gives you much less capabilities.

Either way, the next page always start at the next 8K boundary.

Oh yes. You definitely could do demand paging based on the hardware 
capabilities.

Ah. Good point. The same is also true for brk, even though that is an 
explicit request to grow your memory space at the other side.

DEC OSes had the brk part as well, but stack was not automatically 
extended if needed. DEC liked to have the stack at the low end of 
address space, and have hardware that trapped if the stack grew below 
400 (octal).

Yeah, it would actually probably have been more useful on an 11/45.
