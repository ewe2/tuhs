Indeed they do.  I'd put RedHat as the best of the best, but truth be
told, Debian is not bad, it's more basic but it works.

I disagree about the BSDs being similar to Linux, go partition a
disk with FreeBSD and then compare that to Linux.  It's night and day.
The Linux stuff works and is obvious, the FreeBSD stuff only makes sense
if you have been using that forever, it's awful if you are a newbie.
And I say that as a guy who went through Sun's stuff, it was similar to
FreeBSD but a bit better.

Linux really did just make stuff work.  Is it elegant like v7 was, absolutely
not.  Does it handle a ton of stuff that nobody could imagine in the v7 days?
Absolutely yes.  Is it more complex than it should be?  I dunno, it is more
complex than I like but I'm an old graybeard.  I really wanted coarse graine
locking with what Clem and crew did with the cluster approach.  The vproc 
stuff.  I loved that and I think that is the knee of the curve, scale up
a bit on SMP but then cluster to scale up more.
