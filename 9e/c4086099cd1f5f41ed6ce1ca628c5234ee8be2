Yes. See:

  http://mercury.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/tech/jpg/ARPANet/L77Dec.jpg

and look at the MIT-44 IMP (upper right center). It's listed as having a
PDP-11, with the /v, and that machine (LL-ASG, 1/44) was definitely on a VDH
(it was not in Tech Sq). (A VDH was basically an IMP modem interface
hardware-wise, but made to look like a host at a high level within the IMP
software.)

Err, he may have gotten it from San Diego, but they didn't write the code, it
was written at UIll. See:

  http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=SRI-NOSC

which contains a copy of the code, which came to me via NOSC in SD.
