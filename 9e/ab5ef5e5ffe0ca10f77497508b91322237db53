Don't know about nodes, but the initial research on the arpanet was done 
at Lawrence Berkeley Lab.  The primary goal of the project
was for scientists to share data.  But, alas, the scientists didn't want 
to share data.  And, there were so many data formats that
nobody could read each other's anyway.  So we ranked the arpanet as a 
failure for that item.  However, we found that it seemed
to be incredibly useful for communications amongst people, i.e. email...
