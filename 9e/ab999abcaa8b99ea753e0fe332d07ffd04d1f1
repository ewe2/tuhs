I'm also skeptical about this claim, although it could depend on
what "initial research" means. I believe LBL did work on early TCP
implementations, the conversion from NCP to TCP, and the early "software
tools" movement. (I was there for a year in 1988 and had the office next
to Cliff Stoll when he was doing the Cookoo's Egg work, but that's
another story).
