Yeah there is certainly sun code... for example here's the copyright
bit in a file:

/*
 * xdr.c, Generic XDR routines implementation.
 *
 * Copyright (C) 1984, Sun Microsystems, Inc.
 *
 * These are the "generic" xdr routines used to serialize and de-serialize
 * most common data items.  See xdr.h for more info on the interface to
 * xdr.

One of the uni's I went to made that transition in the mid 90's.. At
that time I didn't realize how many 'upgrades' they had made to Ultrix
to make it... usable.  Although I don't think I miss archie/veronica
but the simplicity of pine/lynx is kind of there.. oh sure they still
run on 'modern' things but it isn't the same really.

It's funny the weird things that get left around the internet... and
the host file from that tape image is MASSIVE.. lol and I thought
having a DNS zone with that many enteries was crazy...  I did manage
to hack the networking for it to work... It's not elegant, but
commenting out the error checking in if_de's derecv procedure seems to
work... I could ping around for the last 5 hours, and telnet into it.
I'll have to build some package with simh to run it on windows...
