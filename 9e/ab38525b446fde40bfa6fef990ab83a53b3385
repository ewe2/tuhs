Slightly off-topic, but still UUCP related. If a SunOS box NFS exported 
/, and I could mount /, even without root NFS access, using the uucp 
user, I could overwrite uucico because it was owned by uucp. The entry 
in inetd.conf would automatically run uucico as root. Telnet to the box 
on that port, and it would happily run whatever I put in the uucico file.

Bad joo-joo.
