The root disks date from a time before Linux had shared libraries, I
thought, though I've not looked at HJ Lu's disks in a very, very long time.
And I stopped looking very early on once I had my system bootstrapped... I
do recall going through some pain to bootstrap shared libraries on my
system...

/sbin has never been for static binaries in BSD land. It's always for
system admin binaries that used to live in /etc. They moved to /sbin or
/usr/sbin. This split is due to historically tiny / filesystems and the
need to have just enough binaries on them to check and mount /usr later in
boot. It dates from 4.3-RENO. There were no shared libraries in BSD at the
time (though I think contemporaneous Sun systems had them, which is where
Linux got its first a.out shared library scheme from (kinda, sorta, more
inspired by with some code snatched from gcc/binutils SunOS compat impl,
but with more limitations)).

Early days this was actually quite common. You put your users under
/usr/foo because there weren't many of them, and you'd save a inode lookup
over /usr/users/foo and you didn't need a separate filesystem for your
users. I saw it more on 'small' systems with limited number of users rather
than big, university systems with student populations on them (which needed
a separate filesystem to hold all the user content, even with draconian
quota limits).
