Subject: [TUHS] Documentation on B language?
Message-ID: <20160307002052.GA24746@minnie.tuhs.org>

So the PDP-7 code from Norman has a B interpreter. I know the history:
BCPL -> B -> NB -> C, but I don't recall seeing a decent decription of
the B language. Does anybody know of such a document? We'll need something
like this so we can use the interpreter once we get it working :-)

Cheers, Warren
