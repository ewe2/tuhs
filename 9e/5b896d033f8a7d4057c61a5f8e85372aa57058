COS-310 was the OS for the EDUsystem 310. As far as I can remember, it 
is not based on OS/8. I think you are right that the EDUsystem predated 
the 8/A, but they are not that far apart.

If you are thinking about the 8/A built into a desk, that was not called 
a 310 anything. You could, of course, boot COS-310 on it, though. In 
fact, the 8/A in the desk would have been the DECstation 88, or 
something like that. I need to go and dig up my old DEC handbooks to 
verify that, though. But I was amused when the "DECstation" (MIPS based) 
came out, and remembered thinking that I've seen DECstations before. :-)

I know of Doug Jones FAQ. I probably contributed to it, and I was 
definitely around before it, or Doug, had heard of PDP-8s. :-)

All that said, my memory do sometimes play tricks on me, so if I'm 
wrong, and someone can point at a DEC document that says otherwise, I'll 
happily admit my error.
