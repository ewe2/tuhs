I=E2=80=99d love to hear more about that. So far, the only information I =
have found about (lowercase) streams and networking - as used at the =
labs - is the v8 source code and a 1984 message from dmr on a mailing =
list. The (lower level) v8 networking concepts appear to carry through =
to v10 and Plan9.

It is my impression that the unix/datakit tradition essentially views a =
network connection as a special kind of device, whereas the unix/arpanet =
tradition essentially views a network connection as a special kind of =
pipe. In both cases this would seem to have been an accidental choice =
driven by convenience in early implementations (respectively the Spider =
network drivers and NCP Unix from the UoI).

However, that is an impression formed 35+ years after the fact and the =
contemporary view may have been very different.
