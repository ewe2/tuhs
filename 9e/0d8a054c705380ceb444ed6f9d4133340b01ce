Incidentally, on modern systems with tcsh and csh, I use both chdir
and cd; the long form does the bare directory change, whereas the
short form is an alias that also updates the shell prompt string and
the terminal window title.

I also have a personal alias "xd" (eXchange Directory) that is short
for the tcsh & bash sequence "pushd !*; cd .", allowing easy jumping
back and forth between pairs of directories, with updating of prompts
and window titles.
