Are you sure it's reporting bytes, and not words?

There shouldn't be a big difference in speed. Are you starting some heavy
demons?

There exists a specific 11/73 CPU card, but we'll ignore that for now.
The 11/73, 11/83 and 11/84 all use the same CPU card.
The differences are in other areas, and cannot always easily be detected
by software.
The difference between an 11/73 and 11/83 is if the system have Qbus
memory or PMI memory. The difference between an 11/83 and 11/84 is if the
system have the KT84 (or whatever the card is called, my memory fails me
at the moment) Unibus map, which is a Q-bus to Unibus converter along with
the Unibus map required. The CPU is always on a Qbus, but in the 11/84,
nothing but CPU and PMI memory is on this bus.

No.
As stated above, the CPU card is actually always Qbus. In the 11/84 you
have a bus adapter to connect the Unibus.

Yes, since you probably don't want to pay a lot of money to Mentec for one
of their OSes. 2.11 is much nicer, but you'll want more memory and disk
space for that.
