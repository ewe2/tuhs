This is really great - thanks from me on this, also!

I missed all of this at CMU by several years.  By the time I got there, 
dvk was at the Software Engineering Institute (which is where I was, so 
that's how I met him), and as far as I am aware, the PDP-11's were 
mostly long gone, except for a few that were used as routers (I had an 
11/34a that we used as our router from the SEI building back to Wean Hall).

Sort of a bummer I missed out on a lot of the fun.  ;-)  I think the 
only thing interesting I did while I was there, Unix-wise, was getting 
the 4.3BSD DEQNA driver working with the DELQA - I gave those changes 
for a few people elsewhere that asked for them, but I can't even find 
them myself anymore....
