I have copies of the old 8086/8088 PC Xenix.  I don't know if SCO or
Microsoft even sold
the sources.  My old boss ran very early Microsoft SCO on a PDP11. 
Don't know if he had
sources.

Even working as a sysadmin for an AT&T oem of System V wouldn't get me
access to the source
through normal corporate means.  Perhaps I could've bribed an engineer
with a Pizza to let me get
to his machine without a screen lock... but he'd have been risking his job.
