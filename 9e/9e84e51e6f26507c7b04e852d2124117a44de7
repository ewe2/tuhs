	I don't think that's the problem in this case - the error that is
	being printed out:

	 cn 1 csr 176540 vector 344 no address found for kl/dl-11

	comes from what appears to be a missing entry (or an entry that
	autoconfig can't find) in the /unix kernel symbol table.   One way,
	I think, this can happen is when booting an alternate kernel (/genunix
	instead of /unix).

	THe only suggestion I have at this point is to turn on debugging
	in autoconfig.   To do this go into /sys/autoconfig/main.c and
	add a line that forces 'debug = 1;', then install (after saving the
	original ;)) autoconfig into /etc and reboot.   Hopefully useful
	info about what autoconfig is doing will be printed.

	If I find the time I'll power up the 11/73 and see what it says but
	I've had a DHV11 on the system for years (it's how I got the RTS/CTS
	flow control working).

	My suspicion is that the DHV clone isn't behaving 100% like a DEC
	DHV card.

	Doing a 'reboot' (which performs a sync(2) call) will overwrite
	what fsck has done - when the message about "reboot" comes out you
	should use the front panel or ODT to simply halt the cpu and then
	start the boot process cold.

	Cheers,
