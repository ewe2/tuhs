I'm tooling around doing my annual dive into operating systems ancient 
and not-so-ancient and I've gotten back around to v7 because it has a 
working f77 in baseline. The 3b2 has f77 as an installable package but 
it crashes and burns with read statements like: read *,var - in both 
sysvr2 and sysvr3. After consulting with the fortran expert, I'm gonna 
chalk it up to "man there's a lot of backstory to these seemingly simple 
issues" and just work with v7... in full disclosure f77 also seems to 
work fine on 211bsd, but that's too new for today's dive :).

Anyhow, I ran through my install notes from back in 2017 and did a few 
updates on them to update urls (would everyone just go ahead and move to 
https already?), fix some clunky examples, fix some typos, and update to 
a more recent host environment (although some would argue that Mojave is 
out of date - just give me a drop in replacement for Adobe Acrobat Pro X 
(a 32 bit app) that doesn't phone home every 5 minutes and I'll move to 
Monterey). Version 1.7 of the doc is posted on the blog: 
https://decuser.blogspot.com/

Anyway, now I'm ready to add stuff to my shiny new v7 instance and 
document the additions. So, on to the question of the hour... I did some 
looking around and couldn't easily locate any v7 software archives for 
additional software that will run on v7 (not the distros, which are 
adequately hosted in the Unix Archive). Stuff like pascal, fortran iv, 
fortran 90, basic, lisp and the ilk. Do y'all know of any good caches?

Later,

Will
