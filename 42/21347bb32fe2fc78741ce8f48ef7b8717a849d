It's perhaps worth noting that today's DNS is somewhat different from the
original; some fairly substantial changes were made early on (although maybe
it was just in the security, I don't quite recall).

(The details escape me at this point, but at one point I did a detailed study
of DNS, and DNS security, for writing the security architecture document for
the resolution system in LISP - the networking one, not the language.)
