All may not be lost.

As it appears to me, TUHS has connections with Universities / Colleges 
and other types schools, as well as programmers, software engineers and 
the like.

All we need to do is put the word out that TUHS is seeking pre-1991 AIX 
source code and it's bound to surface. If all else fails, I'm sure 
someone has a pre-1991 AIX binary distribution that could be 
disassembled (that is if a binary distribution can be disassembled back 
to a rough source code).


To all TUHS members,
     As a part of the heritage of Unix, please search any and all your 
archives for pre-1991 AIX Source Code. Maybe, just maybe, a pre-1991 AIX 
Binary Distribution will suffice. Help IBM,  TUHS, and in the end, the 
heritage of Unix.

    Thank you,
    James Falknor
