Subject: [TUHS] Novell, not SCO, found to own "Unix"
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.21.1803300721250.3361@aneurin.horsfall.org>

Time for another hand-grenade in the duck pond :-)  Or as we call it 
down-under, "stirring the possum".

On this day in 2010, it was found unanimously that Novell, not SCO, owned 
"Unix".  SCO appealed later, and it was dismissed "with prejudice"; SCO 
shares plummeted as a result.

As an aside, this was the first and only time that I was on IBM's side, 
and I still wonder whether M$ was bankrolling SCO in an effort to wipe 
Linux off the map; what sort of an idiot would take on IBM?
