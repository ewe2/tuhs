Yeah, some of the code is a bit non-obvious because the author of this snippet was trying to get the minimum number of instructions that
have to be keyed in with the front panel switches to make things go.

Yep, as far as the UNIBUS is concerned the bus addresses could be memory or control registers for some peripheral.

Your analysis is correct.  Note this one jumps to zero when ready as opposed to the tape boot you posted before which just loops forever
expecting you to notice the tape has finished moving and wants you to load 0 and start.
