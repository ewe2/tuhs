I think those two statements say everything.  Sun was not in a position to
negotiate and AT&T desperately wanted SVR4 to be the standard - I think it
was corporate pride. (which I also think was mixed up the BSDi/UCB case too
- if they had let it go it would have been a darned site smarter).

If AT&T could have swallowed and excepted somebody other than them having
the 'high order bit' it might have worked.  As you say, leveraged the
industry standard.  Instead is just added to the fighting.
