Subject: [TUHS] Quasijarus.Z problem
Message-ID: <200402282347.13723.wes.parish@paradise.net.nz>

I downloaded the two Quasijarus distros, and tried " tar zxvf *.tar.Z ", and 
nothing happened.

I was under the impression that gzip (both standalone and included in tar) 
knew how to handle compress files.  Apparently not.

My system's Mandrake 9.2, tar (GNU tar) 1.13.25.  Is there some incantation 
I'm not doing?  Any ideas?

Thanks.
