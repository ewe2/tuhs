Subject: [TUHS] Links to relevant Unix Usenet newgroups?
Message-ID: <20160124035628.GA27099@minnie.tuhs.org>

Hi all, does anybody know of on-line historical Usenet archives that
I can link to, especially if they have unpacked articles (visible
subject lines would be better)?

What newsgroups are relevant? net.v7bugs, comp.sources.unix,
comp.sources.misc, net.sources, mod.sources, comp.sources.bugs?
What about platform or system-specific newsgroups?

I'll put the links here: http://wiki.tuhs.org/doku.php?id=publications:newsgroups

Thanks, Warren

P.S A good history of the legal side of Unix is here:
