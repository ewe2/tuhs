Subject: [TUHS] Latest IOCCC Entry: PDP-7 and PDP-11 emulator
Message-ID: <20180513091902.GA15525@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, in case you haven't seen it:

This is a PDP-7 emulator in C, enough to run PDP-7 Unix. But the author
has written a PDP-11 emulator in PDP-7 assembly, and uses this to run
2.9BSD on the emulated PDP-7 :-)

Cheers, Warren
