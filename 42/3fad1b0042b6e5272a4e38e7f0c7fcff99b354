I always thought the domain names were backwards, but that's because I
wanted command completion to work on them. I have not reevaluated this
view, though, since the very early days of the internet and I suppose
completion would be less useful than I'd originally supposed because the
cost to get the list is high or administratively blocked (tell me all the
domains that start with, in my notation, "com.home" when I hit <tab> in a
fast, easy way).
