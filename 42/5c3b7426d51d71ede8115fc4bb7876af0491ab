Message-ID: <335aede9-7b7c-42e3-a22d-ef3918e92625@aueb.gr>

The Second Edition manual has a section titled "User Maintained 
Programs" listing the following utilities and games: basic, bc, bj, cal, 
chash, cre, das, dli, dpt, moo, ptx, tmg, and ttt.  In the Introduction, 
the reader is asked to consult their authors for more information.

Does anyone remember whether at the time these were installed in the 
system-wide /bin directory, or whether they were only available in their 
owners' home directories?
