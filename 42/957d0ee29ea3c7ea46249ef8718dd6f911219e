Hi,

Do you remember the broken chip on pdp11/34 ? 

well, i changed the HC74LS175P with an original SN74LS175N. Now
i can write and read correct data on memory :))) and the RED LED
"PARITY ERR" on the M7891 board turn OFF while pdp11 is running
a program. :)))

BUT

the pdp11 can't boot: the boot loader program stop after few
steps. 

some details will follow in the next days; now i can't make any
further test ...
