Interesting history. Carl Christensen was also one of about 4 people
who interviewed me for a job at Bell Labs during a snowstorm in
Summit and Murray Hill in early 1969. I did use the early Glance terminals
during my programming days at Bell Labs, but had nothing to do
with their design. Carl and I taught a group of Explorer Scouts on
Monday evenings at Murray Hill in the early 1970's. Jon was one
of those scouts that we taught UNIX and its programming languages.
And we introduced them (including Jon) to  spelunking! in the summer.
