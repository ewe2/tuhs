I noticed that oddity while staring at the printset. One thought (and  
a really ugly one at that) was to build a two chip replacement. Of  
course the pinouts of an inverter and a "normal" quad mux not being  
anything at all like the 8266 would really complicate matters. A last  
resort.... Also would the two chip sol'n change the timing through the  
AMUX - is it in a critical path?

No surprises here. It's just painstaking, delicate work that I have  
little experience with.

That makes sense but it's a trace to the F connector (FK2 I think) and  
the 8266 is at position E10? above the A connector...

Again no surprises. The broken trace is in an area densely packed with  
runs as all the signals from the component side feed through the  
module and are interleaved with the lines from the solder side, all  
feeding into an area filled with resistors and diodes.

I found the alleged location of W1 on the M7261 - it's not obvious  
what's a jumper and
what's necessary copper. back to the print set before wielding and  
Xacto.

Easy enough to disable the LTC on a DL11W.

I'd much prefer the DL11 choice to more board mods.
