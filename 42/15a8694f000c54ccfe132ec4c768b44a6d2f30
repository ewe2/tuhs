Subject: [TUHS] why does tar have the tape device hard coded into it and
 why is it mt1 instead of mt0

Yeah, I just can't imagine using tar with the f option.  Even back in 
the day when I was writing 9 track magtapes with tar, it would be 
something like
     tar cvfb /dev/rmt0 10 .
to get tape blocks bigger than 512 bytes.  But we never had dectapes and 
I think they did their own blocking.
