When I took Computer Architecture, "reasoning" about out-of-order execution=
 involved 30-page worksheets where we could track the state of the Tomasulo=
 algorithm through each iteration. It was ludicrously slow work, and wouldn=
't be a lot of fun even if you had a computerized tool to help step through=
 things instead.

If you're talking about a modern Intel CPU where your compiler emits CISC i=
nstructions which are actually implemented in RISC instructions in the micr=
ocode, which in turn get rewritten and reordered internally by the CPU... i=
t's hard to fault programmers for thinking at the level of the instruction =
set that's presented to them, even if it looks like a PDP-11.

The above should not be read as an endorsement of the CPU status quo, of co=
urse :)
