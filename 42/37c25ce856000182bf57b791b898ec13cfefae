> Not relevant to a sudden dip, but overall my observation is that retro computing interest tends to focus on a period 30-40 years ago. For example, in the late 80’s people were going retro on the LGP-30, the story of Mel, etc. Probably this matches with people retracing their formative years in the industry when they retire.

Speaking of early Linux, Slackware version 15 was released earlier this 
year, and I can happily say that it still feels the same way it always 
has. I don't think the installer has changed much since the early 90's.
