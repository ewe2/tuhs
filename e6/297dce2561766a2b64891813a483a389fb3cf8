Yes, as noted on this page: http://so-much-stuff.com/pdp8/C/C.php

You mean Xinu, perhaps? Minix was always an 80x86 and 680x0 system.

There is also xv6: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/xv6.html
with a small monolithic kernel. I've added a BSD library and runtime
to the kernel here: https://github.com/DoctorWkt/xv6-freebsd

Of course, you could always go retro and try Mini Unix :)

Cheers, Warren
