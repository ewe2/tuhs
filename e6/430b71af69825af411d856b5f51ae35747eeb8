The site where I got the v7 image was a bit short on instructions. It just had 
the RL image. I was stuck trying to read man pages from within the booted 
system. However, your message has prompted me to try to dig up the manual. I 
have found a set of 3 PDF files, and I have been poking around in them.

I was not expecting termcap or curses; I was... *hoping* (still not expecting) 
that perhaps v7 was new enough that the 'simple' type of CRT terminals, the 
ones that were basically just glass TTYs, were in common use. That it would 
be possible to use stty to set the number of rows to n, and that just maybe 
there would be a 'more' command that would only printout the next n lines. 
You know, simple stuff. Nothing about cursor addressable displays, no special 
codes for clearing the screen, or text attributes, just screen paging. At any 
rate, I may sit down at some point and write a 'more' utility of my own. Not 
that I need it for man pages now that I have the offline version of the 
manual, but there are still things like long directory listings that it would 
be useful for.
