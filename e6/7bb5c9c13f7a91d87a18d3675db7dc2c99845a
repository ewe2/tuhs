Packages go one further by including a single multi architecture binary.  Of course the only thing more fun than compiling something is to say compile it four times.  “-arch i386 -arch sparc -arch hppa -arch m68k” but now you had a binary that could run on all the NeXT platforms, instead of having 4 separate files.... 

Although I think today it’s largely x86_64 & ARM.  But I’m sure there is some holdouts with MIPS/PowerPC/S390/Sparc/Sparc64 etc.

Something like _snaps_, which Ubuntu is apparently pushing in their
most recent releases?

What is a snap? https://snapcraft.io/docs/snaps/intro

Can a vanilla Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Server run without snapd?
