Where does RFS (AT&T System III) fit in all of this?

I used it for a while between a SunOS 4.1.3 box and a PC running AT&T 
SVR4.2 (Consensys) because the client-side NFS was buggy on the SVR4.2 
side. This was in the days when I ran a UUCP node (kilowatt) in the 
early 90's and needed access from the PC to the "large" (5.25" FH 1GB) 
disk on the SunOS machine. It worked, that I can say.

Eventually, I swapped it around after getting an Adaptec SCSI controller 
for the PC - turned out the server-side NFS on this particular SVR4.2 
was fine.

Just looking for history on RFS if any.

thanks!
