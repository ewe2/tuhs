Hi

I am sure there must have been an email about this if so, I do apologies.

The below link is from Diomidis Spinellis work, I remember seeinng an email
from him a few months ago requesting some information about the history of
BSD. Looking at it, he has done some amazing work. I look forward to
playing with 386BSD!
