This might be true of gaming cards and low-end workstation cards, but   
the higher-end Quadro cards and all the dedicated GPGPUs have had at    
least ECC since at least the Maxwell era.  Of course, nobody does a     
single run and stamps the drawings, so the process itself should catch  
these problems, but any correctly-configured CAD workstation or compute
cluster has error-correcting memory, both on the system and in the
accelerators.  AMD's Radeon Pro and Intel's Xeon Phi accelerators do
ECC as well.
