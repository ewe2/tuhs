Heh!

But that does point out that the general concept is kind of confused - at
least, if you hope to get a fully working program out the far end. The only
way to do that is build (effectively) a simulator, one that _exactly_
re-creates the effects on the memory and registers of the original program.
Only instead of reading binary machine code, this one's going to read in the
machine language source, and produce a custom simulator, one that can run only
one program - the one fed into it.

Think of it as a 'simulator compiler'! :-)
