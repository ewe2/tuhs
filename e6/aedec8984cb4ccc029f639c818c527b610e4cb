Mary Ann Horton:

  I'm enjoying bwk's book very much, but it has me wondering. There are 
  two stories I've heard that supposedly occurred at Murray Hill, but he 
  didn't include them.

You can't expect every story to be there.  The book would be too
heavy to lift!

Could the `monkey picture on a badge' story be that of G. R. Emlin's
badge?  She was a gremlin doll, not a monkey, but it would be
reasonable to mistake the former for the latter.

Here's a good pictore of G R herself, with what I believe to be at
least a second-generation badge.  The original badge was an old-style
Bell Labs one with a green border; I forget whether that meant
contractor or something else, but a regular MTS badge was blue-bordered
at the time.
