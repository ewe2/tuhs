When I was at Berkeley working on my dissertation, I wrote a tool that 
would let you edit a text file written in any language you could define 
with a grammar, with syntax and semantic error checking while you 
edited.  I had grammars for several popular (in 1980) languages.  The 
only one I couldn't properly create a grammar for was C.

There were two problems:
1) typedef, which lets you create new words with syntax implications, 
and
2) the preprocessor, which lets you get into all kinds of syntax trouble
