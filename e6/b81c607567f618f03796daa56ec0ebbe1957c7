Subject: [TUHS] V7 on i386?
Message-ID: <40589.216.191.248.101.1062010401.squirrel@www.stormbird.org>

Hello,
I was looking through mailing list archives for any attempts of porting
UNIX V7 to i386. I saw a discussion of it at
http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2002-January/000071.html where Some
brave soul tries to port V6 to i386; Does anyone know whether or not
anything came out of it?
cheers,
Masoud
