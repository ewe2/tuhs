Conversely, at BOCES LIRICS in Dix Hills, NY, we had a field-service 
tech who seemed to know every single wire wrap in the PDP-10's. First 
the KA10 they had before I got there (but worked on in high school), and 
then the KS10's.

Maybe the VAX/PDP-11 crew were different :)

On the other hand, he left in his desk a complete list of KLINIK line 
phone numbers (modems connected in parallel with the CTY), and 
PASSWORDS, to just about every PDP-10 in the tri-state area (NY/NJ/CT).
