Wasn't extended memory on the -8 bank-switched via the IOT instruction?

It reminds me of what we did with AUSAM back at UNSW; the current buffer 
"b" (similar to "u") was mapped via KISA5 (?) into whatever was at 0150000 
(?), so you could have as many buffers as you wanted, limited by physical 
memory (I think).
