  Sounds like a fun box.

  Since I just went through this a few weeks ago, I'll mention that this won't
work because you won't ende up with the boot programmes aligned on block
boundaries.  The "maketape" command supposedly works well, and I made a tape
with it, but never did get around to trying to actually boot that tape.

  I don't know whether that would do anything useful, since AFAIK the boot
blocks assume tape.

  Whereabouts are you?  Someone can likely help.
