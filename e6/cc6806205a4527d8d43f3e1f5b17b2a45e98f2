I did so too in the early 1990s, using (IIRC) "XENIX System V", an
attempt to retrofit some System V features to XENIX.  It was very
limited: it ran in Intel 80386 real mode, so it was limited to 16 MB
of memory.  The toolchain was excruciating.  I think it was based on
Microsoft products, and I soon replaced them with GNU software, which
had its problems on the platform.  The good news: it worked.

You don't say your time.  Referring to Jeremy's original message (time
frame mid-1980s), no, Linus would have been about 14 at the time.  He
made the first announcement of what would become Linux on 25 August
1991 (=E2=80=9Cjust a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu").  So
yes, it was available when I was doing my XENIX work.  So was BSD/386,
which is what I was using at the time.
