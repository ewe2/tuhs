The 68K was fairly clean; the VAX not so much...  I got the impression
that it was designed by a committee i.e. everybody wanted to have their
own instruction/feature, and it showed.  I do admit though that paging the
page tables was a stroke of genius.

I used to be a whiz on the 360 :-)  As part of our final CompSci exams
we had to hand-assemble and disassemble some code, and I hardly ever referred
to the "green card".

The Z80 was quite nice; I wrote heaps of programs for it, and I even found 
an ANSI C Compiler for it (Hi-Tech as I recall; BDS-C was, well, you could 
barely call it "C")[*].  I compiled a number of Unix programs...

The x86 architecture is utterly brain-dead; I mean, what's wrong with a
linear address space?  I think it was JohnG who said "segment registers
are for worms".

I've been looking at the ARM; it seems quite nice at first glance.

Indeed.  I gave up on USENET when the joint got flooded by spammers; I 
still have my "cancel" script somewhere.

I think it was Henry Spencer who said (in an unrelated matter): "Somehow 
to be called a C compiler, I think it ought at least be able to compile 
C".
