> does anyone have some eqn input and output that they can share?

I have a quite elaborate document that uses eqn, pic, and tbl. In
fact one table contains both pic and eqn entries (but not subtables;
Latex beats roff in being recursive). Take a look at
www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/wallpaper.pdf. If you think you'd like
to see the source, just holler.

> he maybe should do Latex

Sadly, math journals often demand Latex, but I've also run into
journals that require Word. I wanted to submit the document above
to a cartography journal until I found out they were in the
Word camp. I was, however, able to convert it to Latex. 

At one point the American Instutute of Physics took only roff
(and retypeset other manuscripts--in roff). I don't know what
their practice is q
now.

No manuals, true. But if there had been they would have been
in some version of roff, just as all Research Unix manuals were.
