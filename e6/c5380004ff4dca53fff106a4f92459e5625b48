Bad luck. The CD's are lost (unreadable actually). Not surprising seeing as they
were old and had been tossed around so many times (sic).

Maybe the original request for Mach sources should be redirected to comp.os.mach
or to some of the original authors to see if they still keep something around. 
It might be that even CMU keeps something.
