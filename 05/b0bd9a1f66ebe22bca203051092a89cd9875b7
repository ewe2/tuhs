Although I'm not connected with the TeX community, I don't agree with much
of what you said.

1.  TeX source to C is fine - stable and works.  It would be impossible to
rewrite TeX in any other language without introducing bugs and
incompatibilities. Leaving TeX as-is means that it can be converted to
other languages too if/when C goes out of style.  TeX as-is is exactly what
it is.  Anything else wouldn't be TeX.

2.  Drop DVI?  Are you kidding me?  Although PDF may be popular now, that
may not be the case 20 years from now.  A device-independent format is what
is needed, and that's what DVI is.  TeX is guaranteed to produce the exact
same output 100 years from now.

3.  I am curious about memory limitations within TeX.

4.  Knuth is getting up in age.  Someone will have to take over.

I suppose #4 was my whole point about both TeX and troff.  They're both
great tools.  Perhaps people used them in the past because there weren't
many other solutions.  You had to learn them.  These days people prefer the
simpler tools such as Word, OpenOffice, etc.  Although they can't produce
the same quality, they can produce sufficient quality with a smaller
learning curve.  Don't get me wrong, I despise Word.  I just don't find my
feelings echoed very much.  Some things TeX and troff are going to need in
order to continue:

1.  Continue to be maintained

2.  An effort to make knowledge of them wider will have to occur if they
are to continue.

3.  A case for their benefit will have to be made and dispersed.
