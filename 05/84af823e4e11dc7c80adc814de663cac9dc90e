Good, glad to know it wasn't just me.  I've finally let my team use it
but we avoided it when we supported more odd ball platforms.

On zero fill, I doubt many did that.  Many really early on when memory
was small.

What you might be thinking of is modern systems implement malloc()
as an mmap of /dev/zero and the initial data comes through as zeroed.
But counting on that would be a mistake.
