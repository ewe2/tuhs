It seems that even then it was of variable size.  From G.R. Trimble,
"STRETCH," Computer Usage Communique, 1963,
(http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Computer_Usage_Company/cuc.communique_vol2no3.1963.102651922.pdf):

  the words can be composed of "bytes" with from one to eight bits in
  a byte.

There's more at https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/stretch.html.

Transient maybe, but UNIVAC used the term in its documentation of the
1100 series.  The 1106/1108/1110 could access (but not directly
address) 6, 9 and 12 bit "bytes".
