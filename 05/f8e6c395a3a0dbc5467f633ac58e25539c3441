A major topic on this list has been the preservation of computer
history, through museums that collect and operate old hardware,
software emulation of past hardware and software systems, and data
recovery from newly discovered, but previously thought to be lost,
archives.

I came across an article today about another major industry that has
been exceedingly careless about preserving its history:

        Wipe Out: When the BBC Kept Erasing Its Own History
        https://getpocket.com/explore/item/wipe-out-when-the-bbc-kept-erasing-its-own-history

It is a must-read for Dr Who fans on this list.
