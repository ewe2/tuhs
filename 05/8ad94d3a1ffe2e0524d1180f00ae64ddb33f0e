I received several recommendations for the Living Computers Museum, =
including some from folks on this list.  Based on this, I contacted =
Stephen Jones and am now working with him to tie down the details.  =
Thanks to all who responded; you guys rock!

Because no good deed goes unpunished, I may be asking some of you for =
autographs on things you wrote.  (I asked Stephen if this would be =
useful to them; no response as yet).  Also, if you have some detritus =
that you've been meaning to give away to a good home, this might be a =
good way to make it happen.  Let me know if you want to get involved...
