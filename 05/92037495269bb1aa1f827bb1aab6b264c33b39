Subject: [TUHS] Login names of early Unix contributors
Message-ID: <5120CD06.9040100@aueb.gr>

Does anyone have a record or pointer regarding the login names of the 
early Unix contributors?  A few (aho, dmr, bwk, doug) are listed in 
http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/, but many others seem to be missing.

In particular I'm interested in the login names of following people:

S. R. Bourne
D. Haight
S. C. Johnson
J. F. Maranzano
L. E. McMahon
S. I. Feldman
J. F. Ossanna
M. E. Lesk
R. H. Morris
D. A. Nowitz

I guess the /etc/passwd file from a Bell Labs system of the mid 1970s 
would be ideal, but even partial recollections would help me.
