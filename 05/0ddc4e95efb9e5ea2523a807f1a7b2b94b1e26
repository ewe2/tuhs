As a Sun guy it was obvious that NFS should win.  Sun ran all of
engineering on NFS, it actually worked and worked well.  When I left Sun
I found out that nobody did NFS anywhere as near as well as Sun did it.
At SGI NFS was a joke, we had senior engineers who said "don't trust
that, use rcp"  (looking at you Dave Olsen).  That was weird to me,
at Sun NFS just worked, as in you never thought about it not working.
Everywhere else it was so-so.
