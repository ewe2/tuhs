=46rom my perspective most of these things are not unique to networks, =
they happen with disks and/or terminals. Only out-of-order delivery =
seems new. However, in many early networking contexts =
(Spider/Arpanet/Datakit/UUCP) this aspect was not visible to the host =
(and the same holds for a single segment ethernet).

To me, in some ways networks are like tty=E2=80=99s (e.g. completing i/o =
can take arbitrarily long, doing a seek() does not make sense), in other =
ways they are like disks (raw devices are organised into byte streams, =
they have a name space). Uniquely, they have two end-points, only one of =
which is local (but pipes come close).

Conceptually, a file system does two things: (i) it organises raw blocks =
into multiple files; these are the i-nodes and (ii) it provides a name =
space; these are directories and the namei routine. A network stack =
certainly does the first: a raw network device is organised into =
multiple pipe-like connections; depending on the network, it optionally =
offers a naming service.

With the first aspect one could refer to any file by =E2=80=9Cmajor =
device number, minor device number, i-node number=E2=80=9D. This is not =
very different from referring to a network stream by =E2=80=9Cnetwork =
number, host number, port number=E2=80=9D in tcp/ip (and in fact this is =
what bind() and connect() in the sockets API do), or =E2=80=9Cswitch / =
host / channel=E2=80=9D in Datakit. For disks, Unix offers a clean way =
to organise the name spaces of multiple devices into a unified whole. =
How to do this with networks is not so easy, prior to the invention of =
the file system switch.

Early on (Arpanet Unix), it was tried to incorporate host names into a =
net directory by name (RFC 681) but this is not scalable. Another way =
would be to have a virtual directory and include only names for active =
connections. The simple way would be to use a text version of the =
numeric name as described above - but that is not much of an =
improvement. Better to have a network variant of namei that looks up =
symbolic names in a hosts file or in a network naming service. The =
latter does not look very performant on the hardware of 40 years ago, =
but it appears to have worked well on the Alto / PuPs network at Xerox =
PARC.

With the above one could do

open(=E2=80=9C/net/inet/org.tuhs.www:80=E2=80=9D, O_RDWR | O_STREAM)

to connect to the TUHS web server, and do

open(=E2=80=9C/net/inet/any:80=E2=80=9D, O_RDWR | O_STREAM | O_CREAT, =
0600)

to create a =E2=80=98listening=E2=80=99 (rendez-vous) socket.
