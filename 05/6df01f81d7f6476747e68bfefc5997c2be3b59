The "block copy in an editor" thing is something which has intrigued
me for years. poor old ed/ex/vi just couldn't do it, and for the life
of me, I could not understand why this was "deprecated" by the people
writing that family of editors. I seem to recall the various
lightweight emacs which proceeded GNU had it, in some cases, and GNU
had it. (Goslings emacs?)

It was pretty much "you could do this with awk or sed" or "I wrote a
SPITBAL program to do that" for most things. -As if columnar state, or
a region of a screen was not something it even made sense to pick up
into a buffer and put down somewhere else.

Later on I theorised that the internal edit sequence log structure
might make this quite hard to conceptualise and implement. But, I
think its also possible the editor authors in question just didn't see
a use value for this up-front.

I think anyone who used WordStar or a half-duplex terminal saw a
potential use for this almost immediately. And, the people using the
early newspaper edit terminals almost certainly had a use for it
because even at low-charcount they routinely seemed to work in
newspaper columns, and so a "story" was about columnar paragraph
structured data.

Similarly the 'repeat this sequence of commands' thing which emacs
had, as a "start keystroke" <do things> "end keystroke" and then @run
that thing. Yes you could @run VI buffers, but you had to program them
into a state, you couldn't tell the editor to "watch what you did, and
re-do it on successive lines"

I also suspect, that "do the thing you just did" and "block copy" were
a bit low: people who did these kind of things were not clever. Clever
people held the state of the lines in their head, and were mentally
writing the ed/ex/vi or Teco sequences to change the letters in a
line. Dumb people like me were thinking of editing as "cut the words
out with rounded -end scissors and ask mummy for the clag gluepaste"

Many fine hours were spent doing rote edits to fix post-formatted
NROFF and RUNOFF text by me. Dumb, but doable.

(runoff on the Dec-10 was good. I am glad I'd done it, it made the
transition to nroff far easier. I didn't realize it was a cross-port
from CTSS)
