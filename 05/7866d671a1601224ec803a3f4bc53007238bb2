No... EIS is not the same as EAE, though simh does include EIS in its  
11/40 configuration.

 From memory:

EAE is the "Extended Arithmetic Element" which provided multiply,  
divide and shift capabilities through registers in the I/O space.
See Dennis Ritchie's "Odd Comments and Strange Doings in Unix" the  
pertinent item is "A hardware story" at the the end of the document,  
cached here: <http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:Cp9qctiIuLcJ:www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/odd.html+dmr+eae&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=4&gl=us

EIS is the Extended Instruction Set, which on the pdp11/40 (and lsi11)  
went hand in hand with FIS, the Floating Instruction Set.

See a pdp11 processor handbook for all the details.
