ALS '99 was a fun conference. I didn't attend in 2000. I'm going to stick
my neck out just a little bit and say that my experience with him was quite
different. We talked a little about the differences between Linux and BSD,
both userland and kernel space, and the history of NetBSD, including an
unfortunate occurrence with Bill Jolitz at a different conference. Charles
was cordial with me.

That same day, I went to the cafeteria area when I got hungry, and I saw
what looked like two kids sitting around a laptop working intently on
something. I was curious, so I asked them what they were hacking on. It
turned out to be Miguel de Icaza, now a Distinguished Engineer at
Microsoft, and Nat Friedman, who I believe is now CTO of GitHub (also owned
by Microsoft). They sort of blew me off, but to be fair, they were working
on a presentation they were about to deliver.
