The emacs manual *printed, one-sided, bound to the desk with rods of
steel* which I read in the 1980s in leeds was one of the best
explanations of Virtual Memory I saw. I really struggled with the idea
of address segments, maps, the idea of address space being bigger than
physical memory (I think I drove a PhD student doing tutoring close to
tears on this in '79) but the Emacs manual said really clearly
up-front: "look, you can't address 32 bits of memory in "me" I only do
24, but this is how I do them, if you're interested"

The Vax VMS manual along side it (another 2 feet of single-sided
print) was probably as good, but more aimed at real engineers who
could think in RPN and had pocket protectors.

This was in a context where it was probably the go-to basis to try and
play with LISP because nobody really told you about any other REPL to
run in. I think even then I realised I wasn't going to ever want to
code a towers-of-hanoi, nor even really explore 24 bits of (virtual)
address space.

I hate the cult. I decided to re-learn the finger muscle memory, now I
can do bare-minimum in emacs for ORG and I think I'll go back to vi
where I belong. vi suffered from insufficient love. I had to stop
hating vim when it became the only real choice. (hate.. culty word,
that) VScode was interesting, as was Atom, and I suspect more than a
few people who code for a way of life here think this editor-wars
stuff is tedious.

I actually "think" in ed. I can't escape line-based semantic intent. I
carry my own personal koan which basically says "any algorithm which
needs more than 2 sentences or 1 screen of code to implement is
probably beyond you". Its a bit of a flaw.
