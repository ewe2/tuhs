Hi, sorry if this is off topic, but... have anyone ordered/tested
the Free versions of SCO OpenServer and/or UnixWare?  Are them interesting
enough? (I'm currently playing with both Linux and FreeBSD, and
since we are talking about the UNIX PDP source license from a lot
of time, i wish to know if these Free UNIX versions contain some
interesting/useful UNIX source code...)

Regards,
	Sandro

Hi all,
	We've had a number of new subscribers to the PDP-11 UNIX mailing
list, so I'd like to welcome them to the list, and say that questions about
these old systems (and the hardware) are always welcome here, so fire away!

I mailed Dion Johnson at SCO again re the license issue, with no reply.
I tried some other SCO contacts, and got this back from Peter Laytham:

	Unfortunately this is always a busy time for SCO folk - September is
	our end of financial year, which means October and November are given
	over to planning and regional kick-off events including training
	(which Dion gets involved in).

	If you can bear with us, we are both submitting your case to the
	powers that be within SCO. However SCO has a fair bit of other work
	to cope with keeping the evil empire at bay and rolling out some
	significant new technologies (SVr5, Tarantella and two clustering
	products - reliantHA and Non-stop for UnixWare) which is slowing down
	non critical decisions such as this one.

	Cheers
		Peter

So it looks like we're in for some more waiting.

Sorry for the lack of change in status,

	Warren

Hi,

I was wondering if you could answer a simple (or maybe not, I'm not all
that sure) question about PDP machines for me. I managed to get a
PDP-11/04, I believe, but it had no console with it. All it has on the
back is a RS232-looking plug with some unknown to me pinout. Would you be
so kind as to give me some information or pointers how to hook up any sort
of an input/output device to it?

-Thank You.
Nickolai Zeldovich.

All,
	I've just received some email from Dion Johnson at SCO re the PDP-11
UNIX source licenses. Apparently he's been away from work (holidays?). He
says:

	I have a new cut of the proposed license
	from our NJ Legal folks.  I compare with past versions
	and see what it has.  I know the 32V was added to the
	list of licensed versions (good).  Not sure if the
	other problems were fixed.  I will get back
	to you before the holiday weekend coming.

As always, I'll let you know things as I receive them.

	Warren

Dear Warren,

	I was hoping you might be able to help me regarding some PDP 11 discs
which we have here, and wish to extract data from.

	The discs are labelled:

2315 Disc cartridge
12 Sector
DRI Part number 592

	We have a number of these discs containg data which we would like to
have converted into a format which can easily be read by a PC (ASCII, or
whatever.) 

	However, as you can tell by my e mail address, I'm in the UK and I was
wondering if you knew of anyone/ any group in Britain who could help me
with this task. If you do, I would be very grateful if you forwarded this
message on to them.

Eric, I don't think this is going to work. The RK05 driver is in the
kernel, and it plays with the RK05 hardware registers. You aren't going
to be able to emulate these, as far as I can tell.

If you tell us where you live, perhaps someone on the list might be
able to help you find an appropriate drive and disks for your 11/23+.

I do have some old ('74) spec sheets for the RK05 drives.

Does anybody else have other suggestions???

Best wishes,

	Warren

Eric, I'll put you on the PUPS mailing list so you'll get any replies from
the other members. I'll try and scan in the RK05 docs and put them up via
ftp for you.

Yes, I hadn't thought of that. Other places are the Lions commentary,

Ok, it would be nice to have a way of installing Unix onto a PDP-11 without a
tape drive. Here's a proposal: please comment on it (i.e shoot it down!). I
actually wrote a very similar system to move files off my Apple ][ once.


The PDP-11 is connected serially to another computer, using a DL11 port. The
other computer will simulate one or more disk drives which are acessible by
commands sent over the serial line.

The idea is that a person can hand-enter the boot code to retrieve the
`boot block' from the simulated disk drive. From there, the bootstrap
can retrieve the Unix kernel, which can then use the simulated drive as
the root filesystem. The user can then log in, use mkfs to build a filesystem
on a real disk drive, and install a suitable Unix kernel without requiring a
tape drive.

The protocol used must be simple enough that bootstraps can be entered
manually - at least to get the boot block from the second computer.


Minimalist Protocol
-------------------

4-byte commands are sent from the PDP-11 to the other computer. The
command structure is:

	Byte 0:	What command to perform
	Byte 1: On which remote drive to perform the command
	Byte 2: Low-order bits of block number
	Byte 3: High-order bits of block number

Blocks are 512 bytes. The commands allow access to 65,536 blocks (32Megs)
on 256 virtual disk drives. Of course, an alternate view could be 65,536
on 256 platters, giving 8G of disk space.

Commands are:	0x00		NOP		Do nothing
		0x01		READ		Read specified block
		0x02		WRITE		Write specified block

NOP:	The second computer does nothing in response. However, this can be
	used to determine if the PDP-11 is actually sending commands.

READ:	The second computer returns 512 bytes which contains the requested
	block. There is no checksum, framing bytes or block# details.

WRITE:	The PDP-11 sends 512 bytes which contains the requested block.
	There is no checksum, framing bytes or block# details. The second
	computer does nothing in response.

Drawbacks: Line noise is gonna really cause havoc. Only one command can be
	pending, as the PDP-11 has no idea what block is what when it comes
	back from the second computer.

Advantages: Should be easy to write bootstrap and /usr/mdec software, and a
	kernel-level device driver should be very easy. Altering v5, v6, v7
	2.9BSD and 2.11BSD should be straight-forward.

Do we need a more sophisticated protocol with checksums, multiple outstanding
commands, acknowledgments, framing bytes etc.?

Cheers all,

	Warren

Does the DL11 port have an interrupt that is driven when data is
received, or do processes have to constantly poll it to receive data?

Is the information stored on a PDP-11 disk in 8 or 9 bit words?  How
many bits per word are transmitted/received by the DL11?

This shouldn't be a problem.  Thinking from a 2.11 point of view, if
something that could load the standalone kernel was written and an
additional deveice driver included that would talk over the serial line
once the standalone stuff was up you could treat the PC, or whatever, as
a tape drive.  Whilst this doesn't give all the frills of full disc
access it has a couple of good thigs to it:

1)  The only stuff that has to be loaded over the serial line without
the benefit of lots of code that can do error checking is the initial
standalone loader.

2)  The standalone loader can then treat the serial port as a tape drive
which is a relatively simple process as far as the loader is concerned
and so you would only need a driver that looked like a TS11 (say) but
talked to a serial port.

3)  The PC end would then just have a simple prog that would treat the
files on the PC as tape files which would make shipping stuff around
easy as we could then do this as dump or tar forms which could be just
ftp'd etc from archives.

It would be slow but it would get things going quite simply.

Ideas + comments please?

Yes or you can poll.

Disks are 8bit (2 8bit, 1 word = 16bits) and the DL can be set to send 
7 or 8 bits and with or with out parity.

It may be difficult to find a Q-bus RK05 controller. RL01/RL02 drives
and controllers are a lot more common, and bigger, so might be a better 
choice. You might have to switch to v6 Unix to get the RL support though.

Your proposal sounds very similar to the existing protocol (RSP) used
to access remote block-addressable devices (TU58's) over a DL11 port.
Why not just choose the RSP protocol?  It has the advantages of already
being defined and it already has support in most DEC OS's.  It could
be easily extended to support larger devices.  And RSP-servers
already exist for BSD-ish systems - see, for example,

I was thinking of simulating a disk, as then we could manipulate the
disk image using an emulator on the PC end, and still use it on the PDP-11
end. I've made some changes to the suggestions I emailed, and if I get some
time just after Xmas, I'll try to get something working under v6. Then I
can port it up to v7 and 2BSD.

Given how close v6 and v6 were, backporting the RL driver to v5 shouldn't
present too many problems. I hope :-)

How complex is the tu58 protocol? I wanted something that we could
hand-toggle the boot code, if necessary. I'll pull that file and have a look.

Many (most) Q-bus processors have TU58 bootstraps in firmware.
Certainly all 11/73B, 11/83, 11/93, 11/84, and 11/94 have the
bootstraps.

Later Unibus processors (11/24, 11/44) often had TU58 bootstrap
PROMs to boot diagnostics from TU58.

The TU58 drivers aren't as simple as RK05 drivers (is anything as
simple as a RK05 driver?) but they are comparable with, say, 
RL01/02 and RX02 drivers.

One thing we don't want people doing is thinking that the TU58
protocol can be used as a poor man's system disk.  Yes, it is
flexible enough to be used as such, but it would be cruel to
allow anyone to do that to themselves :-)

Are you sure, Tim?  My 11/73 doesn't, and according to my microPDP-11
Maintenance Manual, only the 11/23+ and microPDP-11/23 have TU58 -- the only
tape devices listed for 11/73 and 11/83 are TK25 and TK50 (my manual is too
old to include 11/53 and 11/93).

Is this a KDJ11A (dual-height, no boot ROMs on the CPU board) or
a KDJ11B (quad-height, boot ROMs on the CPU board)?  If you 
have a KDJ11A, then your boot ROM resides in a MXV11, a BDV11, or
elsewhere (possibly a third-party controller) in your system.  (You'll
notice that I said "11/73B" in my above message, because the
KDJ11A has no boot ROMs at all...)

My KDJ11B has the following built in bootstraps (listed through
"Setup" in the boot menu or with a "Boot" followed by a "?"):

 DU     0-255   CPU ROM  RDnn, RXnn, RC25, RAnn
 DL     0-3     CPU ROM  RL01, RL02
 DX     0-1     CPU ROM  RX01
 DY     0-1     CPU ROM  RX02
 DD     0-1     CPU ROM  TU58
 DK     0-7     CPU ROM  RK05
 MU     0-255   CPU ROM  TK50, TU81
 MS     0-3     CPU ROM  TK25, TS05
 XH     0-1     CPU ROM  DECNET ETHERNET
 NU     0-15    CPU ROM  DECNET DUV11
 NE     0-15    CPU ROM  DECNET DLV11-E
 NF     0-15    CPU ROM  DECNET DLV11-F
 
If your KDJ11B doesn't allow you to see the above list, then
the boot menu has been disabled and it has been set to only
auto-boot.  I can tell you how to reconfigure to get at the
boot menu.

Part of the confusion may lie in the fact that TU58's appear to the system
to be disk (block-addressable) instead of tape devices :-).  The downside,
of course, is that it's a disk with a 30-second seek time!

I certainly don't want anyone to think that I'm extolling the TU58 as a
perfect wonderful device.  There are lots of reasons to *not* use them.  My
point was mainly that the RSP (radial serial protocol) used to speak to
them is well-defined and already exists; there's no use in re-inventing
the wheel.

Well, my KDJ11 systems are somewhat non-standard, so it's possibly not
relevant. I can't easily check ATM, as they're running live Unix systems :-)
 My point
was that I didn't think the TU58 was in all revisions of the bootstrap ROMs.

I know how to get the information (from a variety of revisions and CPUs)
because I not only have the documentation, I used to be employed as a
maintenance 'engineer' on QBus systems.

Indeed, but we both know that DD means tape :-)

But still better than some systems.  (Fond memories of TU56's on a PDP8, and
not-so-fond memories of friends' Commodore disks, which seemed slower even
than that).

And as Tim points out, RSP is well-defined, tried, and tested.

OK, then, I *think* the most complete official summary of hardware bootstraps is
Micronote #15, something that every Q-bus maintenance engineer ought to
have readily available...  If our esteemed list-owner will allow me to post an

        (1)     The information in the BDV11 column refers to the Rev A
                chips.  There were also Rev O chips and an additional TU58
                chip that can be added to the board:

                Rev O:

                        Part numbers 23-010E2, 23-011E2

                        Does NOT support:
                                DLV11-F, RX02 as bootable devices


                TU58 ROM:

                        Part number 23-126F3

                        Inserted into socket XE40.  Other ROM must be
                        Rev A.  Allows use of the TU58 DECtape II as
                        a bootable device.


*end excerpt*

It looks to me like the only devices with more complete than TU58
hardware bootstrap support in the Q-bus world are RX01 and RX02...  and
RX02 is already supported for the standalone utilities in
BSD2.11, thanks to the efforts of someone who will here go nameless :-)

Ummm....  I'd just like to point out here that if I was intending to put

Freak show?  Actually, an emulator on a PC would be more of a freak show!
I have come to the conclusion that PCs are freaks - REAL computers come in
racks!  The bigger the better, unless I can't store it...

Well, personally I think it's the *realness* of the thing that sells
tickets to freak shows.  You can paint all the pictures of two headed
babies you want, but the guy who has a living one in a jar is the one who
draws the crowd.  8^)

I'm not going to argue for PC's.  My roommate & I have about 20 of them
lying around and we've been working furiously lately to consolidate them
into one big rackmounted, networked Linux system.  In fact one of the
projects that's been slowly moving toward the front of my mind is to
modify the forking and piping system in Linux so that the OS can
dynamically allocate networked motherboards when it needs to run new
tasks...  Like if you run two tasks from the console it will run one on
the local machine and pick a remote machine on the network to run the next
one, then pipe the output from both of them back to the console so they
both appear to have been run on the local machine.  It wouldn't increase
the "BogoMips" but it would be nice for graphics rendering,
inexpensive multiuser systems, or anything else that needs or can use
multiple processes.  But I digress.  Yes, PC's are built like a psychotic
dog-mansion, but unless someone offered me a PDP-11 with a 64-bit data bus
that was made with modern chip manufacturing techniques and had a decent
user interface & peripherals, I'd still choose a PC over a PDP-11.

Well, if you just want a minimal system that can play simple games
through the console port, you don't need any of the Unices.  RT-11
is perfectly servicable and will boot from floppy or TU58 quite nicely; it's
even possible to have a working TCP/IP implementation on a 11/03
this way.

The 32bit version is called a vax!  I'll take a vax over a PC anyday.
Come to mention it I have 6 Vaxen and 4 operating qbus pdp-11s.

Who wouldn't?  (As long as I could put Unix on it instead of VMS, of
course.)

Maybe real Unix but I've deleted ultrix in favor of VMS!  Maybe NetBSD 
will sort out some of the problems.

Hi all,

	Last year I mentioned the idea of installing PDP-11 UNIX over a
serial line, for those people who have real PDP-11s but no tape drives.

I've written the code to do this over the past few days, and its time to
pass it to someone who actually has a PDP-11 and no tape drive! The code
is of course alpha-quality, but I'm using a PC running John Wilson's Ersatz
to install 7th Edition on a simulated RK05 right now.

I need someone who has a:

	+ PDP-11 which _will_ run 7th Edition
	+ Spare RK05, RP03, RP04, RP05 or RP06 disk
	+ A DL/KL-11 serial port at vector 0176500 (i.e 2nd unit)
	+ An RS-232 null modem with hardware handshaking lines
	+ A machine running a 32-bit Unix to host the other end of the
	  serial connection
	+ Spare time, and a tendency for masochism :-)

Someone who also has a PDP-11 running v7, and a source license would
be a bonus, as they might be able to help with the debugging.

I'm at the point where I can bring in the `boot' file (record 0) off the
simulated UNIX install tape, load and run cat, mkfs, icheck and restor.

I get some error messages with restor (``Missing address (header) block''),
which I believe are to do with the 10,240 byte record requests from restor.
My code expects 512-byte requests, and I'm doing 20 a time to fulfill the
10,240 request, but still problems.

Once the code is solid, I'd like to add other disks (RL02s etc.), and write
a user-mode program to read from the tape once UNIX has booted off disk.
This will allow other tape formats (e.g tar) to be read in.

If anybody would be willing to participate in getting this stuff to work
well, could they e-mail me next week?!

Thanks in advance,

	Warren	wkt at cs.adfa.oz.au

Try slowing down.  You may be overflowing the input buffer.  This was
a common problem on TU58s hooked to the 2nd DL on some systems at speeds
above either 4800 or 9600.  It only happend in the TU58 to host direction
(read) as the opposite path expected a handshake every 128 bytes(to allow 
the tu58 to actually do the write to tape).  It seems the tu58 would send 
a 512byte block as 4 128byte packets at a sustained rate fast enough to 
overrun the PDP-11 host input buffer; before it could be emptied.  You 
may be emulating a similar problem.  PCs do not service interrupts all 
that fast and OS overhead can make that longer.

Note PDP-11s can have enough overhead and higher priority stuff ahead of 
the 2nd DL that it cannot take data at greater than 4800 baud (sustained 
rate) without some kind of handshake to allow processing in between.
If the system is basically unloaded like my minimal 11/23 it can run at 
38.4!  The most likely time when this overrun can happen is while doing 
processing to write (via file system) to disk and recieving data at the 
same time.

I found the problem - my dump image was corrupt :-). I now have a clean
v7 dump of /, and there are no complaints from restor.

I've had a few people volunteer to try out the code. I'll clean it up,
finish off the docs, and put it up for ftp in a few days, with an email
on the PUPS mailing list on how to retrieve it.

Cheers,
	Warren

Hi -

	I thought I'd chime in with my experience with "high" speed serial
	transfers...

	The TU58's lack of flow control (unless you were on the Vax-750 with
	something I believed was called the MRSP roms) made them all but
	useless except in a 'standalone' environment.  As a boot device they
	were just "slower than molasses in January".  As a data storage device
	to be used while the system was up and doing other stuff the TU58 was
	quite poor.

	I tried to use the TU58 on an 11/44 once and it just wouldn't work
	reliably when trying to transfer a file from TU58 to disk.  The first
	time the system had to tape a couple milliseconds to write a block to
	disk you had a DL11 overrun and the transfer was corrupt.

	The DL-11 to which the TU58 was attached (could it be hooked up to
	something a bit better?  I would think so but don't know for sure)
	had no buffering/silo - at 9600 there was only 1 millisecond to get

	machine, especially if other things are going on at the same time.

	Ummm, 'PC's I'm used to don't seem terribly upset at 10 or 20 thousand
	interrupts per second - that should be sufficient to handle any 9600
	baud serial line I'd think.

	Not 'overhead' as much as just 'slowness'.  An 11/44 is about .6 mips
	(an 11/73 is about 15% less) - that's quite a bit less than even a
	286.

	The biggest problem I ran into was the fact that the disk systems
	all used SPL-5 while the serial ports (DL11,etc) were at 4.  A disk
	interrupt would (and did) come in and would delay things just enough
	that the DL running at 9600 with no flow control would overrun.

The tu58 also knows MRSP but the host still has to buffer a 128(plus 
wrapper) packet in one blast.  It's assumption is that the host has 
plenty of ram and a suitable buffer should be no problem at most data 
rates.  Call it a design error.  It's also something that has to be dealt 
with in all cases of serial communication.

As boot device, I used to take the average 750 console tape and rearrange 
it and on average cut the load time by 60% or more.  Seeks are slow being
30 seconds end to end.  The fewer the better also the ordder of files can 
make a difference.

I use it to boot a PDT11/130 and also an 11/23 in a BA11va (four slot 
box). and it's accept able IF the files are in the best order for access.

I have some data and the problem was on the 11/44 console side.  It could

they can only because the '450 has a silo of 4 bytes and the 550 it's 
either 16 or 32 bytes.  That's a whole lot of time before you must 
service it and then there is the matter of a few dozen mips of cpu behind 
it.

<(an 11/73 is about 15% less) - that's quite a bit less than even a

No comparison.  My 11/23 runs just fine with the TU58 running at 38.4k.
the difference is the 11/23 is not using a console processor inbetween.
In that case the DLV11j is the higest priority in the bus.

My 11/73 also uses the TU58 at 38.4 but the disks (RX02, RQDX3, RL02)
are all lower priority.  Again there is no problem unless the system is 
real busy and then the tu58 will do rereads for blocks that were not 
ack'd.

You don't need a lot of mips to recieve data at 9600 and put it in a 
buffer for later use.  Coding a routine to do it reliably is sometimes 
not as easy as it may look.  Also coding in HLL (even C) can add overhead 
not anticipated and slows execution. the problem in most PDP-11s is the 
serial buffer in ram is rarely 140 bytes (data plus wrapper) so that 1mS
you have then includes the whole file system and that takes a lot of mips
to keep up with.

<The biggest problem I ran into was the fact that the disk systems
<all used SPL-5 while the serial ports (DL11,etc) were at 4.  A disk

That would do it.  Try using a DH or DZ interface as they have a silo
and can sustain higher rates.

Its byte timing.  the bits are handled at the uart.  But your right 
my systems are lightly loaded and generally run RT11FB or XM.

The serial TU58 however does not have hardware flow control though it can 
be hacked on to the board. (hint inhibit the TX empty interrupt to the 
8085.) FYI the PDT11/130 got around this by using a parallel interface 
tu58.  The parallel interfaced tu58 cannot send a byte until the receiving 
system take the last one.

At one time to prove a point I did do a hacked up tu58 with hardware 
flow control and a matching DLV card and ran it at 38.4, the performance 
was impressive even under heavy RSX11 loading.  DEC did not do this as it 
would be a major redesign/requal of the product.  They did know the 
problem well however.

The key is look at interupt latency.  PDP-11s are OK but when you add
something like burst mode DMA where the CPU can be off the buss 
effectively for significant periods of time there can be performance 
hits.

Sure.  UNIX drivers have never been particularly optimized for high
async interrupt performance.

The 16540 has only one byte buffer.

The 16550 has 4 bytes, and the 16650 has (I think) 16 bytes.

That's more to the point.  Don't forget that a high-end Pentium is
probably 1000 times the speed of an 11/20.  I regularly get 50-60k
interrupts per second when downloading fonts to my PostScript printer,
and I think the printer is the limiting factor there.

Have you modified the kernel?  Normally disks will preempt ttys.

This is RT-11 and RSTS and I don't have a UNIX on the q-buss -11s.
I could recompile RT but, Qbus, interrupt priority is based on position

support, so you should be now able to install over a serial line to:

RP04, RP05 and RP06 disks.
RP03 disks.
RK05 disks.
RL01 and RL02 disks.

Other disk support would require hacking the V7 kernel sources.

I've back-ported uncompress to V7, and written a user-mode program to
read from the tape, so I'm hoping that once the basic root filesystem is
installed, you will be able to do:

	$ vtget /dev/tty1 5 | uncompress | tar vxf -

and pull over compressed tar images. That should speed things up.

I will consolidate the documentation, give it a damn good testing with
Ersatz 2.0 tomorrow, and then put the whole thing up for ftp at:

	ftp://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/PDP-11/Vtserver

I haven't heard from many of those who were `dying' for something like this
last year. Hopefully someone will find it useful :-)

Cheers,
	Warren

All,
	Ok, the alpha-cut of the virtual tape drive for installing 7th
Edition UNIX onto PDP-11s is available at

	ftp://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/pub/PDP-11/Vtserver

It works for RK05s, but I'm getting a `panic: iinit' error for RL02s.
This indicates a bad kernel build for the RL02s, something I have to work on.
I cannot test the software for RP03/04/05/06 disks, but this should be
vanilla V7 and should work with no problems.

A couple of people emailed me and said that they would rather get 2.11BSD
(again on a PDP-11 with no tape drive). Steven, would you be prepared to
add support for the virtual tape drive into 2.11BSD? Only the boot/install
code would need to change.

Would anyone with RL02s & experience with V7 kernels help me fix the
RL02 problems?!!

Cheers all,

	Warren

Hi PDP lovers!

My name is Lars Persson and I live in the south of Sweden.

I am collecting various flavors of PDP11 systems. Mainly Q-bus based ones.
Currently I have one system up running UNIX, namely an 11/23 with IDRIS.
IDRIS is roughly V6-ish, btw.
I also have in my collection a PDP11/73 with BSD 2.11 but this system is
currently suffereing from a defective boot sector on its RD54 and my TK25
has burned to cinders.. Can anybody help?

Other more or less workable systems are: 11/34, 11/03, 11/23s-/23PLUS, 
11/53, PRO-350, VT103 (the VT100 with a built in Qbus for LSI PDPs)
and also several VAXen (uVAX II, 11/730 and various VAX-stations).

In my collection I also have much litterature, manuals and engineering
drawings of PDP11s, spares, RL02 diskpacks, RK05 diskpacks, RX01/02 
floppies and much more. Happy to help anybody who needs it.

I have been fiddling with PDP11 computers for a considerable number
of years and I have also worked with UNIX and networking for a long long 
time. =)

Regards!

For those who were after RL02 support in the PDP-11 virtual tape server, it
now works. Thanks also to John Holden for space-optimising the 1st stage
boot code -- much less to hand-toggle in now.

I wanted to express my gratitude to PUPS, and especially PUPS member Bob
Armstrong, who transferred a copy of Seventh Edition UNIX onto an RL02
pack which worked immediately on my PDP-11/23+ ! :)

Below is a copy of booting instructions that Bob provided for the 11/23+. 
These worked exactly as billed.

If anyone needs some spare RL02 incandescent bulbs, I have a few on hand. 
Also, they are still availabe from Digikey at http://www.digikey.com. The 
part is a "CM 73" bulb, which is a T1 3/4 14V wedge base type.

Best wishes,

Bob Lash

Here are the instructions for booting System 7, just in case I forget
to tell you tomorrow:

  1) Be sure your terminal is set to 7 bits, even parity.

  2) Mount the pack, spin it up and hardware boot.  The unix boot program
will print an "@" almost immediately.  [This is really annoying, because
the 11/23 ODT also prompts with "@", so unless you expect this you'll think
that the machine has crashed!]

  3) Type "unix" and RETURN.  This is the kernel name, and when you are able
to build your own kernels you can type a different name.  If you make
any typos you'll have to reboot.  The boot pretends that you can try again
if you make a mistake, but don't believe it!

  3) Unix will say "mem = ..." and then "SINGLE USER LOGIN:".  Enter ^Z (not
^D!) to start time sharing.

  4) It will prompt for the date and time.  Note that the date doesn't give
you the opportunity to enter a year - the system will think it's 1997 until
you figure out how to change this (you didn't know that there'd be homework,
did you :-)

  5) You'll get a "login:" prompt.  The password to root is "pdp".

  6) You're on your own.  Have fun!

  Two more tips: if you aren't sure your hardware works, I recommend you
try your first boot with the pack write locked.  Unix will panic right
after it says "mem=..." with a write locked swap, but at least this way
you won't risk corrupting your pack until you're reasonably sure the
hardware works.

  Don't ever shut down the system without doing a couple of syncs first.
This is unix, after all, and you'll eventually trash your file system if
you shut down without syncing.

Bob

Glad to hear that PUPS is of some help. There isn't really any official
membership, though. If anybody joins the mailing list or signs the `I want
a src license' petition, then I count 'em as members :-)

On the source license front, Dion at SCO is still trying to push the legal
section into producing something. I mailed him last week but haven't heard
anything back. I've asked to establish some form of dialogue with the
nay-sayers, to try & address their concerns about a personal src license.

All this for a 20-year old piece of software!

This list tends to be quiet. What did you all get up to over Christmas,
and how are your PDP-11s going?! Did anybody ever get that tape from
George Colouris in England and read its contents?

Cheers all,
	Warren

Thanks for tweaking the list!
Holidays were great in the DC area (USA).  Weather was NICE.
Only problem is the weather has been so nice I have been working on
my cars instead of my 11s.
The 63 ford blew the heater coil/heat exchanger. mumble grumble.
The 67 buick is doing great - til yesterday on the way home from a 
little run.  Brakes are acting up.  Rain prevents getting at that in
the driveway.

With the rain, I have been playing with NetBSD on the vax!!
waiting for Linux!!
thanks!

G'day All...

In my possesion is a Digital Professional 350 machine.

I'm undecided as to try to find a ethernet card for it and use it in my own local
network (it needs a thicknet ethernet card - don't know where to find one for it,
and I'll also need a thicknet to thinnet converter).

Alternatively, I think maybe somebody else may be able to put it to better use (in
which case, I'll happily give it to you if you pick it up - I don't know about the
terminal and printer for it though).  (FYI I'm located in Sydney).

I've been planning to get unix 6 for it for ages, but hasn't eventuated yet.

Anyone who can help, please let me know.

Michael,

You can get Venix (~V7/System III) for the Pro on the Internet at
ftp://ftp.update.uu.se/pub/professional/venix/

The README file there has instructions on how to get it all booted.
You need a PC that can write 1.2MB, 5.25in floppies.  There isn't any
networking support.

Hardware wise, you need the Pro equivalent of the PDP-11 DEQNA
and a transceiver.  ftp.update.uu.se also has all the DEC P/OS
software, which can do DECNET.

G'day All...

In my possesion is a Digital Professional 350 machine.

I'm undecided as to try to find a ethernet card for it and use it in my own local
network (it needs a thicknet ethernet card - don't know where to find one for it,
and I'll also need a thicknet to thinnet converter).

Alternatively, I think maybe somebody else may be able to put it to better use (in
which case, I'll happily give it to you if you pick it up - I don't know about the
terminal and printer for it though).  (FYI I'm located in Sydney).

I've been planning to get unix 6 for it for ages, but hasn't eventuated yet.

Anyone who can help, please let me know.

Hi gang!

Would it be possible to generate RL02's from an ULTRIX uVAX with dd?
Like, we have bootable systems for the emulator on file.
Now suppose I recompile one of my ULTRIXen to recognize RL02 and
then transfer that emulator UNIX filesystem file to it.
Using dd I should be able to put the system on an RL02.
Would that RL02 be bootable in a PDP11 system or do I need to
put on some sort of boot information on a secret sector of the disk
to make it bootable?
IF it is bootable, is it legal to do it?
If it is legal, is it legal to distribute that RL02 to a third party?
IF it is possible AND legal I might be able to manufacture some RL02 UNIXen 
for you out there who got a PDP11 system but lack something to run on it.
Provided you pay the expense for shipping, of course. =)
I got a glassfibre box that can take two RL02 packs and this could perhaps
be used to ship things in...

Comments anyone?

I'm not a hardware guy, but I can't see any difficulties in doing this.
The RL02 disk images have everything (incl. boot blocks) to get UNIX going.

> IF it is bootable, is it legal to do it?

ONLY if the disk contains binaries ONLY. See the disk images that
Bob Supnik distributes with his emulator, and the SCO copyright notice at:

	http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/PUPS/Licenses/v7_bin_license.txt

Hopefully lots of people will take you up on this, Lars!!

All,
	I've just received the next draft of the proposed PDP-11 UNIX Source
License from SCO. To me it looks good, and I'd be happy to sign it. I have
passed a copy over to Steven Schultz: his 2.11BSD work is a derivative which
could be affected by the license clauses.

I'll try to get permission to release the draft to this mailing list from SCO.
I've asked them how long it will take before licenses go on sale, once we've
agreed with the draft license terms.

More news as soon as I have it....

	Warren

Hi again gang!

It looks as if we can turn the binaries in PUPS's archive into hardware
with dd, as my theory went.
So I went forth and started to tinker a bit with my trusty old ULTRIX rig.
I run into some problems though and before starting to fiddle with them
myself, I thought I should ask out there if this is a known caveat.

Here goes:
My uVAX has an RQDX-3 controller, a controller for EAGLE disks, TQK50,
DQNA and some sort of line card (A DHV-11 I think).
I added an RLV-controller for those RL02 drives into the system and
snipped some rows from the GENERIC file to make a good system.
What struck me as if upon my head was that the CSR for the DQNA and the
RL02 controller was the same.
Vector is set by some intricate mechanism automagically though.

Oh well, I maked the kernel and it booted fine. If found the hl device
BUT! It also said (twice!) that the hl device did not interrupt.

I do not have a drive connected though.
I tried both with and without external terminator on the drive connector.
No go. Same message.

I am reluctant to put cards on non standard CSRs since the GENERIC kernel
will not operate as intended and boy are those GENERIC kernels good to have!

So here is the problem:
What the heck is happening? Do I need to have the RL02 connected to get the
darn thing to interrupt or do I have a CSR / Interrupt conflict along the 
line?
Or could the controller be bad? (Not to worry! I got more controllers
laying about! =) ).

If nobody got answers to this my next experiment will be to take out the
DQNA and see if that helps. I am reluctant to fiddle to much with the
cards since the machine is installed in a non standard 19" CRAMMED FULL
kinda rack and is hard to service.

/Lars

likely yes, the drive must be connected.  Also recheck you haven't 
interrupted the bus grant sequence with the mix of quad wide and dual
wide cards.

<laying about! =) ).

It is possible.

Actually, if you use an expansion BA23 it is possible to hook a
RLV11 set to a uVax.  Woe to the person that tries this, though, as there
are bad things in store when the system begins doing any Q-bus
transactions past the lower 248 Kbytes!  The 18-bit-ness of the
RLV11 is a very nasty form of 18-bit-ness, and not easily overcome
like, say, the RXV21.

Certainly yes, if the Ultrix autoconfigure logic is anything like
2.11 BSD's was before I got fed up with it insisting that I have
my RL units #0 when booting.  To quote from 2.11BSD Patch #380:

Subject: RL driver update, setvbuf(3) arrives in 2BSD, rdist fix (#380)

Description:
	1) 'autoconfig' only recognizes the RL controller if drive 0
	   is connected to the system at boot time.

Repeat-by:
	1) Boot a system with multiple RL drives, but with drive
	   0 not present.  'autoconfig' will not see an interrupt
	   from the RL subsystem during its probe of drive 0, and as
	   a result the rl driver will not be attached.

Fix:
	1) Modify /sys/autoconfig/rlauto.c so it tests only for the
	   presence of the RL controller CSR, and doesn't wait for
	   an interrupt.  This is the same thing which is done in the TS11
	   probe routine because TS controllers can not be made to interrupt
	   reliably if a tape is not at the load point and the drive is not 
	   online.

Tim.

I.  DEFINITIONS

1.1 AUTHORIZED COUNTRY means one or more countries specified on
page 1 of this Agreement.

1.2 CPU means a computer having one or more processing units and
a single global memory space.

1.3 COMPUTER PROGRAM means any instruction or instructions for
controlling the operation of a CPU.

1.4 DERIVED BINARY PRODUCT means COMPUTER PROGRAMS in OBJECT CODE
format based on a SOURCE CODE PRODUCT.

1.5 DESIGNATED CPU means all CPUs licensed as such for a specific
SOURCE CODE PRODUCT.

1.6 OBJECT CODE means a COMPUTER PROGRAM in binary form,
resulting from the compilation of SOURCE CODE by computer or
compiler into machine executable code and which is in a form of
computer programs not convenient to human understanding of the
program logic, but which is appropriate for execution or
interpretation by computer.

1.7 SOURCE CODE means COMPUTER PROGRAMS written in certain
programming languages in electronic media form and in a form
convenient for reading and review by a trained individual, such
as a printed or written listing of programs, containing specific
algorithms, instructions, plans, routines and the like, for
controlling the operation of a computer system, but which is not
in a form that would be suitable for execution directly on
computer hardware.

1.8 SOURCE CODE PRODUCT means a SCO software offering, primarily
in SOURCE CODE form.  Such offering may also include OBJECT CODE
components.

1.9 SUCCESSOR OPERATING SYSTEM means a SCO software offering that
is (i) specifically designed for a 16-Bit computer, or (ii) the
32V version, and (ii) specifically excludes UNIX System V and
successor operating systems.

2.  GRANT OF RIGHTS

2.1 (a) SCO grants to LICENSEE a personal, nontransferable and
nonexclusive right to use, in the AUTHORIZED COUNTRY, each SOURCE
CODE PRODUCT identified in Section 3 of this Agreement, solely
for personal use (as restricted in Section 2.1(b)) and solely on
or in conjunction with DESIGNATED CPUs, and/or Networks of
CPUs, licensed by LICENSEE through this SPECIAL SOFTWARE LICENSE
AGREEMENT for such SOURCE CODE PRODUCT.  Such right to use
includes the right to modify such SOURCE CODE PRODUCT and to
prepare DERIVED BINARY PRODUCT based on such SOURCE CODE PRODUCT,
provided that any such modification or DERIVED BINARY PRODUCT
that contains any part of a SOURCE CODE PRODUCT subject to this
Agreement is treated hereunder the same as such SOURCE CODE
PRODUCT.  SCO claims no ownership interest in any portion of such
a modification or DERIVED BINARY PRODUCT that is not part of a
SOURCE CODE PRODUCT.

(b) Personal use is limited to noncommercial uses.  Any such use
made in connection with the development of enhancements or
modifications to SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS is permitted only if (i)
neither the results of such use nor any enhancement or
modification so developed is intended primarily for the benefit
of a third party and (ii) any copy of any such result,
enhancement or modification, furnished by LICENSEE to a third
party holder of an equivalent Software License with SCO where
permitted by Section 8.4(b) below, is furnished for no more than
the cost of reproduction and shipping.  Any such copy that
includes any portion of a SOURCE CODE PRODUCT shall be subject to
the provisions of such Section 8.4.

(c) LICENSEE may produce printed and on-line copies of
documentation included with the SOURCE CODE PRODUCT as necessary
for use with the DESIGNATED CPUs.  All copies must include a
legally sufficient copyright notice and a statement that the
documents include a portion or all of SCO's copyrighted
documentation, which is being reproduced with permission.

(d) Commercial use by LICENSEE of SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS or of any
result, enhancement or modification associated with the use of
SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS under this Agreement is not permitted.  Such
commercial use is permissible only pursuant to the terms of an
appropriate commercial software agreement between SCO or a
corporate affiliate thereof and LICENSEE.  For purposes of this
Agreement, commercial use includes, but is not limited to,
furnishing copies to third parties in a manner not permitted by
Section 8.4(b).

(e) SCO also grants LICENSEE a personal, nontransferable and
nonexclusive right to make copies of DERIVED BINARY PRODUCTS and,
subject to U.  S.  Government export requirements and to Section
8.4(b), to furnish such copies directly to other LICENSEES who
have an equivalent Software License with SCO before or at the
time of furnishing each copy of a DERIVED BINARY PRODUCT.

2.2 (a) Any notice acknowledging a contribution of a third party
appearing in a SOURCE CODE PRODUCT shall be included in
corresponding portions of DERIVED BINARY PRODUCTS made by
LICENSEE.

(b) Each portion of a DERIVED BINARY PRODUCT shall include an
appropriate copyright notice.  Such copyright notice may be the
copyright notice or notices appearing in or on the corresponding
portions of the SOURCE CODE PRODUCT on which such DERIVED BINARY
PRODUCT is based or, if copyrightable changes are made in
developing such DERIVED BINARY PRODUCT, a copyright notice
identifying the owner of such changes.

2.3 No right is granted hereunder to use any trademark of SCO (or
a corporate affiliate thereof).  However, LICENSEE must state in
packaging, labeling or other wise that a DERIVED BINARY PRODUCT
is derived from SCO's software under license from SCO and
identify such software (including any trademark, provided the
proprietor of the trademark is appropriately identified).
LICENSEE agrees not to use a name or trademark for a DERIVED
BINARY PRODUCT that is confusingly similar to a name or trademark
used by SCO (or a corporate affiliate thereof).

2.4 A single back-up CPU may be used as a substitute for the
DESIGNATED CPU without notice to SCO during any time when such
DESIGNATED CPU is inoperative because it is malfunctioning or
undergoing repair, maintenance or other modification.

3.  LICENSED SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS

The SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS to which SCO grants rights under this
Agreement are restricted to the following UNIX Operating Systems,
including SUCCESSOR OPERATING SYSTEMs, that operate on the 16-Bit
PDP-11 CPU and early versions of the 32-Bit UNIX Operating System
with specific exclusion of UNIX System V and successor operating
systems:

16-Bit	UNIX Editions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 
32-bit  32V

4.  DELIVERY

SCO makes no guarantees or commitments that any SOURCE CODE
PRODUCT is available from SCO.  If available, SCO will, within a
reasonable time after SCO receives the fee specified in this
Agreement for a SOURCE CODE PRODUCT, furnish to LICENSEE one (1)
copy of such SOURCE CODE PRODUCT.

consent of SCO, export, directly or indirectly, SOURCE CODE
PRODUCTS covered by this Agreement to any country outside of the
AUTHORIZED COUNTRY.

5.2 LICENSEE hereby assures SCO that it does not intend to and
will not knowingly, without the prior written consent, if

Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C.  20230, transmit,
directly or indirectly:

(i) any SOURCE CODE PRODUCT subject to this Agreement; or

(ii) any immediate product (including processes) produced
directly by the use of any such SOURCE CODE PRODUCT;

to Afghanistan, the People's Republic of China or any Group Q, S,
W, Y or Z country specified in Supplement No.  1 to Section 370
of the Export Administration Regulations issued by the U.S.
Department of Commerce.

5.3 LICENSEE agrees that its obligations under Sections 5.1 and
5.2 shall survive and continue after any termination of rights
under this Agreement.

6.  FEES AND TAXES

penalty), however designated, imposed as a result of the
existence or operation of this Agreement, including, but not
limited to, any tax which LICENSEE is required to withhold or
deduct from payment to SCO, except (i) any tax imposed upon SCO
(or a corporate affiliate thereof) in the jurisdiction in which
the aforesaid office of LICENSEE is located if such tax is
allowable as a credit against United States income taxes of SCO
(or such an affiliate) and (ii) any income tax imposed upon SCO
(or such an affiliate) by the United States or any governmental
entity within the United States proper (the fifty (50) states and
the District of Columbia).  To assist in obtaining the credit
identified in (i) of this Section 5.05, LICENSEE shall furnish
SCO with such evidence as may be required by United States taxing
authorities to establish that any such tax has been paid.  The
Fee specified in Section 6.1 above do not include taxes.  If SCO
is required to collect a tax to be paid by LICENSEE, LICENSEE
shall pay such tax to SCO on demand.

7.  TERM

7.1 This Agreement shall become effective on and as of the date
of acceptance by SCO.  The initial term of this Agreement shall
be for one (1) year.  Thereafter, the Agreement will
automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms unless
either party gives the other, no later than ninety (90) days
before the end of the initial term, or then current extension,
written notice of its intent to terminate this Agreement.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require either
party to extend this Agreement beyond the initial term or any
subsequent term.

7.2 LICENSEE may terminate its rights under this Agreement by
written notice to SCO certifying that LICENSEE has discontinued
use of and returned or destroyed, at SCO's option, all copies of
SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS subject to this Agreement.

7.3 If LICENSEE fails to fulfill one or more of its obligations
under this Agreement, SCO may, upon its election and in addition
to any other remedies it might have, at any time terminate all
the rights granted by it hereunder by not less than two (2)
months' written notice to LICENSEE specifying any such breach,
unless within the period of such notice all breaches specified
therein shall have been remedied; upon such termination LICENSEE
shall immediately discontinue use of and return or destroy, at
SCO's option, all copies of SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS in its
possession.

7.4 In the event of termination of LICENSEE's rights under
Sections 7.2 or 7.3, (i) all fees that LICENSEE has become
obligated to pay shall become immediately due and payable and
(ii) SCO shall have no obligation to refund any amounts paid to
it hereunder.

8.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

8.1 This Agreement shall prevail notwithstanding any conflicting
terms or legends which may appear in a SOURCE CODE PRODUCT.

8.2 If, and only if, SCO is the entity that provides SOURCE CODE
PRODUCT to LICENSEE, SCO warrants for a period of ninety (90)
days from furnishing a SOURCE CODE PRODUCT to LICENSEE hereunder,
that any magnetic medium on which portions of a SOURCE CODE
PRODUCT are furnished will be free under normal use from defects
in materials, workmanship or recording.  If such a defect appears
within such warranty period LICENSEE may return the defective
medium for replacement without charge.  Replacement is LICENSEE's
sole remedy with respect to such a defect.  SCO also warrants
that it is empowered to grant the rights granted herein.  SCO and
other developers make no other representations or warranties,
expressly or impliedly.  By way of example but not of limitation,
SCO and other developers make no representations or warranties of
merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose, or that
the use of any SOURCE CODE PRODUCT will not infringe any patent,
copyright or trademark.  SCO and other developers shall not be
held to any liability with respect to any claim by LICENSEE, or a
third party on account of, or arising from, the use of any SOURCE
CODE PRODUCT.

8.3 Neither the execution of this Agreement nor anything in any
SOURCE CODE PRODUCT shall be construed as an obligation upon SCO
or any other developer to furnish any person, including LICENSEE,
any assistance of any kind whatsoever, or any information or
documentation.

8.4 (a) LICENSEE agrees that it shall hold all parts of the
SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS subject to this Agreement in confidence for
SCO.  LICENSEE further agrees that should it make such disclosure
of any or all of such SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS (including methods or
concepts utilized therein) to anyone to whom such disclosure is
necessary to the use for which rights are granted hereunder,
LICENSEE shall appropriately notify each such person to whom any
such disclosure is made that such disclosure is made in
confidence and shall be kept in confidence and have each such
person sign a confidentiality agreement containing restrictions
on disclosure substantially similar to those set forth herein.

If LICENSEE should become aware of a violation of SCO's
intellectual property and/or proprietary rights, LICENSEE shall
promptly notify SCO and cooperate with SCO in such enforcement.

If information relating to a SOURCE CODE PRODUCT subject to this
Agreement at any time becomes available without restriction to
the general public by acts not attributable to LICENSEE,
LICENSEE's obligations under this section shall not apply to such
information after such time.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.4(a), LICENSEE
may make available copies of a SOURCE CODE PRODUCT, either in
modified or unmodified form, to third parties in the AUTHORIZED
COUNTRY having Source Code Licenses of the same scope herewith
from SCO for the same SOURCE CODE PRODUCT, if and only if (i)
LICENSEE first requests verification the status of the recipient
by contacting SCO at the address contained in Section 8.8(b) or
other number specified by SCO, and (ii) SCO gives written
verification of the recipient's software license status.
LICENSEE shall maintain a record of each such SOURCE CODE PRODUCT
made available.

to this Agreement has been reviewed and that each such SOURCE
CODE PRODUCT is being used solely on the DESIGNATED CPU (or
temporarily on a back-up CPU) for such SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS in
full compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.

(b) SCO shall have the right, upon reasonable notice to LICENSEE
and through SCO's accredited auditing representative, to make an
on-site inspection during normal business hours, not more
frequently than annually, of all LICENSEE's CPUs to determine
that SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS are being used solely on the DESIGNATED
CPU and are used solely for personal purposes as authorized under
this Agreement.

and continue after any termination of rights under this
Agreement.

I'm told by Dion that you nominate the CPUs on which the software will
be run. I have no idea how to nominate an emunated CPU. The one-off
fee covers ALL nominated versions AND all successor versions
(e.g the right to use PWB, AUSAM, 2BSD, System III etc.)

The licensee also specifies which are the authorised countries.
I hope/assume that I can specify my list of authorised countries as:

	All countries except Afghanistan, the People's Republic of China
	or any Group Q, S, W, Y or Z country specified in Supplement No. 1
	to Section 370 of the Export Administration Regulations issued by
	the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Hope this helps,

	Warren

I expect that the cost will initially cover NO media. From what Dion
is saying, SCO doesn't even have copies of these systems! I will suggest
to them that, if we can put together a CD-ROM image, perhaps they can
distribute the image with every license.

If not, the license allows us to exchange copies of the systems, provided
we get written authorisation from SCO. The licensing people there are
going to get awfully sick of me asking for written authorisation, otherwise.

Looking at that license from SCO, we should be able to legally use System III.
Does anybody have a copy I can add to the archive?

How many CDs are we looking at?  Maybe I can arrange something.

Maybe you should point that out and change that to "notification".

Dear All,

	I'm just looking at my proposed CD image for PDP-11 systems, and
there's an empty directory called Applications, which can hold applications
written specifically for PDP-11 UNIX systems.

I haven't got anything to put in there! No, I do have a very old Usenix
tape from Jay Jaeger, dated Sept 1977.

Does anybody have anything that might go in here for v6, v7, 2BSD, PWB.
Alternatively, does anybody know where full archives of comp.sources.unix
are on the 'net??

If there's space, I'd like to have some things like this on the CD.

Ta,
	Warren

I've just installed a 2.11BSD, and I'm having some funny problems.                                                      
Here's one; I'll make a separate message of the other.

I've added a new user with vipw.  When I try to change the password, I
get this:

Changing password for grog.
New password:
Retype new password:                                                  
passwd: mkpasswd failed; password unchanged.

If I run mkpasswd against /etc/master.passwd, it works fine.  But that
way I can't change my password.
  
Any ideas?

I find this distressing as putting up unix an my 11/73 is dependent on
availability of all the correct parts being available(drivers et al).

While I believe thre are versions that can be put on the machine I do 
not know enough to speculate how or what device requirements there would 
be.  What comes to mind, can it be configured to exploit the hardware?  
Or maybe the question should be is there a copy complete enough that has
all of the installion templates?

Definately should be written notification for manageability at their end.

I remember seeing this on the mailing list a while ago and wondered what
became of the Sys III (no that it's of any use to me with an 11/34!).
Hope you track down a copy....  I'm still looking for the pre AT&T V5
versions myself ... someone seems to have had a very early version here in
Cambridge UK but I can find out what became of it.  There may have even
been a PDP-7 running unix at one point here.  The CL are hopelessly
disorganised about such stuff -- it goes in the `old junk' category and
unfortunately they love to wipe tapes just in case they contain
proprietary software.  However I now have access to a half inch drive on a
sun (certainly 1600 & 6250 BPI, possibly more useful lower BPI also).  If
anyone in the UK has such tapes I'm most willing to try and read them.

No, what the legal guys have done is take the original v7 license and
alter it enough to keep us happy. This is why there are such hangovers
as designated CPUs. They probably did this to:

	+ minimise the work they had to do, and
	+ prevent a product being licensed under widely different systems

If they created a completely new license, there may be a legal slant:
e.g hey I own an original Western Electric v7 license, and now SCO's 
selling licenses which allow export of code to China (for example).
That's unfair, because my license prevents that. Sue, sue!!

[Maybe I'm just being paranoid here].

Anyway, the CPU restriction is BOGUS. SCO already have a binary license
for v5, v6 and v7 which allows you to run these systems on an UNLIMITED
number of CPUs. I can't see how they are going to enforce the CPU
restriction in the new license.

I think Dion suggested that auditing was probably not going to happen.
Mind you, don't hold him to that!

So it looks like we're going to be cutting our own media. At least the SCO
license allows us to charge for copying and distribution :-)

Don't say I didn't tell you.

I wonder if it's worth doing CD-ROMs for a few hundred people.
Initially you might sell 200, but then the rest would come over a
period of time, during which there would be updates.  In addition, the
CD-ROM format isn't ideal for everybody: many would like it on tape.
I'd suggest that somebody cut WORMs for those who want it on CD-ROM,
and tapes for those who want it on tape.  I can offer a variety of
tape formats, including (soon, hopefully) whatever a TS05 can write
(what's that?  1600bpi?), but not WORMs.

Greg

I'd like to see:

	+ a number of volunteers who are prepared to cut CD-ROMs
	+ a number of volunteers who are prepared to cut tapes
	+ a number of volunteers who are prepared to build kernels

in several countries (Australia, U.K, USA, Europe). Each can keep a
reserve of distribution media as they wish. I'm hoping the CD-ROM
image won't change more than once a year.

As you saw, Dion would send us details of new license owners, probably
via PGP-signed email. I'd like to pass the info on PGP-signed, so I'd
need the volunteers to have PGP too.

If we have a FAQ, we can list the people to ask for tapes, CD-ROMs etc.
You are allowed to charge for copying and distribution.

We're going to have to work on this in the next few months.

Thanks for all your suggestions & volunteering!

	Warren

I can volunteer for this.  The formats are: QIC-150, DDS, Exabyte 8500
(8200 if people can tell me how to do it on an 8500), and open reel
1600 bpi.

Europe and UK separately, eh?

Looking at the number of patches to 2.11BSD alone, I'd say that that's
a lost hope.  There have been three in the past two months alone.
That's one of the reasons I don't think CD-ROM is the way to go.  WORM
wouldn't have this deficiency if they were cut on demand.

One thing in that connection: please make sure that any CD-ROM uses
RockRidge format (UNIX long file names).  It would be a real pain to
be limited to DOS-style naming.

Not a problem.

Seems reasonable.

Warren,
and the rest of us!
Thanks!
Everyone who has commented has covered all the same ground that I would
with the license discussion!
I will take what I can get to be legal!
Thanks for all the work on this!!

I've been skipping a lot of the discussion about this, but if I read
this license correctly it seems to cover the SCO-owned bits of most of
the 4BSD releases as well.  Of course all the recent ones are free
already, but I don't think that things like 4.2 are, and they're
derived from 32V I think, (or is there held to be an admixture of
stuff from System V?).

I'd be quite interested in 4.2 and 4.3 as I have a machine that runs
4.2 (not a vax...).

I suspect that the 4BSD situation must be fairly well understood by
someone, since there were all these legal arguments a few years ago
when the various PC BSDs started appearing in a big way.

Does anyone know what the real story is?

No, the successor systems are specified as 16-bit, and that excludes the
4BSD systems as they ran on the Vax.

Besides, UCB still owns these systems. Keith Bostic has mentioned that
a back-burner project is to get all the 4BSD releases onto CD-ROMs,
and make them available to people with licenses for 32V. He knows about
the new SCO licenses. Perhaps we can start encouraging him once we get
out licenses?!

P.S Why do you think I fought to get 32V covered by the SCO license?
    I wanted to be able to buy these 4BSD CD-ROMs!

	Are there any UNIBUS/Qbus controllers that can deal with QIC-150?

	I tried putting a Wangtek 5150ES on a Emulex UC08 and it didn't work
	at all.  The only 'QIC' format I've seen work (and which preserves
	record boundaries) is the TK25 (uses the DC600A tapes).  I can 
	make TK25 tapes.

	I can also make 6250bpi 9-track until the tapedrive wears out (at
	which point I'm unlikely to sink the rather high $$$ to repair/replace
	it - 4mm drives are a lot cheaper ;-)).

	I think a CD is a good way to go - it can be used as the 'baseline'.
	The updates to 2.11 are publically available via FTP at either
	FTP.IIPO.GTEGSC.COM or MOE.2BSD.COM.  Once a system is loaded from CD
	then only those patches later than the CD need to be retrieved and
	applied.

	Of course!  There will be .MAP files to assist those systems that
	need help with long filenames or deep directories.

Can do TK50, Exabyte, 0.25 SCSI cassette and will build kernels of
anything that I can safely get up on my 11/73.

This will be for UK distrib although I'll send anywhere if the postage
is reimbursed.

PS, I may be able to do TS05 in the future.

Well, yes, but what are the economics of making a couple of hundred
CD-ROMs and then having to download possibly years of additional stuff
to be up to date?

You might remember Ralph Cramden, from the _Honeymooners_, claiming that
he was going to wait for 3-D TV before he bought one.

What are you going to do - wait until Steven dies (I swear he'll be releasing
updates to 2BSD for the rest of his life) before making a CD?

Incidentally, a couple of weeks ago I made a nice bootable Iomega ZIP
cartridge with the current 2.11 generic kernel and everything in /usr.  It all
barely fits in the 100 Mbytes (well, 3*65536*512 bytes) available, and
it's a hell of a lot more convenient for installs on Unibus and Q-bus
-11's with SCSI host adapters than the traditional tape distribution.

It's also worth pointing out that on the Q-bus SCSI host adapters that I
have - the CMD CQD440, the Emulex UC08, and the Andromeda SCDC - bootable
CD-ROM distributions are entirely possible.  I'm not sure if 2.11BSD will
boot from a read-only device - Steven, have you tried this?

Well, no, I had made a suggestion that, with the quantities involved,
it might be easier to burn WORMs.

	the 11/73.  Alas, the QIC style of drives don't work, at least not

	Uh, 2.11 doesn't know how to deal with 2048 byte sectors or the 
	ISO9660 filesystem.  Now a MO drive that used 512 byte sector'd
	media should work just fine - but that style of drive is fading

	It'll panic.  For a couple reasons:  pipes are implemented via
	the filesystem rather than sockets so anything involving pipes
	needs a rw filesystem.  And a swap area is needed.  If there's
	memory available there won't be any actual swapping going on but
	argument gathering, etc during an 'exec' can use a small amount of
	swap space.  It might be possible to use a 'ram' disk but it's not
	clear to me it'd be worth the trouble.

On my Andromeda SCDC, the effective transfer rate to the Q-bus is just
under a megabyte per second.  In other words: damn fast.  (Fast
7200 RPM SCSI-II hard drives will get 1.5-2 Mbyte second).  Booting
from ZIP is far, far faster than booting from a RD54.  I posted some
benchmarks to vmsnet.pdp-11 two months or so ago.

That aren't all that rare.  You just have to go someplace other than
Fry's, that's all :-).

The problem is that most QIC devices are commonly operated in fixed-size-
block mode, something that TMSCP doesn't really grok well unless its
hidden under a layer that hides this and allows for variable-sized
"virtual" blocks.  (Your TK25 takes care of all of this for you
automagically.)

That's OK.  The MSCP controllers make each 2048 byte sector look like
4 512-byte blocks.  And you don't need to lay down a ISO9660 filesystem;
if you throw away the idiotic software that comes with the PC-clone
CD-ROM writers, you can put any filesystem you like down.  I've
built bootable RT-11 CD-ROM's this way.

RT-11 also wants a writable swap file, and this is indeed provided by
using a RAM disk (i.e. VM:).

It depends on how convenient you find installation from CD-ROM :-).  I find
the bootable ZIP disk very convenient for "recovery media", and they're
a whole lot easier to fit in my shirt pocket than a RL02 cart!
