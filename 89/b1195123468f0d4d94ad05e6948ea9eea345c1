Subject: [TUHS] Anyone have a copy of the TUHS archive available for rsync?
Message-ID: <200712210935.lBL9ZJUK004685@skeeve.com>

Hi. Warren and I seem to be on opposite ends of the world network wise,
such that I am unable to rsync to minnie to keep my copy of the TUHS
archive up to date.

Does anyone out there in TUHS land have a copy they're willing to make
available for syncing?

Thanks!

Arnold Robbins
