One minor detail that I forgot: it was the (mostly male) computer
operators who asked us to plot both their biorhythms of their (mostly
female) partners, and themselves, to see if they were compatible...

I think we (not me) began charging their department per plot, as that
thermal paper was pretty pricey...  Hey, it was all funny money, after 
all!

This was the 70s/80s, man...
