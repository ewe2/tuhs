Well now I have to laugh... loomcom.com is my own server. Apparently I had old versions of trn and nn *right under my own nose*. That just goes to show how badly I need to curate that big dump of 3B2 stuff I've been hoarding.

Thank you for finding that.

(By the way, I reorganized recently. Everything under https://static.loomcom.com/3b2/software moved to https://static.loomcom.com/3b2/software_archive/ so I could build a brand new repository under the 'software' directory.)
