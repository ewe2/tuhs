That is awesome, thanks for the story and link.  Enlightening to read
about how the coherence protocol was developed in software.  How was
the ISA, and I assume even implementation detail, kept equal or close
enough to the eventual microprocessor parts?  Does the "Privileged
Architecture Library" mean it was effectively microcoded?  What kind
of software structure was used to provide the I/O channel on the
DECStations, for instance did it map the other TURBOChannel devices
into the demo's address space so it ran the stock device drivers, or
was the I/O server software intermediating a mailbox for doing SCSI,
Ethernet etc with a different device model?

Reminds me of a book I really liked "The Supermen: The Story of
Seymour Cray and the Technical Wizards Behind the Supercomputer",
especially Seymour Cray's willingness to throw out convention and
redefine the game.  Corollary to Larry's point about CPU designers
losing by only competing against their own last design.. you can
either make new markets or lead in the ongoing one, not a lot of air
outside that.

Regards,
