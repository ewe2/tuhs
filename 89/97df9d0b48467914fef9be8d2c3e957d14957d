True, but possible since some time, for the thing i maintain, too,
unfortunately.  It will be easy starting with the next release,
however.

Yes.  Yes.  And then, whilst not breaking the thread stuff as
such, there is the "current funny thing to do", which also impacts
thread visualization sometimes.  For example replacing spaces with
tabulators so that the "is the same thread subject" compression
cannot work, so one first thinks the subject has really changed.
At the moment top posting seems to be a fascinating thing to do.
And you seem to be using DMARC, which irritates the list-reply
mechanism of at least my MUA.
