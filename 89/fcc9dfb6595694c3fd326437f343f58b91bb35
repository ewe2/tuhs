It sounds more like:

Early 1980s: C MMDF translated to VMS Pascal.
1999: PMDF translated anew to C by Sun.

I briefly remember having MMDF at Georgia Tech, I think in the 4.1 BSD
time frame; it was used for CSNet and UUCP for USENET / UUCB mail. Then
when 4.2 came along, I think it was dropped for Sendmail.

But I *really* don't remember the details, just that MMDF was in use
on one of the systems I used a long time ago.

Thanks,

Arnold
