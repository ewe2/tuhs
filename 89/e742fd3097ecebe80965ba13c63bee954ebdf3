If you want to understand the PDP-11 assembly language, any of them will do.

If you want to understand the MMU and some esoteric stuff, it might be a 
good idea to get one of the books that actually cover the exact 
processor you're interested in.

The basic instruction set is the same on all of the processors. There 
are some very minor differences, but those are not even properly 
documented in most of these books, and relate to how condition codes are 
affected for some odd cases that you normally don't care about.

The major groupings you can do with the PDP-11 systems are otherwise if 
they have split I/D space, supervisor mode, unibus map and 22-bit 
addressing, floating point (none/FIS/FPP) and EIS.
Rougly, you can say:

11/34: EIS. Optional FPP.
11/40: None of that. Optional EIS and FIS.
11/44: All of it. Optional FPP.
11/45: split I/D, supervisor, EIS. Optional FPP.
11/60: EIS. Optional FPP.
11/70: All of it. Optional FPP.
