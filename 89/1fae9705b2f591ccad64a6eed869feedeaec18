Yup. I used an AT&T 3b1/7300 all through college. 
No ethernet. Polled for mail using dialup/UUCP.
I still have a couple 3b1 machines stored in the
garage...strange to think that the L2 caches on
the Xeon 5410 CPUs in my web server are larger than 
the entire hard drive in my old UNIXpc. Shouldn't 
computers be doing a whole lot more by now?

Maybe of mild interest to some, here is a scan of a
page from an old Byte article with benchmark data
comparing the 3b1 to some of its peers at the time
(TRS-80, VAX11/780, PC XT). Apologies for the quality 
of the image. Some day I'll dig out the originals and
re-scan everything..
