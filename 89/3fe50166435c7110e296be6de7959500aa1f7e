Subject: [TUHS] news about the Data General Eclipse 
Message-ID: <20050904151718.GA20124@freaknet.org>


well,

we discovered that we have MV/UX installed together with AOS/VS,
so we have a weird UNIX running ... under AOS/VS 

:)))

so, our goal is, for now, to preserve the actual system, and
to make a copy of the tapes (now we can use "dd" to read/copy
them)

we're experimenting, stay tuned

we wrote some documentation in http://zaverio.net/eclipse/stuff,
and we will put online some help ASAP

p.s. any help/hint appreciated :)
