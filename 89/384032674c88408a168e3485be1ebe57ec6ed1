Things did happen that way. I don't specifically remember the
numbers, but those you state have the ring of truth.

Memory came in (expensive) 4K increments. When the keepers of
Unix in the Charlotte wire center wanted to add 4K, their
management consented only on the condition that the wizards
in Research would confirm that roposed new functionality
really required it.
