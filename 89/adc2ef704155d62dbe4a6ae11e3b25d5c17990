John Cowan:

  "Between each" has been part of Standard English for a thousand years, and
  still is today.

As in between each pair of elements, or between each element?

The latter strikes me rather like the currently-in-vogue phrase
`one of the only': it may have a defined meaning, but it sure
sounds distractingly stupid.  (If it's one of the group at all,
it's by definition one of the only members; if what is meant is
one of the few, then say so, dammit.)

It's rather like obfuscated C, or nearly any use of Perl: sure,
you can write it to require extra mental effort to make sense of
it, but there are simpler ways to be rude.

Please, sir, I'd like to join The Few.
I'm sorry, there are far too many.
