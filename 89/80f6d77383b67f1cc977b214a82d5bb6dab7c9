Subject: [TUHS] C News: help!
Message-ID: <20170309024210.GA8440@minnie.tuhs.org>

OK, C News is a bit more complicated than I expected :)

The latest version is at ftp://ftp.cs.toronto.edu/pub/c-news/ AFAIKT
and a printable install guide at
http://ftp.cc.uoc.gr/infosystems/news/transport/cnews/doc/guide.ps.gz

Are there any C News experts out there who might be able to help?
Can we encourage Henry or Geoff to help at all?

Cheers, Warren
