Not quite the same but Arthur Whitney, the author of the K array
programming language did something called kOS, mainly to run K apps.
It initially ran on Linux but then on "bare metal". The entire OS +
a graphic layer called z (to replace X11) fit in 62kB. But it seems
he never released it. No idea why. kdb (built on top of K) is a
columnar database. An old article on kOS.

Also note that in mid 80s there was at least one company building
Unix with atomic transactions IO. I forget their name now -- it was
Tolerant Systems or Relational Systems or something. As a contractor
I wrote some testing framework for them for regression testing etc.
As I recall the OS was quite slow. There were a bunch of Unx=20
workstations startups in the Silicon Valley in '80s. Not sure their
stories have been told (and I knew only a few bits and pieces that
I picked up as a contractor and forgot soon).=
