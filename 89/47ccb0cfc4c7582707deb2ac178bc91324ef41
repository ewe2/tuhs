Subject: [TUHS] Historical uucp maps?
Message-ID: <20170308225442.GA15170@minnie.tuhs.org>

We are going to need some historical uucp maps so that we can construct
our simulated uucp network which bears some resemblance to the past.
There is a 1984 map on pages 7 to 14 of
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Documentation/AUUGN/AUUGN-V05.4.pdf

As Dave mentioned, we need some key sites like ihnp4, cbosgd etc.
What other key sites? Any volunteers to run some of them?
