Adapt the panorama mode of a camera to work when you pull the paper past its view?

This reminds me of a tale.  At my MIT lab around 1975 we had a Xerox 3100 (maybe?) copier we used to copy 11x17 hardware schematics.  It pulled the original and output paper, slightly offset, past opposite sides of the image drum.  I don’t know what possessed me to try it, but I found it would continuously copy fad-fold printer output onto fan-fanold paper, while advancing the copy counter only once.
