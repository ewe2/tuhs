Hello!
I can certainly attest to that one. The partition methods Slackware
was using for releases before 3.0 were stranger then a lot of things.
For release 3.0 and later it all started to make sense. I had more
problems thought figuring out why several others really wanted me to
break up the disk into a batch of individual ones......

However while exploring both NetBSD and FreeBSD I did workout why they
wanted the disk broken out into those slices.
