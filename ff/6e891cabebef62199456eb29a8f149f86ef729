Rough timeline

V6           mid 75
1BSD      mid 77 (pascal, ex, but no vi)
2BSD      late 78 (vi, though from a 1979 copy in tuhs no curses yet, but
with termcapish things dated April 79)
V7           early 79
3BSD      late 79
2BSD      April 80 (the 2.79 in the archives, by this point curses was
added to the tape)
4BSD      mid 80 (with curses)
2.8/4.1BSD mid 81 (first unified kernel+userland pdp-11 distro)

So curses library wasn't on the 3bsd tape. It may have been on the 4bsd
tape: all I can find is libtermcap on tuhs, but kirk's archive has a
curses library data October 1980. The late 2BSD tapes (called 2.79BSD in
our archive) is the earliest artifact I can find. It appears curses wasn't
widely available until midish 1980: the 2.79BSD tape has a July 17, 1980
date on the docs (being the earliest artifact I could find) and a Jan 1981
on the sources. The earliest net.sources archive I can find starts in 1982.
The latest 2BSD tape we have in the archive from April 1979 does not have
it.

A binary of rogue is on the 2.8BSD and 4.1BSD tapes. 2.8 has 'version 3.4'
but no sources and 4.1 has vers 4.22 in a 4.0 upgrade directory, but no
sources either:

-r--r--r--  1 root  wheel   70364 May 21  1981 ./2.8/usr/bin.v7/ucb/rogue
-r-xr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   96356 Mar 13  1982 ./4.1.snap/usr/games/rogue
-r-xr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   96356 Mar 13  1982
./4.1/4.0.upgrade/usr/games/rogue

Even in 4.2 it looks like most of rogue was distributed as a binary .o
file, and needed the updated net.sources version of libcurses, distributed
with 4.2bsd.

So from a tracing the artifacts for libcurses, we get an interesting
diversion, but nothing conclusive.
