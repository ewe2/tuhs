Who’s heard David Beazley tell his epic Python hacking saga? 

He’s a true hacker’s hacker, who wrote SWIG, and eats, breaths and shits Python in his sleep. 

David Beazley: Discovering Python - PyCon 2014
Speaker: David Beazley
So, what happens when you lock a Python programmer in a secret vault containing 1.5 TBytes of C++ source code and no internet connection? Find out as I describe how I used Python as a secret weapon of "discovery" in an epic legal battle.
