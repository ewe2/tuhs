Ah; didn't realize you wanted the exact time, not just a date! :-)

Well, according to this:

  http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/museum/ddn-news/ddn-news.n19.1

it was _planned_ to happen at "00:01 (EST) 1 Jan 1983". Whether it did happen
at that moment, or if in reality there was some variance, I don't know (IIRC,
I was off sailing in the Caribbean when it actually happened :-).
