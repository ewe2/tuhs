I still heart BASIC. I enjoy it's simplicity. I started out on BASIC 
with a Commodore Pet ca. 1978. I still like to fire it up every now and 
then - Chipmunk on my Macbook, BAS/BAS2 on RSTS/11, RSX-11, BBC basic? 
on RISC OS, doesn't matter, they all do a fair job of BASIC. I 
especially like firing up  Berhard's pdp 8 simulator with teletype 
emulation and coding on the teletype - 
https://www.bernhard-baehr.de/pdp8e/pdp8e.html. Unix... well, I've not 
been real successful in getting it to work on v6, other folks maybe, but 
not me. By work, I mean, I type in reasonable BASIC and it runs 
reasonably :). The bas executable work fine, it's the human-computer 
interface that doesn't seem to wanna work, nothing I type in as a 
program more complex than 'hello, world' will run with any reliability.

On another note, I remember the days when people bad mouthed lovers of 
BASIC (in industry) and acted as though they were simpletons, later they 
became haters on VB folks. When I learned C, in my twenties, I felt 
empowered, but at the same time hamstrung, some of the simplest things 
in BASIC became an odyssey in C. Nowadays, I use Python more than 
anything else these (boring data sciency stuff). What I like about 
Python is that it reminds me of BASIC in its simplicity of expression, 
but to be fair, it goes far, far beyond it in power... I just wish it 
were as free form as Ruby in how you say, what you say... any, I digress...

My favorite BASIC book:

My Computer Likes Me*
*when I speak in BASIC

by Bob Albrecht

Written in 1972 (for a teletype interface)

On a less positive note. The professors who originally developed it at 
Dartmouth could never quite see there way clear to open source it. True 
BASIC? pshaw :). There was a time when I would have loved to run BASIC 
on linux, bsd, then Mac and have it be consistent across the platforms, 
other than as a curiosity, that time has gone.

My question for the group is what's BASIC's history in the unices? I 
know it's in v6, cuz I struggled with it there, but I'm curious what the 
backstory is? I have the impression that the marriage of bas and v6 was 
one of convenience, maybe there was a thought to draw in the hobbiest? 
Were Kemeny and Kurtz characters in the same circles as the unix folks?


Later,

Will

                DEC's RSTS/11 and the HP/2100 running BASIC were the two
                systems that ended up being used by a lot of small
                timesharing shops and eventually on-site at the high
                schools that could afford the HW. </span><span

                reason being that BASIC became popular on the small
                system was it required fewer resources and because it
                was primarily interpreted matched.  An urban legend is
                that when Gates opened in Microsoft in AZ, he bartered
                time from the local high school running their RSTS
                system for them in return for being able to use it as
                their development system [I definitely know that he used
                their system, I'm just now sure how he renumerated them
                for the computer time].</span></font></div>

                or CP/M box.  The BASIC's often worked out of ROM. 
                 Hey, I can think of implementations of other languages
                such as FORTRAN's, C, Cobol, PL/M, PL/1, and eventually
                many Pascals for the different micro's, but they all

                enough.'  The only HS in the late 1970s that I knew that
                could afford a PDP 11/45 and actually ran UNIX on it,
                was Lincoln-Sudbury - which is in a high-end suburban
                Boston.  They also had a lot of help from parents who
                per professionals here in Boston working for places like
                DEC, DG, Pr1me, Honeywell, and the like.   At that time,
                I was long gone, but I now my father at my own prep
                school in suburban Philadelphia dreamed of an 11/40
                class system to run RSTS, but they could not afford it. 
                So if they wanted off a timesharing service like the
                HP/21000, they bought small microprocessor (CP/M or
                Apple-II) gear and ran them as a hobbyist would.</font></div>

                Pascal), there was some of that.  I used to say the

                the GE-635 when I was in JHS), knew only BASIC and
                FORTRAN because that was what he had learned working
                part-time as a 'computer' at Rocketdyne in the late
                1950s/early 1960s.   By the late 60s, he was the first
                'computer teacher' at the prep school when I went (in
                Philadelphia, but not that dissimilar to Bill Gates's
                experiences in Seattle at a local prep school there). 
                He taught us what he knew and <i>what he had access to</i>.
                Eventually, I outpaced him a bit, and I started to learn
                a little assembler for the HP because I was curious. 
                But I came to a point where I knew way more than he did
                before I left HS [BTW: Gates and Allen tell a similar
                story - of learning PDP-10 assembler at some point --
                advancing ahead of their teachers].  The truth is I
                think my Dad was a bit ahead of his time, <i>but he did
                  not know what he did not know </i>and did know to try
