Subject: [TUHS] Package Management
Message-ID: <CAEdTPBfKWDw2Q_96Z0TNFqy2NrdVcu-b0ZCDBSg3Fm5kR_+rew@mail.gmail.com>

The recent discussion of Solaris made me think - what was the first Unix to
have centralized package management as part of the OS?  I know that IRIX
had it, I think from the beginning (possibly even for the GL2 releases) but
I imagine there was probably something before that.
