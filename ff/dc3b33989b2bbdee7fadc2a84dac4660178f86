Yes, awful terminals demand different editors.

At Amdahl, we had nothing but 3270s for the mainframe UNIX.
Dan Walsh wrote an editor - "ned" - which allowed full screen editing. It
was actually quite nice, considering. It allowed any "ed" commands in a
command line, but ISPF-like block editing elsewhere.

I wrote the 3270 driver which allowed "almost" full duplex interaction with
UNIX.
