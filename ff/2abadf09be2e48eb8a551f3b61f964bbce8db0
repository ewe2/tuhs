Thanks for the (omitted) explanation.  At first sight, the instruction
almost seems to make sense for functions with a variable number of
parameters, but of course there are simpler ways to do it.

I wonder if this is a case of "it sounded like a good idea at the
time" (when the instruction set was being designed), and it took a
while for people to realize that it wasn't of any use.

I recall a similar issue with the Siemens 306, their first stack-based
machine, round about 1975.  They had function call and return
instructions which manipulated the stack pointer, but it seemed that
nobody used them: they didn't work.  From memory, the call instruction
incremented the stack pointer and stored PC.  The return call
instruction decemented the stack pointer and loaded PC--from the wrong
location.

I never used the 306 myself, but I often wondered if they modified one
of the instructions to DTRT.
