Warner,

I should have copies of it, I'm also in email contact with both Tom T. (aka
tjt - who is someone I reference often on this list) and Janet (Tom often
weekly).

As for history, until Janet created that document for Masscomp, nothing
existed other than a short paper I believe Dennis wrote for V6 and updated
for V7.   Cliff and Tom A had spent hours in Tom and my shared office
picking our brains.  What they came up with was not quite right (to be
polite) and tjt attempted to fix it - which at least was technically
correct.   Janet has the head of Masscomp's documentation group, re-wrote
Tom's version to make it easier to understand.  I should have the version
in my files [Janet might even have the original troff sources].

When Tim O'Reilly (who had been writing a lot of our doc under contract and
started to do the original 'nutshell' series) cut a deal to take the
documentation he was writing for us 'out of Masscomp' and publish it (thus
creating the original X-Windows documentation and the first real hit for
ORA), precedent had been set.

Shortly after, Tom and I had left for Belmont, ney Stellar, and Janet and
Tom decided to redo it as a book.
