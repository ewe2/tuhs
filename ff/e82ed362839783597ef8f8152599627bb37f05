I think my sentence was confusing: it is ~25KB each, so about 50KB =
combined.

The original V6 kernel was about 29KB (says here =
https://www.tuhs.org//cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3DV6). I've simplified the =
TTY driver, only support one type of disk driver, dropped shared text =
segments, dropped FP emulation. Remains about 25KB. Note that the SLIP =
is merely via a "super RAW" mode on the TTY driver, so I don't need to =
include the bulky IMP interface driver. Even at 30KB, the V6 kernel must =
have offered the best bang/buck ratio in the history of software, imho.

:^) See here: =

"Someday this will be generated from the configuration file." I think =
later it did, but I don't have that code.

I has been a journey. I started with the 2.11BSD compiler and ported =
that to the TI990 architecture (more precisely the 9995 chip, which is =
similar to a T11 chip).
I debugged that to make XINU run, and then moved on to LSX (as recovered =
by the BK-UNIX project). Then I started with the V6 kernel from the TUHS =
website and made that work. Dave Pitts made it work on a real TI990 (he =
has a TI990/10 and a TI990/12 in working order). So, yes, I did =
bootstrap all the low level stuff from scratch.

After a three year hiatus I resumed work on this, integrating the =
Gurwitz TCP stack.

The journey is documented here:
http://1587660.websites.xs4all.nl/cgi-bin/9995/timeline

The network code is in a different tree, I'll move it over to the above =
tree over the weekend.
