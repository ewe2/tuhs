The AT&T lawsuit (April 1992) post-dated Linus starting on his work (eg
0.12 released January 1992). He said in an interview once he was unaware
that net/2 was out and could be leveraged to get a working system when he
started. It did give a big boost to Linux at a critical time due to the
huge amount of FUD that it created over BSD's future.
