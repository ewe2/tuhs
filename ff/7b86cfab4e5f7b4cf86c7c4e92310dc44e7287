Subject: [TUHS] UK written UNIX line editor in early 80s?
Message-ID: <CANuZA8S8H-whmzRQnsMufAPoAqPKgZi6nkYGha+-d5RE6nvi1g@mail.gmail.com>

In the autumn of 1984 as an undergrad at Durham University (UK) I
remember using a Pascal compiler (pc) on a BSD4.1 system (bumped after
several months to 4.1c and running I would guess on a small VAX?) and
using a strange line editor (probably because the terminal had crude
screen handling capabilities?).

I can't remember much about it other than it seemed to resemble ex.  I
think I was told it was written in the UK and doing some Googling
suggests it may have been "em" (Editor for Mortals) from Queen Mary
College.

However, the time frame for that editor was late 70s and it would have
been quite old by 1984. So my current theory is that it was a fork
(maybe with a different name) or later version?

Anyone use this editor or anything similar around 1984?
