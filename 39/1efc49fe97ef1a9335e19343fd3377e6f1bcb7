As a *roff guy to the core, to this day, I'd love to see any docs on the 
Multics version and/or the CTSS version.

Roff has some pretty sophisticated stuff (environments come to mind) that
I think 99.9% of the CS world doesn't understand (sort of like my rant
on SCCS, most people didn't look hard enough to get it.  I'm not sure
that I get roff environments to this day but I kinda do).

I'd love to see the docs on that early stuff and see if Joe Ossanna
added in his own magic or was he carrying forward earlier magic.

P.S.  I love this list for this stuff, I'm an old retired guy that 
wishes he could have helped birth Unix.  Hanging out with the people
who were there is super fun.
