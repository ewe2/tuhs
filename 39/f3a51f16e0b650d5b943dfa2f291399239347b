Subject: [pups] Boot_Images and the networking activated version of Simh
Message-ID: <7AD18F04B62B7440BE22E190A3F7721407C6AE@mwsrv04.microwalt.nl>

People,

DO note that the Ethernet operations of SimH heavily depend on the proper
workings AND configuration of a Packet Filter driver for your platform,
so, something like BPF, EFILT, NetFLT or WinPCAP (for Win32).  Try running
a test app for that stuff BEFORE trying to run SimH/ENET stuff.. if the
test app works OK, you can start figuring out why SimH/ENET doesn't work
on your system.

I have *three* network cards the drivers of which DO NOT support promisc
mode.  Which obviously results in WinPCAP (they're PCI cards under Win2K)
not functioning properly, and, thus, same for SimH/ENET.
