Hi Dave,

> the ADM-3a was certainly one of my favourites

Mine too;  my first.  Spent longer with the ADM 11 though, after it,
including an amber model, rather than the vulgar green.  I ended up in
France a few years later with some Silicon Graphics machines, but not
enough of them for the planned Mongolian hoard.  I suggested serial
terminals, like the old days, a batch of redundant ones were sent over
the Channel, and there was my old amber one, that I promptly reclaimed.

Bill Joy used an ADM 3A when writing vi.  That gave hjkl for cursor
movement because they were the cursor keys on the 3A.  And `~' shares
with HOME so I guess he used it for writing csh too.  :-)

Yes, awful.  The guy I faced over the desk had one and used VMS;  they
suited one another.  Not the guy, the terminal and OS.  It did mean he
could provide access to nethack though.
