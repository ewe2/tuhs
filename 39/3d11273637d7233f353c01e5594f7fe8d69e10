Subject: [TUHS] Disk Drivers
Message-ID: <3BE1B78E.9BDF470F@apple.com>

I'm getting a tad frustrated with the otherwise excellent Supnik PDP-11
emulators.

Can anyone tell me (or give me the adb commands to figure it out myself) what
disk device drivers are present in the bootable disk images that come with the
Supnik simulator? The versions I'm interested are:

V6 image:
- rkunix (rk)
- rkunix.40 (rk, PDP-11/40 cpu?)
- unix

V7 image:
- hphtunix (hp)
- hptmunix (hp)
- rkunix (rk)
- rl2unix (obviously hacked to include rl driver)
- rphtunix (rp)
- rptmunix (rp)
