I think it goes at the end in every case except for varargs functions,
where we wouldn't be able to know which one was last easily.

I like the idea: essentially it's about reading or writing an array

No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the
continent, a part of the main.  If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a
manor of thy friends or of thine own were: any man's death diminishes me,
because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for
whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.  --John Donne
