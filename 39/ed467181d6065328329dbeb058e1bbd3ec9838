There's a TRIPOS archive on his web pages; I don't know if there's
anything more comprehensive dating back to when it was being used in the
1980s.

He retired in 2007, though I think he can be found in his college if not
in the Computer Lab.

A few notes on the pictures:

Maurice Wilkes can be seen on the left in photo 1967.

Chris Cheney is on the left in photo 8317. Chris invented his eponymous
copying garbage collector algorithm when working on ALGOL 68 with
Steve Bourne.

The green door was preserved from the original Mathematical Laboratory
building that housed EDSAC and its successors until about 1970; the brass
plaque records the names of those who worked in the old building and
stuck around long enough to retire after Wilkes.

Tony.
