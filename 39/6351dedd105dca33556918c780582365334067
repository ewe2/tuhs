As much as I love all the nostalgia, and as cool as SLIP was, if I never
have to experience the pain of trying to run TCP/IP over a modem again,
I'll be happy.  For me, SLIP was just not worth it.  Too much overhead
when bandwidth was too precious.  A dial up terminal emulator was a
better answer in my experience.

Don't get me wrong, SLIP was cool.   Modems were slow.
