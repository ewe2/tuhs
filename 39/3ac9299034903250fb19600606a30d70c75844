Ah; as I said, I still bear the scars...

Basically, I tried to create aus.bizarre (modelled after alt.bizarre) but 
some did not like it, and promptly removed it.  To cut a long story short, 
it involved a newgroup/rmgroup war, which sadly I lost :-(

It also just about brought ACSnet to its knees, because I automated my 
side of things (I don't know what John did, but it was likely automated 
too).  I guess you had to be there...

After that, though, Iron Bar and I became friends.
