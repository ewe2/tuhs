This one line hit me hard:

> PPS: Bob Swartz is the father of the late Aaron Swartz.

Small world.  The fact that he is still doing good things after losing his

I'm a guy who would probably have gone postal if I lost my son.  My heart
and admiration goes out to Bob.

On a fun note, I remember Coherent, it was fun.
