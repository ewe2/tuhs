Aha! So the first file gets transferred correctly?
Then your problem is totally withing that transferred file. My guess is
that it don't know your hardware well enough.

Does your machine have EIS? Does the code expect EIS to exist? How about
22-bit mode? I/D space?
FP perhaps?

There are a lot of potential problems...

So? If you even manage to get the first file accress, the problem isn't
anything with your communication link.
