Light your cigar with disk blocks!

When I was in high school, I had an account on the school's computer, a
PDP-11/20 running RSTS, with a single RF11 disk (well, technically, an RS11
drive on an RF11 controller). For those whose jaw didn't bounce off the floor,
reading that, the RS11 was a fixed-head disk with a total capacity of 512KB
(1024 512-byte blocks).

IIRC, my disk quota was 5 blocks. :-)
