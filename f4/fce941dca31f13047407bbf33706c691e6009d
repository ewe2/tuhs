Perhaps I meant named.conf (part of BIND):

    named.conf is the configuration file for named. Statements are enclosed
    in braces and terminated with a semi-colon. Clauses in the statements
    are also semi-colon terminated. The usual comment styles are supported:

    C style: /* */

    C++ style: // to end of line

    Unix style: # to end of line

Where did you get

    ; But this?
