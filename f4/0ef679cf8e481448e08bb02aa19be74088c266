Probably faster than the 3B1 was in real life.    Being an educational=20
institution in NJ (Rutgers) we had all sorts of AT&T stuff donated to=20
us, 3B2's, 3B5's, and 3B20's.

The 3B2 was the first machine that I came across I think with a soft=20
power switch.  Amusingly, the thing would not let you shut it down=20
unless you were root (apparently, you don't have power switch privs as a=20
normal user).

Of course, this was in contrast with the 3B20 which you powered off by=20
turning a knob and then holding a button down for three seconds.   Yep,=20
phone equipment.   Those who ever dealt with things like real Western=20
Electric 303 "broadband" modems recognized that behavior.  You commanded=20
loopback on them the same way.
