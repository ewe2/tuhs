I will create one today or tomorrow:

	tuhs at minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au	Unix Heritage

	pups at minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au	PDP-11 Unix

You will all be subscribed to both lists. To be removed from a list,
send e-mail to majordomo at minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au with the line

	unsubscribe pups, or
	unsubscribe tuhs

For those on the digested list (twice weekly), ditto except

	unsubscribe pups-digest, or
	unsubscribe tuhs-digest

I will announce the new list(s) using them as a vehicle soon. That way,
the announcement becomes some test mail :)

Until then, tolerate the system-specific e-mail for just a bit longer.

Cheers,
	Warren

Hi Warren,

I was wrong for my email.  The feed back has been that people like the
combined list.  I have to admit I too like to see some of the PDP-11
info.  I just felt the last thread had gotten off topic when it moved on
to purely PDP-11 hardware.  I have been told I was wrong.

Everybody, here is a person who has courage & honesty. Thanks for that, David.

However, I will still create two groups, because it will allow
more specific content to be addressed where relevant.

Cheers!

So do I. Actually I can understand the need of some participants to
somehow reduce their mail volume. On the other side, it seems to be
quite difficult to draw the exact line between on- and
offtopic. Personally I try to filter as good as I can, and admittedly I
do not read everything at once (and sometimes only weeks later).

I don't really think it makes any difference.  Structure one archive
well, and you can get the individual platform archives simply by going
down a directory level.  The problem is, of course, that some software
can be relevant to multiple platforms.

I'd be inclined to go for the hardware platform, but I haven't thought
it through.  Ultimately it would probably depend on the nature of the
software that came in.

No, I don't think so.  But you might be able to twist my arm.

No.

Personally I'd like it to be all-encompassing, but then, it's only a
small part of the 1000 messages I get per day, and it's easy to delete
messages I don't want to read.

That really happened, didn't it?
