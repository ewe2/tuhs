But It was (check the dates listed in the DDJ articles and the dates of Linus's first email).  He just did not know the FTP path to down load it.   Which is sort of funny because it was not particularly secret between most BSD users.  Jordan was pretty liberal at giving it to people if he believed they had access to a BSD license which just about anyone at a university (like Linus was at the time). 

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.

Linux original took off (and was successful) not because of GPL, but in spite of it and later the GPL would help it.  But it was not the GPL per say that made Linux vs BSD vs SunOS et al.

At that time, *BSD (and SunOS) were much farther along in the development and stability.   But .... may of us hought Linux would insulate us from losing UNIX on cheap HW because their was not AT&T copyrighted code in it.    Sadly, the truth is that if AT&T had won the case, all UNIX-like systems would have had to be removed from the market in the USA and EU [NATO-allies for sure].

I think in that parallel universe, Linux wouldn't have made it particularly far: absent the legal angle, what would the incentive had been to work on something that was striving to basically be Unix, when really good Unix was already available?
