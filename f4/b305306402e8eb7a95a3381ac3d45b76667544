<br>
<br>
This is quite strange for me. Without looking at your system I can only<br>
suspect it has something to do with multithreading.<br>
<br>
If I do two different commands as root, with firefox pid here<br>
.eq. 12331, as above:<br>
<br>
=3D&gt;=C2=A0 (500 15):=C2=A0 =C2=A0 lsof -p 12331 | wc -l<br>

 -l<br>
22055<br>
<br>
The first column gives a name, and in second case it not always is<br>
&#39;firefox&#39;. I am yet to study manpage for lsof and play with it, but=
 it<br>
surely shows interesting things.<br>
<br>
On my system, when firefox gets killed, &#39;free&#39; shows a difference -=
 if<br>
I recall, free mem increases by the size of rss plus all the stuff<br>
which was opened and released from buffers. I did not pay much<br>
attention, I assumed numbers would match and this is what they<br>
probably did :-).<br>
<br>
OS on my box used to report to me as Debian, and still does, but some<br>
years ago I have decided to skip the usual system upgrade, and after<br>
some more time I started to upgrade various elements by hand. So it is<br>
more like a tattered patchwork right now. But it does what I expect,<br>

<br>

&gt; That&#39;s a _factor almost 2300x_ difference between the reported RSS=

<br>
Yeah, strange.<br>
