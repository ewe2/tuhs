Well, not wanting to start a flame war here, but I don't use emacs.  While
it's a good piece of software, I just want a text editor.  Emacs sort of
violates my UNIX-sense as it does many things instead of doing one thing
well.

But really the issue is that info introduced a new interface on a system
that already had one that people were accustomed to.  This is something
that perpetually annoys me in the software world; people introducing new
ways of doing things that aren't improvements, just different.  Just makes
life harder for everyone else.

As an example, I recently did a deep dive trying to figure out why promises
were added to JavaScript.  Actually has nothing to do with the first
10000000000 search results.  They were done for a particular reason that I
don't agree with but were an excuse for someone to force their preferred
coding style on others.  And the details are not a topic for this list.
