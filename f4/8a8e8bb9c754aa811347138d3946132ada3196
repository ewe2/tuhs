This is done on a UNIX implementation that uses STREAMS.

SVr4 is such a UNIX.

lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root          29 Mrz  3  2009 /dev/bge -> ../devices/pseudo/clone at 0:bge
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root          38 Mrz  3  2009 /dev/bge0 -> ../devices/pci at 0,0/pci1462,6710 at b:bge0

/dev/bge is a clone device and allows to access and plumb further devices.
/dev/bge0 is the first Broadcom Gigabit Ethernet device.
