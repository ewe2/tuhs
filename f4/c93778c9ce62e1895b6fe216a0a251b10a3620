Most of I've seen is the stuff I found while playing with Amiga UNIX,
which is the stuff hosted at atariunix.com.  I was able to pull the
Motif (v 1.1.1) bits out of the Atari UNIX disk images and get them
running on Amiga UNIX.

Speaking of old versions of Motif, are the sources for the pre-OpenMotif
bits available anywhere?  Even if under lock and key for now, I'd be
happy knowing they'd been preserved for potential future availability.
