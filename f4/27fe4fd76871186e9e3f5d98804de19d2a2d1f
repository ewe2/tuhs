	I don't know what the problem with Ultrix is but I suspect
	your trouble with System-III is similar to what I wasted a couple
	days on eons ago

	Spent a fruitless couple days trying to get Sys-III going on a 11/44
	only to have it dawn on me that Sys-III didn't have *any* UMR support
	except for the DH-11 - thus an 11/70 with MASSBUS devices was the
	only thing Sys-III would run on.   

	As far as I know no effort was put into Sys-III to deal with 22
	bit machines that didn't have a MASSBUS (a la 11/70).  PERHAPS
	that is what is biting you?   Feels likely.   I know that no effort 
	was put in to supporting UMRs on 22bit systems such as the 11/44.

	The Supnik and Begemot emulators offer up a ~kdj-11 (11/53, 73, ...)
	and not an 11/70 so it could be that Sys-III is trying to do 
	something 11/70'ish that KDJ-11 based systems don't offer.

Hi ,
	Im interested in a PDP-11 assembler that has the MACRO-11 syntax,
I got a book, "Introduction to Computer Systems using the PDP-11 and
Pascal" by McEwans, Thought it would be nice to have the assembler to
check out. I hope the assembler is a load and go assembler cum simulator.
I want to check out some PDP-11 assembly on my linux machine.

Does anyone remember a program called "apout" I think that might work for
cross development (learning).

		Bye

Yes, I wrote Apout. It runs user-mode programs from V5, V6, V7, 2.9BSD
and 2.11BSD. So if you could find an assembler for any of these systems
which met your requirements, and produced .o files which could be linked
using the normal Unix linker, you'd be okay.

However, I haven't heard of a Unix assembler with MACRO-11 syntax, and
Apout only runs PDP-11 Unix binaries. So you probably would be better
off with a full emulator running a DEC OS with MACRO-11.

Cheers,
	Warren

Ultrix-11 V3.1 works just fine on my 11/83. I supplied the binary images
to PUPS from the .5" reel tape ;-) So, yes it can work. My PDP is now
running 2.11BSD btw.

Subject: Program to read unknown tapes
Sender: owner-pups at minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au

Hi everyone,

I have already posted this program to the PUPS list back in December 1998, but
people are asking for it again, and also there are people on the Quasijarus
list and not on the PUPS list who want it, so I'm posting it again, to both
lists.

This program can read a tape on a UNIX box without the user having to know
anything about its format. This program automatically determines how many files
are on the tape, what is the record size for each, and whether there are any
oddities such as partial records. It saves each tape file into a separate disk
file and produces a log of everything found on the tape.

It's a simple C program and should compile and run on virtually any UNIX or
UNIX-like system. The original version was written by one guy I met on another
list once and then it was significantly enhanced by me. I include it below as
a uuencoded 'compress -s'ed tarball.
