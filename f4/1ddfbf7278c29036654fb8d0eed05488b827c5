Mirian, I'd love to see your fixes! By the way, you might want to
look at
	http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Bug_Fixes/V6enb
for some changes I applied to V6.

Thanks to Warren and Mirian for helping me to undig the "50 bugs tape"! 
But the "bugs fixes" look more like performance enhancements. Do you know
any real bugs in V6? By "real" I mean a bug, that might crash the system.

I ask this, because my system crashes ones in a while. But I changed it
here and there, so it might be my fault.

Greetings,

Wolfgang

Hmm. It's less work to learn ed, so I took that path :-).
