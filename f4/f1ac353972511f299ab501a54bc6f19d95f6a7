Before V7. The MIT system (~PWB1) says, on the man page for sleep (II), "As of
this writing the system call is still available although the C routine
implmeneting the function uses 'alarm' and 'pause' (II). It will be withdrawn
when convenient."

Probably left the system call there for compiled commands, etc which used it?
