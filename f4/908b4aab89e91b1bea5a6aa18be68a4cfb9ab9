I should've known better before I rush my reply :-) , what I meant was since 
gnu cpio  can uncompress those cpio files , so I assumed that it can be 
uncompressed booted and re packaged as a single .dsk image (like the unix7 
thing) , but since I have no background in pdp11 hardware I am not sure how 
can this be done.

cheers.
