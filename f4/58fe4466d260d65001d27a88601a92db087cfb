Thanks, I had forgotten about that.

The question of device independent graphics is a hard one.  Device
independent graphics had been around for a long time in terms of
various display list processors that got mangled into things like
CORE, GKS, and PHIGS.  But just because, for example, Sun provided
a GKS package on top of SunView didn't make SunView device independent.
You're probably correct that NeWS was not the first window system to
support device independent graphics.  I do believe that it was the
first one to be "ubiquitous" in that the window system itself used
the same graphics as was available to the user.

Doesn't that document just scream "troff" at you?
