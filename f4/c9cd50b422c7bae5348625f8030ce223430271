info pages clearly are redundant. Even worser under linux most of them visu=
alizing man pages, whereas hardly any man page is missing.
They are emacs style help pages in the tradition of twenex/its, and I tell =
you that a few years ago one guy (not me) recommended in the emacs develope=
r list to replace tekinfo by something modern like .html.

Thus the question isn't man or tekinfo for linux documentation but html/mar=
kup or or tekinfo for emacs build-in self documentation.
