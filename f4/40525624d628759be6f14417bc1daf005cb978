Personally I've always strongly preferred that remote apps display on the 
same desktop as local apps.  This offers seemless integration, especially 
if the various servers share /home.

Putting remote apps in a box always struck me as klunky.  Different people 
prefer each of these approaches and there is no need to force everyone in 
to one solution.  Losing the ability to remote display individual apps 
would be a great leap backwards for me, and for lots of others.

FWIW I believe RDP does support per app remote display.

Cheers,

Rob
