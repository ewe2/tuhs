"UNIX" is no longer the name of a codebase.  Technically, it is the name
of a set of standards; in practice, it (usually written "Unix") is the
name of an evolving design tradition.

One time I called in to the central system and started working on a big
thick 'sed' and 'awk' heavy duty data bashing script.  One of the geologists
came by, looked over my shoulder and said 'Oh, that happens to me too.
Try hanging up and phoning in again.'  --Beverly Erlebacher
