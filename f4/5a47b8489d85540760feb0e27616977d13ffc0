True re TOPS-10.

The TOP-10 Pascal compiler was ported from the one for
CDC-6000 (authors: Urs Amman, Kesav Nori and may be others).
The CDC version was what was described in the Pascal User
Manual and Report by Jensen and Wirth. IIRC, someone at Purdue
was maintaining it. I knew it well as I had added formatted IO
for scalars, sets & a few more things that I forget now + I
was studying it with an aim to write my own compiler. I 
believe this was the port:

[Even the portable "P4" Pascal compiler must've been derived
from the same original code as I recognize its code shape and
random stuff like variable names etc.  p4 sources are online
but I don't see the tops-10 ones]
