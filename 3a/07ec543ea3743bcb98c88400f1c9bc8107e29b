That's a great writeup Will. The only comment I have is a pedantic one:
can you write "pdp" as "PDP-11"?

Otherwise, it's highly readable, explain why you did things the whay you
did, and someone else should be able to read your notes and reproduce your
work.

What do you plan to do next?

Cheers, Warren
