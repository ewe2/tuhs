Subject: [TUHS] 386BSD 0.0 booting on Bochs
Message-ID: <AANLkTim8=jba-CsdpONz5hnqJqa5UwNK-eHJfUZLYFpC@mail.gmail.com>

For anyone that is even remotely interested, I found a way to 'cheat'
the install process, and I've gotten 386 BSD 0.0 to install under
bochs.  Qemu is convinced it can't read the disk for a kernel....

But it does work, well as well as 386BSD 0.0 can work.

I'll try to clean up what I can later.......
