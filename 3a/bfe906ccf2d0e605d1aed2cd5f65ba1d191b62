Well, I suppose it depends on what you mean by "early UNIX".  FreeBSD,
NetBSD and OpenBSD are all ports of BSD UNIX to at least the i386
architecture.

Well, I suppose you could start with an early version of NetBSD or
FreeBSD and use the machine-dependent parts to port older versions of
UNIX.  But it's a non-trivial task.
