Thanks for pointing this out. I had no idea.

Unfortunately(?), I'm looking to make my life easier on more "Unix-like
Unix-like systems" (for want of a better term), for the time being
(Linux, BSD, maybe illumos). (I mean, which shell would I use to
accomplish this on Unix?) And, as has already been pointed out, this
approach doesn't allow for global command options before sub-commands,
which pretty much defeats the sub-command approach altogether UI-wise,
I'd say.

Unrelated: I'm still having some technical difficulties with this list,
namely that I don't receive any mail sent to it. (I'm using the Web
archive to keep track of what's happening.) So, for me to be able to
reply to a particular message, it would also have to be sent directly
to me. Sorry for the inconvenience. The problem is already being
worked on.
