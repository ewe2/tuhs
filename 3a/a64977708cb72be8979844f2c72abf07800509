The Rand editor made good use of multiple windows. You could set things =
up so
that two windows would scroll *in sync*. This is handy e.g. when you are =
looking
at two columns or rows that far apart in the same file or in different =
files and
too large so you need to scroll.

Acme makes even better use of multiple windows. Right click on a compile =
error
message in one window and the cursor moves the error causing line in the =
source
file in another window etc. You can repeat as many times as you want.

So I tend to think combining multiple windows and editing can be =
effective.

Finding the "right cut" of functionality is not easy. Scheme or Common =
Lisp?
Editors and a set of tools or an all singing all dancing IDE? Can one =
implement
something like Photoshop as a set of separate tools that can be combined =
any way?

What old style Unix tools give you is isolation and (one way) controlled
communication. Can this model be generalized to a set of Lego blocks out =
of
which one can compose even complex tools such as Photoshop as easily is =
an open
question.=20
