Thanks for giving away my deepest secret for being a contributor to Open
Source projects.  The trick is, you write _something_ that does what you
need, no matter how horrid, and put it out there, and wait for the screams
to roll in and then someone who knows what they're doing to implement it
correctly.

Works almost every time.
