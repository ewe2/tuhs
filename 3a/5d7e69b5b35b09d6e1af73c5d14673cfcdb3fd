This was also late 60s as far as I know.  The documents are dated, and the
first one is in June 1968.

It was a fully functional system when I first started using it.  Heinz may
be able to say more about it if he remembers.

In many respects it wasn't a hugely interesting system in itself as much
as it was a platform for the development of many other interesting
technologies.
