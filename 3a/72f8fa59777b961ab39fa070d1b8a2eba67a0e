Subject: [TUHS] PDP-10 UNIX?
Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1505932857.beebe@gamma.math.utah.edu>

Warner Losh <imp at bsdimp.com> kindly corrected my statement that kcc
compiler on the PDP-10 was done by Ken Harrenstien, pointing out that
it was actually begun by Kok Chen (whence, the name kcc).

I've just dug into the source tree for the compiler, and found this
leading paragraph in kcc5.vmshelp (filesystem date of 3-Sep-1988) that
provides proper credits:

>> ...
>>          KCC is a compiler for the C language on the PDP-10.  It was

I met Ken only once, in his office at SRI, but back in our TOPS-20
days, we had several e-mail contacts.

----------------------------------------

P.S. In these days of multi-million line compilers, it is interesting
to inspect the kcc source code line count:

	% find . -name '*.[ch]' | xargs cat | wc -l
	80298

A similar check on a 10-Oct-2016 snapshot of the actively-maintained
pcc compiler for Unix systems found 155896 lines.
