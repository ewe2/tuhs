You still had to read all those unallocated blocks as zeroes
if you wanted to copy such a "holey" file. I believe it was
Solaris (may be just for zfs?) that added SEEK_HOLE and
SEEK_DATA lseek whence values.

This could've been hidden if only mmap was allowed on files.
Or alternately read/write buffering was done by the kernel
or the {network,file}-server - which can avoid copying in
cases where it makes sense.=20=
