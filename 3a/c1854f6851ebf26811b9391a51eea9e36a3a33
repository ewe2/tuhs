> As far as I remember, Clem's description is correct. The filesystem

> to the file, the file owner is checked to see if the user ID matches.
> If so, then the owner permissions are applied. If not then the group

> file matches one of the groups of which the user is a member and if
> so the group permissions apply. Otherwise the other permissions are
> used.

> In BSD, the group assigned to the file is assigned from the group of

> if that group is a member of the user's group array. The user can only
> change the group ID to one that appears in their group array.
