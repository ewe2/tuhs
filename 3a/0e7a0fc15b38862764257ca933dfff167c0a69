Hello!
I did receive an actual notice to re-enable my subscription to the
list. Both here and on my other address. It was from AT&T. Based on
what you've posted I believe its that the evolving methods of sending
e-mail haven't completely caught up with the way lists manage it.

And thank you for being persistent. And thank you for an amazing list,
it is exactly what I need for my hobby concerning UNIX and BSD and the
PDP-11 and VAX machines. And an even better collection of software
regarding the society.
