Well, I'd say even from an audio perspective DATs were crap.  Just not a
good technology.  Before DATs I used Beta decks with a PCM-601ES for
audio; was better than DAT probably because of the larger geometry.  Same
reason that 9 track tapes last a long time - larger features.

In weird DAT tech, I have (although it's currently loaned out), one of the
SGI Archive Python drives that allows the DDS layer to be turned off so
that audio can be read and written directly.
