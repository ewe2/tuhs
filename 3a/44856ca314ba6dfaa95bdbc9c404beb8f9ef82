386BSD is available here:
http://oldlinux.org/Linux.old/distributions/386BSD/

The 0.0 distribution tree is there, and files for 0.1 , and the few patchkits that survived.

Iâ€™m 99% sure this is that I took to take 0.1 to 0.1-p23 to 0.1-p24 and used that to fill in the missing CVS from NetBSD 0.8 ... before finding it.

Does that have eg. sys/kern/tty.c in it? Or is also missing piles of 
files?

Not without being butchered first. A lot of essential source files are 
missing
from the start until they magically appear in the 4.4BSD-Lite upload.

I'll take another look if I can make sense of how Lite was folded in.
