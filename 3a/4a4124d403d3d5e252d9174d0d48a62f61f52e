Subject: [Unix-jun72] s1 fragments are now in the svn repository
Message-ID: <20080515014608.GA3761@minnie.tuhs.org>

I have just spent some time reconciling the differences between Doug's s1
fragment reconstruction and mine: we both had roughly the same # of errors,
and having the other's work was great. The repository has all the files in
src/cmd. I have not tried to assemble all of them yet, so any reports here
would be good. Remember, the C files will not compile with the existing
compiler.

Cheers,
