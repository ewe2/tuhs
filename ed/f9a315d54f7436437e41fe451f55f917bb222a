​Exactly -- BTW the printed ​binders that Larry mentions were a few years
away.   Brian Redman of Whippany (the 'ber' of honey-dan-ber UUCP), got
them printed in the early 1980s.

​Yup, I'm not sure how many times I read through UPM, but it was a few
times.

What was amazing to me, was compared to say TOPS or even RSTS it seemed
like I could actually understand the whole thing.​

​It was very much a learn as you go.  Ted Kowalski would show up a little
later and start to explain/argue about things that I had confused./wrong.
But my first attempts were pretty lonely.

​I got access to Lyons after Ted showed up.   I was so impressed ;-)​

​Great mind thinks a like.   Although I had to transfer some of the stuff
to the PDP-10​ I had 'tools' there and was still learning the UNIX ones.
I did not understand grep at first. I remember the moment of enlightenment
the first time, I understood what I could do with it.
Seriously, find and grep were the two new tools that changed the way I
started to think about computers.  I had nothing like them on the 10's.

​Yeah, same here.  I spent a lot of time staring at Kernel and Application
code.​
