Many thanks for that post - really interesting!

I had to look up "Pierce Network", and found it described in the Bell =
Journal:
=
https://ia801903.us.archive.org/31/items/bstj51-6-1133/bstj51-6-1133_text.=
pdf

In my reading the Spider network is a type of Pierce network.

However, the network that you remember is indeed most likely different =
from Spider:
- it was coax based, whereas the Spider line was a twisted pair
- there was more than one, whereas Spider only ever had one =
(operational) loop

Condon and Weller are acknowledged in the report about Spider as having =
done many of its hardware details. The report discusses learnings from =
the project and having to tune repeaters is not among them (but another =
operational issue with its 'line access modules=E2=80=99 is discussed).

All in all, maybe these coax loops were pre-cursors to the Spider =
network, without a switch on the loop (=E2=80=9CC=E2=80=9D nodes in the =
Pierce paper). It makes sense to first try out the electrical and line =
data protocol before starting work on higher level functions.

I have no idea what a GLANCE G is...
