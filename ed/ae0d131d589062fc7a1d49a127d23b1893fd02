Plan9 showed that it=E2=80=99s possible to evolve the Unix model to =
encompass new needs without compromising the abstraction, although to be =
fair, it basically addressed only the first 15-20 years of changes since =
V7.  Freedom to break backward compatibility is obviously a key enabler, =
and difficult to manage for a commercial system.=20

Despite its various issues, I think the Mach abstractions also stand up =
well as an insightful effort for their time.

One area that has continued to evolve in Unix, with a trail of (mostly) =
still-supported-but-no-longer-recommended APIs, is asynchronous event =
handling.  mpx, select, poll, kevents, AIO, /dev/poll, epoll, =
port_create, inotify, dnotify, FEN, etc.  What a mess!

Containers, jails, zones, namespaces, etc, is another area with diverse =
solutions, none of which have been sufficiently the Right Thing to be =
adopted by everyone else.

For today=E2=80=99s uses and hardware, the Unix API does too much: rich, =
stateful APIs copying everything from userland to kernel and back again =
=E2=80=94 the context switching and data copying time is prohibitive, =
and so the kernel ends up being bypassed once it=E2=80=99s checked the =
permissions and allocated the hardware resources.  I hesitate to call it =
a micro-kernel model, but the kernel is used less, and libraries and =
services take on more of the work.
