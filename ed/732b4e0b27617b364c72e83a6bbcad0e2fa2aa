Actually OSF/1 T1.0 was shipped to customers. I know because it was on the three Alphas we received at Imperial College in the UK. It also came with an early version of MX, the 32-bit MIPS to 64-bit Alpha translator which we used to get Ghostscript working (essential for our Mathematicians, after getting TeX to compile).

We tried to get Ghostscript ported as soon as the machines were up but failed miserably and were (still am, actually) grateful for MX saving the day.
