The problem is this backronym is the sort of nonsense that attaches to
_all_ computer commands that are not an English word (and a fair few
that are), and that should heavily weigh against the use of people's
willingness to uncritically repeat them in print as a "reliable source".

It may be reasonable, in Wikipedia's role as a "summary of the published
literature", to say something like "some people have suggested" that it
may be an acronym, and to list the sources there, but certainly _not_ to
assert that it was actually intended as one without a source actually
traceable to someone in a position to know.
