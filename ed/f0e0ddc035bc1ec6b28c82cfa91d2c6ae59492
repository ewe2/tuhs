A few days later, GR's receipt for paint arrived on my desk for approval.
That was certainly above my pay grade, so upon weighing personalities,
I decided to pass it two levels up the chain of command to Vic Vyssotsky,
who famously returned it with a formal note that he was not authorized to
approve plant improvements. The fact that Ken was in my department
and GR wasn't (nor was Fred) stoked certain suspicions about the makeup
of the water-tower team.
