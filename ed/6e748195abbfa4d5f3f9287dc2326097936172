So, anyone ever use this feature?


The PDP-11 running RSTS/E 7.2 we had in high school had a quota of 100
blocks. It was almost enough to store three BASIC programs...

At college, our VAX running 4.3BSD used the quota system, but it was weird
in ways I can't recall now.... Maybe I couldn't logout when I was over
quota, but I worked around that with telnet...
