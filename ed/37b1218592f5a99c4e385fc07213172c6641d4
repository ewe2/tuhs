This sounds something like a poor man's version of Literate Programming,
invented by Donald Knuth for TeX et al.

That's another technology that I happen to like personally, but
which never became mainstream.  More's the pity (IMHO).

(I do know about Doug's review of DEK's program in the Programming
Pearls column. I think the problems there were not with Lit Prog
itself, but with how Knuth programs.  My own take on Literate Programming
can be seen at https://github.com/arnoldrobbins/texiwebjr.)

Yes, probably getting off topic, too.
