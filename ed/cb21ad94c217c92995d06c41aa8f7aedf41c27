Subject: Searchable PUPS Mail Archive
Message-ID: <199709080001.KAA11261@henry.cs.adfa.oz.au>

I've set up a searchable archive of the mail from the PDP-11 Unix
mailing list, at
 
        http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/cgi-bin/pups.cgi
 
Let me know of any problems with it. Updates to the archive will be done
manually until I iron out some script bugs!
