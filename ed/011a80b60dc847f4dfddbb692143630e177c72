I would love to hear more about how (and why) you're using Plan9.  I'm 
naively curious.

I forgot about pre-greeting delay.  I also use that.  It's amazing how 
much difference even 1 second makes.

I think it's also amazing how many spam bots try tricks to get around 
spam filtering, like connecting to a high order MX that hypothetically 
has less spam filtering.  -  JunkEmailFilter's Project Tarbaby does 
phenomenal work with that.  Plus, it feeds their RBL which I use as a 
data signal for SpamAssassin.  }:-)

Are you referring to the purported sender?  Or something in your domain?

Are you referring to SMTP Authentication or email addresses?

I have disabled SMTP Authentication on my main MTA and only allow it on 
my MSA.

Thankfully I've not had to deal with those.  (At least not that I'm 
aware of.)

Nice.
