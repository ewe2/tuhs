Wow.  Been a long time since I've thought about that CPU.  Never wrote
any assembler for it but paged through the manuals.   My memories are 
vague but what I remember was sort of feeling like "what's the point?".

Quite a different feeling from when I hit the National 32016 and 32032 
manuals.  That was a chip I so wanted to love (and did, until I used
one, pretty buggy).  But a really sweet chip.
