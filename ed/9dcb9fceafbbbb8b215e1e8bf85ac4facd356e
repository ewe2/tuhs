You can pronounce TeX as if it is written in Cyrillic: Tiyekh!
And then of course, LyaTiyekh!

Though I vastly prefer TeX/LaTeX/XeLaTeX over troff (unlike
most folks on this list) and find even the source code more
legible than ugly control lines starting with a "." -- In *TeX
I can reformat most parahraphs to balance lines, without
things falling aport.

Now one can avoid most of the hassles for simple documentation
by using markdown or asciidoc & tools that generate .tex,
which can be rendered beautifully. Even here you can typically
use LaTeX formatting for equations.
