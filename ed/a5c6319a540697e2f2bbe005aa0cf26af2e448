I got a whole different perspective on that Snake Oil thing after reading
"A Quarter Century of UNIX" by Peter Salus.  According to Armando Stettner
(DEC Ultrix Architect) Ken Olsen meant, "Much the way people were peddling
snake oil a century ago, now every vendor is hyping Unix as a cure for
everything".  He was only making a analogy but the statement was "taken
out of context".  Anyway, the book has been enjoyable.

Mike
P.S. Where is Armando now?  Is he still doing Unix stuff?

I think you'd have to consider a reboot to be a failure.  Steveen
could say better than I, but I'd expect 2.9BSD to have told you why it
died.  2.11BSD certainly does.

	Well, it tries its darndest to do so.  If the system gets its
	knickers sufficiently twisted I've seen it hang part way thru
	printing the panic message.  'course then there are the self
	inflicted crashes where an errant driver scribbles all over memory,
	in which case you may not get a meaningful indication of what
	went wrong ;)

I have only one things to say to you guys; TECO.
(And besides, EMACS is just a bunch of macros for TECO, GNU-EMACS don't
even count... ;-)

Yes, and it was almost 2 years between reboots.  Otherwise, they were
rather rare, and I can't remember why.  I have all the console logs
around somewhere under a pile, and if/when I uncover them, I'll look
through them to see what happened.  Maybe I'll suddenly report it here
in 6 months--after my next reboot, err, cleanup.

Yeah, what kind of sadistic, malicious bastards would create a *free*
version of unix, then port it to nearly every platform imaginable!!?!?
What could have been going through their twisted minds?
