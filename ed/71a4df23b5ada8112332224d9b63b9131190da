Can't you make a switch statement do what you need there? 

The two things I really missed were:

- BCPL's ValOf/ResultIs, for making more complex macros (although with the
	latest modern compilers, which inline small functions, this is less
	of an issue)
- The ability to 'break' out of more than one level of nesting; one either
	has to stand on one's head (code-wise), or use a goto
