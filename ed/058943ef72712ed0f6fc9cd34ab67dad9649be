    Thanks for that.

    This reminded me that the Thompson shell used goto for flow control, =
which
    I had forgotten.

    Bourne commented on the omission of goto from the Bourne shell, "I
    eliminated goto in favour of flow control primitives like if and for.=

    This was also considered rather radical departure from the existing
    practice."

    Was this decision contentious at all?  Was there a specific reason fo=
r
    goto's exclusion in the Bourne shell?


    Thanks.

At the time it may have raised a few eyebrows but I don't recall much dis=
cussion about it then.  My email tracks at the time don't mention it.
Doug McIlroy or Steve Johnson (or Ken) on this forum might recall differe=
ntly.  At the time scripts were not that complicated and so error recover=
y to a far off place in the script was not common.  As an aside I did per=
suade Dennis to add "setjmp" and "longjmp" so the shell code itself could=
 recover from some kinds of script errors.
So I did not have a "religious" aversion to "goto" at the time.

Steve
