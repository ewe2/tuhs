I get the impression that you seem to think that I think that what Unix 
was around the time of BSD 4.3 was sufficient.  -  I'm not making that 
claim or even thinking it.

I'm talking about the spirit, as in "do one thing and do it well".  Not 
that e.g. syslog shall be these specific facilities and these specific 
severrities.

I want people to understand what was done, why it was done, and to the 
best of their ability, make an informed decision when changing from 
history.  -  I'd really like people to be able to answer the question 
"Why did you do <bla> differently than it was done in <blaBlaBla>.  What 
was wrong / lacking / needed to be improved from the old way."

As long as people 1) have answers to those questions and 2) can speak to 
why they did what they did, then by all means, move forward with 
something new to try.

I hear tell of people putting reverse proxies in containers in front of 
web server containers so that they can have basic traffic counters, 
which they can't get (for some unknown to me reason) from their web 
server container.  -  Where if they had bothered to ask the network 
people, there are very likely multiple ways to get said traffic 
counters.  Further, ways to do it without adding the additional 
complexity (read: exposure) / latency of additional containers.
