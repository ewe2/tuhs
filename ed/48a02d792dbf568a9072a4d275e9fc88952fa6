Subject: [TUHS] old Software Tools VOS, anyone?
Message-ID: <200311291909.hATJ9VSk021709@skeeve.com>

Greetings all.

Does anyone have any of the old Software Tools Virtual Operating System
code?  I know someone who is looking for it.   On a related topic, if
anyone has a copy of the Georgia Tech Software Tools Subsystem for Pr1me
Computers, the same person would like a copy (as would I --- I was one
of the two people who did the last two releases of it).

Thanks,

Arnold Robbins
