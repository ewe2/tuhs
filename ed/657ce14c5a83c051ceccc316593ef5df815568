Uuencode was very basic.  It could be used for what later was called 
"attachments", but it couldn't handle rich text message bodies, multiple 
attachments, and it had security issues and UNIX-specific content.  The 
coolness factor of Borenstein's original "let me sing you email" was all 
it took to get us hooked.
