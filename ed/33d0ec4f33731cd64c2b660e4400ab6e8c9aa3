Just stirring up the gene pool, so to speak...  And who hasn't played 
chess with a computer, and caught it cheating?

You know, the current version of the SIMH emulator can connect to
serial ports now. If you want I can help you setup SIMH's PDP-11
simulator running a PDP-11 UNIX which of course has chess you play. So
that it'll work on your TTY.

Only required information is: "What serial port is your Teletype's
current loop adapter connected?" and "What do you want to run? V6, V7,
Ultrix-11, RT-11 (V4, V5.3, V5.7), RSTS/E (V7, V10.1-L), RSX-11/M+,
DSM-11 (kill it with fire)? All of the above?"


Cheers,
Christian
