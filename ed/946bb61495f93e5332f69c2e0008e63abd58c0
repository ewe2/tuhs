Charlie may be able to add commentary on that but it was almost =

>=20

I initially missed Kevin's ping after my spam filter put several TUHS =
messages in /var/mail/devnull. (I eventually skim subject lines of =
messages that go there.)

I could write more than I want to/should about how the VRM came to be =
and not to be, but will try to add a little to what I've said before =
(https://notes.technologists.com/notes/2017/03/08/lets-start-at-the-very-b=
eginning-801-romp-rtpc-aix-versions/). I'm trusting 30+ year-old =
memories here and not looking at the various papers and manuals that =
might inform.

I joined Glenn's AFWS project July 5, 1982. There was no well defined =
software plan yet. Glenn wanted to do something useful and significant, =
and proposed that we do the VRM. We had several distinct user =
environments in mind. I took the lead in writing a specification of the =
VMI (virtual machine interface) while others started prototyping. We =
were way overly ambitious with abstractions along the lines of the =
single level store of (Glenn's) System 38, trying to take advantage of =
the 40 bit addressing of the Rosetta virtual memory chip, yet still =
heavily influenced by CP/CMS. After a few months, Al Chang, primary =
person behind CP.R, came to Austin for a design review of what we'd =
done. He told Glenn he'd grade our work "C+". That might have been =
generous.=20

We scaled back our ambitions dramatically, started working with ISC. =
About the time (1983) of the transition from "ad tech" to "product" =
organization, it became clear that our virtual memory manager needed to =
be scrapped and we lifted what Al had done for CP.R and put it in the =
VRM.

In hindsight, the VRM turned out better than it might have. Besides AIX =
there was a version of Pick for VRM that sold about 4000 copies =
according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RT_PC. Though the VMI =
cost us some in performance, we were surprisingly successful in =
minimizing the penalties. But with AIX 3 and RS/6000 we wanted to take =
dramatic steps forward, and it made no sense to preserve the VMI.

Anecdotal comments on other TUHS/COFF discussions:

If I recall correctly, pcc, eventually including the HCR optimizing =
phase, was bundled with base AIX. Initially, the C compiler based on the =
PL.8 compiler would only run on CMS, so it was not generally available =
outside of IBM, but app vendors, especially CAD vendors, were enabled =
and encouraged to come to Austin to use it to get the best performance. =
The native C compiler based on PL.8 compiler concepts ended up being a =
complete rewrite, outside of Yorktown, and sold as a separate product.

Producing software products, getting them released, priced, etc. was =
very confusing to me most of the time I was at IBM. Part of it was the =
history that Clem has cited. Part of it was confusion about the =
antitrust suits against IBM. Part of it was confusion about whether and =
what software was patentable. Academics and others wanted access to the =
modeling & simulation software, RESQ, my team developed at Yorktown. =
Eventually, the concept of "Research Distributed Program" was agreed =
upon and RESQ was the first instance: =
https://technologists.com/sauer/RA144.pdf. However, we were forced to =
price RESQ much higher than I thought reasonable. I had already =
transferred to Austin by the time the release was official -- I don't =
know how many copies were sold. But source code was necessary to take =
full advantage of RESQ so the PL/I source was included on the tapes.

When OSF was announced, with the intention of making AIX source =
available to the other OSF companies, I was stunned because it was so =
uncharacteristic of the IBM I thought I knew. It would be interesting to =
know how that would have worked out if OSF had stuck with AIX and IBM =
had delivered the source on the schedule everyone hoped for, but that's =
on a different timeline than this one.=20
