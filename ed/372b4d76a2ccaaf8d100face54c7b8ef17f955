Hmm. Clem has a far richer recollection than I do. I don't recall Dan's 
version, but I defer to Clem.

I do have a vague recollection of a program called cr3 intended to mimic 
the tty driver thing. Perhaps that was Dan's version.

I note that my 4.1BSD manual more(1) says the author is "Eric 
Shienbrood, minor revisions by John Foderaro and Geoffrey Peck."
