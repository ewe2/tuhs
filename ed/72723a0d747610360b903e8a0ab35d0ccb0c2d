Subject: [pups] Boot_Images and the networking activated version of Simh
Message-ID: <001b01c2975d$79b12380$d167580c@who>

Hello from Gregg C Levine
Just out of curiosity, can the boot images stored in the folders that
are under that name, actually support this new version of Simh? That is
the PDP-11 emulator. What would be necessary to enable that function? It
looks as if one of them, is aware of the device, since I believe the
image was made on a machine which has the appropriate card installed in
it, but after that I'm lost.
