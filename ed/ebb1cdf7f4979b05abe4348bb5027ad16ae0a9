I had thought of that. I'm not sure I want to write a terminal emulator :)
I guess I should ask those people with tapeless PDP-11s.

If you had a method of booting and installing disk images over a serial
line, would you be happy with a serial line to a `tape server' separate
to your console line, or would you rather have the two combined?

I don't have a PDP-11, but I have done work in various ways with
remote-device installs.  If it were me I would prefer to be able
to use a device distinct from the console, for several reasons:
- a separate device might have an input silo (e.g. the DZ11 does);
the console usually doesn't.  A silo offers a little more robustness
and may allow greater speeds.
- it is better to keep the console available as a place for error
messages to show up when things go wrong.
- things are going to go wrong in any case, and I am going to have
to try booting several times.  If I have to get a serial-line switch
or move cables back and forth, that is another thing that can go
wrong, and another thing I can screw up.

On the other hand, if I had the problem I would likely be happy to
get any code that would help, whichever way it worked.  So I also
favour letting the implementor choose.

That's why I've inquired of Warren about using the DZ-11 as the
pseudo-device.  I also have a console input (DL-11, from memory).  The input
silo is potentially a benefit, but it's not a panacea by any means -- it has
to be handled pretty carefully.  -- isk

The FreeBSD documentation project doesn't deal with 4.3BSD, nor with
Vaxen.   Check the UNIX Heritage Society at
http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/TUHS for details of 4.3BSD and how you
can get it for the Vax.

Done! See http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/Vtserver and 
http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/Vtserver/vtserver/vtreadme.html
for details.

At the present I have Ersatz-2.0 running as a PDP-11/34A, one RK05 and
just the console. I have my tape server connected to the serial console
line, and I'm bringing in an RK05 disk image:

Virtual tape server, $Revision: 2.0 $ 
Running command stty -f /dev/ttyid1 9600 cs8 clocal -crtscts

Tape records are:
   0 tinyboot
   1 copy
   2 root.img

So no need for DZ-11, but many thanks to Norman, John and others who

Now that I (think I) have got a working system of loading a bootable
disk image over a serial line into a PDP-11/34, can someone create
a suitable disk image? I'm away until Feb 14th and won't be able to do it.

The requestor is Ian King <iking at microsoft.com>, who says:

  I've recently acquired a working PDP-11/34, with RK05s.  (I also have some
  Plessey DD 11/80s for it.) My 11/34 is mapped, with 124k
  available; I also have another memory card with 128k on it, and if I can
  ever find any documentation on the Plessey memory cards and the memory
  management switch settings, I may have 252k one of these days.  :-)
  I have only one DL/KL-11, but also a DZ11.

He'd like a 6th Edition bootable RK05 disk image that he can download
onto his real disk.

Many thanks all!

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Sender: owner-pups at minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au

Hi,

I have got 2.11 BSD (from the rp_unknown disk) up and working on the
Supnik 2.3+BB1 simulator, configured as follows:

set cpu 22b
set cpu 2048K
at rp0 mydisks/2.11BSD/2.11_rp_unknown
boot rp

While tinkering with the date2.c program posted earlier by Alex
Chupakhin, which now runs on 2.11 BSD btw, I discovered the following:

- 'cc -o date2 date2.c' works fine, producing a 12K binary

- a makefile containing this command fails - the compilation starts but
fails silently, producing a 2K binary that is not marked executable. 
The makefile is:

   date2: date2.c
           cc -o date2 -c date2.c 

- 'make -n | sh' fails in the same way

Is this a known problem that will be fixed by patches (none applied yet
as the simulator is not networked)?  Or do I need to provide more
memory?

Some other info:

# uname -a
2.11BSD whistler-2bsd 2.11BSD 2.11 BSD UNIX #11: Tue Jan 6 16:57:02 MET
1998
     root at pdp11.begemot.com:/usr/src/sys/HIPPON  PDP11

By the way, if anyone else has 2.11 BSD in unpatched state and wants to
set the date to 2001, email me for a copy of the 
updated date2.c program.

Apart from this problem, 2.11BSD is working very nicely - I'm impressed
that such a feature-rich Unix can even be run on a PDP-11!

Cheers,

Richard

Well, the terminal emulator doesn't have to be very sophisticated as
once the thing was running properly then you would use what ever the PC
system had installed.

The "two separate" would probably be easier to create but it occurs to
me that many PCs only have one serial line and the only serial line that
is common to all 11s is the console therefore only needing a single
driver.

In fact, if someone has RK05s and isn't too far away, I'd love to get a
bootable image on an RK05 cartridge -- of course I'd pay postage both ways.
(I even have some original shipping boxes.)  

BTW, the mail Warren cites below was sent before I had really dug into my
11/34's manuals; I have 124kW of MOS memory in the machine, and RSX-11M can
use it all in a "mapped" configuration.  Also, if I am going to transfer a
disk image, I have another DL-11 I am going to install to make use of
Warren's VTServer program.  

TIA -- Ian

Subject: [pups] A bootable disk image for a PDP-11/34?


Now that I (think I) have got a working system of loading a bootable
disk image over a serial line into a PDP-11/34, can someone create
a suitable disk image? I'm away until Feb 14th and won't be able to do it.

The requestor is Ian King <iking at microsoft.com>, who says:

  I've recently acquired a working PDP-11/34, with RK05s.  (I also have some
  Plessey DD 11/80s for it.) My 11/34 is mapped, with 124k
  available; I also have another memory card with 128k on it, and if I can
  ever find any documentation on the Plessey memory cards and the memory
  management switch settings, I may have 252k one of these days.  :-)
  I have only one DL/KL-11, but also a DZ11.

He'd like a 6th Edition bootable RK05 disk image that he can download
onto his real disk.

Many thanks all!

	Warren

Remove the -c flag, it tells the compiler to only compile the program
and not produce an executable.

Just from the historical point of view, note that the first major
file on a genuine 6th Edition distribution tape _is_ a bootable
RK05 image.  Something like 4000 blocks.

I'll second that.  The V6 tape image I provided to PUPS has the
usual boot blocks at the start of the tape then as I recall three
RJ05 disk images.  Long long ago I think I got folks interested in
using emulators like Bob Supnik's by using the first tape disk image
as the "disk" image for "sim" and booted V6... but it has been more
than 6 years now since I did that and I may be rusty on details.
