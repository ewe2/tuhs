On January 29, 1944 J. Presper Eckert wrote a memo explaining how
information could be stored on spinning disks, using one large memory to
hold intermediate results, lookup tables, and program information.  This
was several months before von Neumann joined the project.  See A History of
Computing in the Twentieth Century (1980).

von Neumann did a good job of writing up the idea, but it would have
happened without him.
