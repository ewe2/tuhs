Hello again from Gregg C Levine
Going to the website you suggested www.arcind.net brought up an
interesting collection of boards, the ones made by Data Translation:

Data Translation:
1 - DT2762-DI
1 - DT2762-SE
1 - DT2762-SE-PG

At first glance I believe them to be the usual items that DT was
making for DEC systems until whenever they decided to EOL the whole
product line. DT, not DEC. Can any of you, ID them? Oh, and Jonathan,
I've sent an e-mail off to the company requesting a quote.

Wait,
