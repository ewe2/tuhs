This appears to be one of a number of sites that have decided to flaunt the
law.  They decide, arbitrarily and with no real legal basis, that "if
something is older than x arbitrary date, it must be OK to distribute," or
"if something is for an operating system that no one really uses, it must
be OK to distribute."  Why they do not get shut down is a mystery to me.  I
believe the concept started with old games for DOS and has spread to
include operating systems and other software.
