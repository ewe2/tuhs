Tuxedo, the database??  FML buffers, etc..  That Tuxedo???

If so, Ya, the system I worked on when I was at AT&T / Lucent in the
mid-90's to early 2000s used it.  The product was a traffic management
system called NTMOS or NetMinder/NTM.  We had the source code to the
version of Tuxedo used by the product, and ran it on the Vax initially
and then ported it to the Mips based Star servers [Tandems], i386 based
NCR systems, probably the Sun Sparc at some point, and lastly the HPs.
