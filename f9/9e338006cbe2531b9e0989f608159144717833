Has FreeBSD lost the ability to do unattended PXE installs?  Certainly 
this capability was there in the old sysinstall installer, and I used it 
extensively back in the FreeBSD-3 through FreeBSD-6 days.


My personal preference is still for FreeBSD, and it's what I use on my 
personal desktops, laptops, and most servers.


Most of my professional experience has been with Redhat Linux.  During the 
dot-com era, I found Linux to be disappointing (relative to BSD), but it's 
obviously caught up by this point, and I think it's a fine choice.


I tried hard to like Mac OSX.  On paper, it seemed like the ideal thing: a 
real unix kernel (well, sort of...) married to a "real" UI.  But in 
practice, I've found it hugely disappointing.  My main complaint is that 
the interfaces have been so unstable.  "It's just unix; you configure it 
by just editing files!  Oh, except that we decided to switch all the apps 
to reading this NetInfo database, we just left the flat files in /etc 
for... reasons... but all shipped software ignores them.  Wait, did I say 
NetInfo?  I meant OpenDirectory."  It felt like important interfaces were 
changing practically with every version, and not updating was, of course, 
not an option.

And then there was the whole Darwin v. OpenDarwin debacle and the 
basically fake approach to being open source.

It eventually became clear to me that Apple's intention was that users 
should never look under the hood nor tinker with the system.  And since 
looking under the hood and tinkering are kind of _sine qua non_ for me for 
an operating system, I stopped using it.
