* Install /usr/ports/net-im/jitsi.  (Comment out the BROKEN line from the 
Makefile and "make install" should work as usual; the source can actually 
be fetched just fine...)

* kldload cuse

* Run firefox and surf to that URL.

After doing this, I surfed to that URL and was connected, with the video 
from my webcam displaying in the browser.

     hashbrown/home/jason-124575: uname -a
     FreeBSD hashbrown 12.1-STABLE FreeBSD 12.1-STABLE r357056 JKERN12  amd64

For what it's worth, the webcam identifies itself as vendor:product 
0x046d:0x0825, which, according to https://wiki.freebsd.org/WebcamCompat 
is a Logitech C270 HD.  I think I paid about $20 USD for it, five or so 
years ago.  The quality is quite sufficient for video conferencing, and it 
works with webcamd, vlc, and all the other software that I typically run 
on my FreeBSD desktop.  As always, YMMV...
