Good to know you think it was possible.   I know in the case of Ultrix and
HP-UX lots of external folks licenses small things like Mentat, MIPS etc.
 For instance, one of the Ultrix and Alpha bug-a-boos was the MIPS
compiler, which leaked into the IP stream along the way.    As far as I
remember from my Locus days when we had just about everybody's sources from
IBM to Sun, the problem was the license was not just the OEM and AT&T,
there was always the sub-licenses from some deal or another that the OEM
had cut at some point.
