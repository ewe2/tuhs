BTW: another old V6 trick is the use file redirection from the different
terminal to unlock a hosed tty.  Programming on the console was
fraught with multiple dragons and not recommended.  But due to program
crashes that left things in raw mode, I admit that I remember having to
uses the redirection trick a few times to get the console back.  As Noel
said, it could get dicey if the console ended up with canonicalization
turned off.   V7's =C2=BD cooked (*a.k.a.* CBREAK) was a welcomed edition, =
but
the fact is V6's try handler was good enough most needs and a lot of used
it pretty successfully for a long time.
