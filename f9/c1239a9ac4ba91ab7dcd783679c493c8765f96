No, as far as I know, Multics was always 'old-style' - the directory contained
not just the name of the file, but also all the file's meta-data. Multics had
only symbolic links, I'm pretty sure.

To answer the original question, I can't think offhand of another system that
separated naming and file meta-data before Unix did it. I've always assumed
that that was one of Unix' novel ideas.
