I call it automiscorrect. First, it is very easy to mistype on these touch b=
ased interfaces and then they miscorrect using too large a vocabulary.

At USC, back when I was a student, they started us off with PL/C, a subset o=
f PL/I. The PL/C compiler tried its level best to make sense of the student p=
rograms it was given, with error messages such as =E2=80=9CPL/C uses ....=E2=
=80=9D. This was confusing to many students as they would do exactly what PL=
/C said it used and yet their program didn=E2=80=99t work.
