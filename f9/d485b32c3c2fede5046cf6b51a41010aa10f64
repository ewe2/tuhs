There's no way that I'd use ZFS; lose a block in an ordinary file, well, 
you now have a hole (but not in the file-system sense); lose a block in a 
compressed system, well...

Or perhaps I'm becoming conservative in my old age; I remember when I once 
rewrote utilities that when writing a zero block merely did a seek instead 
(or something like that; you had to remember to actually write out the 
last block).  I wouldn't try it these days, as Unix file systems were 
simple back then.

Well, I did (but without ZFS) on several boxes, with zero help.  Having
had SunOS experience (4.4 was the best) helped :-)

I can't stand Penguin/OS; it looks too much like Windoze for my liking
(and does its best to be almost-Unix-but-not-quite).
