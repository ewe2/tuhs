Subject: [pups] UNIX "time-line"
Message-ID: <OF1722E6EC.88E14DF8-ON80256AFD.0032AAC6@unixware.org.uk>

Hi guys,

I'm working on a UNIX time-line database.
Its pretty basic atm - I've yet to hunt down the majority of SysV vendors 
out there.

I'm currently looking for early releases, and V6/V7 offshoots (such as 
PWB).
The data I'm looking for is vendor, strain, version, and date of release 
(such as AIX, version 4.3.2, released 05/10/1998, SVR4, IBM etc)

Does anyone know of any sites that would give that kind of information for 
the V6/V7 and earlier releases?

The database is currently at http://www.unixware.org.uk/test.php.  There 
isn't much to look at atm, I've yet to code the PHP interface, thought it 
would be best to complete the database first though :-)

I'm hoping that, one day, it will contain a complete listing of all UNIX 
releases, clones, and offshoots... well, I can dream ;-)

Regards,
Paul.
