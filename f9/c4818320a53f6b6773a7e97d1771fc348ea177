At this point, I am at the simh prompt (">"). I think simh catches
the halt instruction and goes to the simh prompt when it encounters
one. I have a VAX 4000/300 at home (unfortunately it doesn't run
any of the older unixes), and when it halts, I get the >>> prompt
(differs from simh).

I am pretty sure that I have configured simh correctly, I verified
this by installing netbsd on the same setup, and it boots ok.

My only problem seems to be getting the bootblocks right. I have
heard that someone managed to install quasijarus0a on simh, so it
must be me somehow screwing the bootblocks.

the problem is with the bootloader only, quasijarus0a runs well once booted using
the netbsd bootloader.

>I would agree. What other system can you boot on SIMH?
only netbsd and quasijarus0a (I don't have any vms media).

thanks for your help
