And I've received the documents!  This is a pastebin with the rough content=
s of the documentation package.

https://pastebin.com/jAqqBXA4

Now for some analysis:

The User's Manual is branded System V but also displays a Western Electric =
Bell logo.  I've seen Release 5.0 manuals displaying the Bell logo and Syst=
em V manuals without, but never a System V with.  That implies the publicat=
ion of the manual had to change a few times, one to switch from internal Re=
lease 5.0 to commercial System V and another time to remove the Bell logo d=
ue to divestiture.  I would have to wonder if similar transition can be see=
n with different revisions of these documents?

The Release Description manual has a list of System V relevant documents an=
d they all appear to be accounted for here, so this should represent the we=
alth of documentation available to a user of System V Gold in 1983.

Most documents are traceable to documents in the Unix 4.0 collection.  I've=
 suffixed various documents here with the coordinate to the same in the 4.0=
 collection.  Changes of note:

- The System V documentation includes instructions for 3B20S machines as we=
ll as the instructions for DEC equipment.  PDP-11 and VAX guidance have bee=
n combined into a single document.

- The System V documentation adds documents concerning an "Auto Call" featu=
re.  Didn't see this anywhere in 4.0, so should be new circa System V.

- This documentation refers to the last version as System III rather than m=
aking any mention of 4.0.  Given that the specific documents mentioning thi=
s are System V-branded, and there are comparable documents that are Release=
 5.0 branded, this implies there may be a document floating around out ther=
e somewhere equivalent to the Release Description manual but that actually =
covers the transition from 4.0 to 5.0.

- The documentation package drops the updated CACM paper, likely because it=
's available all sorts of other places.

- The summary and documentation roadmap documents appear to have been synth=
esized and combined into the Release Description.

- Snyder and Mashey's shell tutorial was either dropped or combined with Bo=
urne's shell introduction

- No evidence of an MM foldout like was distributed with 4.0 (and before, t=
here are sources around implying these foldouts started with the PWB group,=
 may have been printed as early as 1977)

- Either the original EQN paper is dropped or relevant bits mashed together=
 with the user's guide

- EFL documentation seems to be dropped, or is merged into one of the other=
 Fortran documents somewhere down in there.  The processor is still in the =
man pages though.

- ADB documentation seems to be dropped, likewise still in the manuals, lis=
ted as DEC only.  Since System V seems to treat DEC as PDP-11+VAX, does thi=
s imply there was a VAX ADB?  My understanding is SDB started on 32V and wa=
s *the* debugger for VAX.

- Unix Virtual Protocol papers are dropped, they were marked as 3.0 only in=
 the 4.0 manuals anyhow, so probably not relevant.

- The Standalone I/O Library and SASH (Shell) paper is dropped

- None of the internals nor security papers seem to have made it, so no Uni=
x Implemention, I/O Implementation, PDP and Portable C Compiler Tours, Asse=
mbler Manual, PDP-11/23 and 11/34, or Password Security papers.

These will likely be a slower burn than the 4.0 documents since I purchased=
 them myself and am not in a hurry to get them shipped back to someone.  Th=
at said, if there's anything in the above pastebin that particularly piques=
 any interest, I can try to move those to the top of the stack and get scan=
s done sooner rather than later.  I'll also be doing some analysis between =
these and the 4.0 docs to try and better determine authorship of various do=
cuments, my hope is to have a pretty clear picture of whos work went into e=
ach manual by the time I'm done with it all.
