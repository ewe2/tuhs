I was able to get it to format with groff/refer on my OS X 10.11.6 
system (groff 1.19.2) with a single edit to cstr100, changing the path 
to cprog.mac in line 5 to './cprog.mac'.  It produced a few warnings, 
but produced what seems to be reasonable output:

$ refer < cstr100 | groff -Tps -ms | ps2pdf - cstr100.pdf
refer:<standard input>:70: no matches for `kernighan plauger software 
tools addison'
refer:<standard input>:112: no matches for `jensen wirth pascal report 
1978'
refer:<standard input>:141: no matches for `habermann pascal critical'
refer:<standard input>:1531: found `$LIST$' but not accumulating 
references
<standard input>:10: warning: can't find font `B'
<standard input>:12: warning: can't find font `I'
<standard input>:14: warning: can't find font `R'

The errors in the refer output seem to be legit problems in the source 
file.  I've not been able to figure out what's going on with the font 
errors, those lines seem OK to me, but my (g|t)roff is rusty.

A little bit of searching on Google let me fill in the missing bits for 
refer, but I still haven't fixed the font warnings.
