Doors are a backport from the "Spring" operating system from Bill Joy that he 
developed in Colorado after the SVr4 task was finished around 1992.

Spring was send to universities and research institutes in 1996 and then shut 
down, but doors were backported to Solaris for "nscd" the name service cache 
daemon.
