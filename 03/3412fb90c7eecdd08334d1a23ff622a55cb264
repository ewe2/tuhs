This is not a really TUHS topic.  As one of those people who does not have
decent internet service and am still waiting I'd be happy to see some money
spent to broaden availability.  This is not being a matter of waiting years,
it's a matter of waiting decades so far.  Access is an equity issue as it's
essential for everything from participating in government, schooling, and
almost every other aspect of life today.  Maybe people with good service are
willing to have everyone else wait but IMHO society isn't well served that way.
