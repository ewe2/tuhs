OpenSolaris is derived from SVR4 and much of the userland stuff is
still quite similar to the original release. Sadly, System V as a
whole is still regarded as a commercial product and no source is
available. If you want the source code for a decent early-90s Unix
implementation, I'd take a look at 4.4BSD. It's not SVR4, but it's
from the same era and has many of the same abilities.
