Kirk was there the whole time, from far earlier until the end of the
CSRG.  Sokolov came later, and to my recollection he wasn't involved
in core BSD at all.  I don't have any personal recollections of the
time, but it seems clear who is more plausible.

Clearly this is beyond what is on the 4 CD set, right?  That tree
contains a file TAPE with the comments (inter alia)

  Extracted from two 4.1BSD distribution tapes dated 7/10/81.

  First label on the tape:

	4.1bsd VAX UNIX System 7/10/81

	5 files on tape:
	1 (boot stuff) 2 (root dump)
	3 (/usr) 4 (/usr/src) 5(4.0/4.1)
	last three are tar; 1600 bpi

But presumably you know that.  Was this the Haertel reconstruction you
mention?

BSDI came later, and the founders weren't CSRG people, though some
CSRG people did join the company.  I think the real issue was that
CSRG no longer had a purpose: the research aspect was over and done
with, and the funding dried up.
