Hey Rob,

I followed Bell Labs through the papers, the Lions doc, but I didn't get
any insight into Research after v7 or so.

Can you tell us what you liked about the later versions?

I don't want to be a total suck up but I've been a fan of your insight
ever since you said something like "if you think you need threads your
processes are too fat".  I've had long discussions with Linus about how
to make that statement 100% true (partial page table sharing across
processes, how do you make that work in general).  We didn't come to
an answer but we both agreed that processes should be as cheap as 
threads and mmap is the way to share data.
