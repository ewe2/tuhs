We could set up a web site

	inmemoriamdmr.org

	maybe initially as a wiki and ask people to add their contribution
and then maybe we could try to collect there his works or add a blog with
articles about him that could be commented...

	Just an idea, I am in the middle of a Congress, seated in the front
row and trying to listen to speakers through my consternation, and can do
very little now.
