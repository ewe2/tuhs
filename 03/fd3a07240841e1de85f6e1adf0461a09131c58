Thanks.  Provided you had a 387 as well, a 386 should be OK.  The
486 has some useful cache instructions like "invd" and "invlpg",
but it was the lack of builtin floating point I was thinking of.

Others have already responded about the 286/8086, so I'll only say
the port IS very 32-bit, and it would be hard to change that.
