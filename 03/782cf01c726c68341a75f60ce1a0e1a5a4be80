I've imported fs/root and fs/usr into the svn repository with the files from
the s2 tape, and fs/new has Tim's etc/init so far. I haven't written any
scripts to make filesystem images yet.

Rather than use the file owner/permissions on the fs/ files, I'll modify
mkfs.c to read a table a la the rawperms table in tools/mktape.py, so that
the exact owner/perms get put into the V1 filesystem images.

Cheers,
