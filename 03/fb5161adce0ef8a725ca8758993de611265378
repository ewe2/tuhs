I'm very hazy on the details, because I wasn't directly involved, but we 
had shared libraries in AIX for the RT starting with the initial release 
in 1986 (based on SVR1). Larry Loucks did most of the design, with help 
from ISC folks and maybe Rick Simpson. Larry mentions this work in our 
AIX 2 paper 
(https://technologists.com/sauer/Advanced%20Interactive%20Executive%20(AIX)%20Operating%20System%20Overview.pdf) 
but I don't see any useful description, nor do I see anything useful 
skimming http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/pc/rt/ docs. A more 
sophisticated shared library design was one of the additions in AIX 3.

P.S. That paper and 
https://technologists.com/sauer/SA23-1057_IBM_RT_Personal_Computer_Technology_1986.pdf 
do include a bit more discussion of our memory mapped files since 
support for those was a primary goal of the 801 virtual memory design 
(summarized in the "Rosetta" paragraph of 
https://notes.technologists.com/notes/2017/03/08/lets-start-at-the-very-beginning-801-romp-rtpc-aix-versions/).
