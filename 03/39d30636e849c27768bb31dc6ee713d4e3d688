K&R 1 did not have void or structure assignment. Those came later,
although I'm not sure when.  They may have been mentioned in an
appendix; my copy isn't handy to check.

At what point did each struct become its own namespace? I think
around the time of K&R1.

The troff rewrite was later, circa '81 or so. Definitely NOT in the
V6/V7 timeframe.
