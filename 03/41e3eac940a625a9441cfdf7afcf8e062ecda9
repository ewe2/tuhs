Thanks! That was a very interesting read.

As a general remark, the historical discussions here of late have been
very interesting (if voluminous :-).  I think it's increasingly important
to preserve as much of this history as possible.  I've enjoyed reading
about some of the systems I never worked on, such as ITS.
