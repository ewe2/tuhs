I had a similar issue with BSD 2.11.
So, I hope this helps.

You can use vt100.   However, make sure your baud rate is 9600.

stty 9600

(SIMH makes the virtual adjustment so you don't need to worry about SIMH settings.)

I am using BSD 2.11 on a Mac with SIMH.  I noticed the console port would have a short window.   But, logging into dz ports were fine.   Setting the console baud rate to match the dz11 settings fixed the issue.

So, I suspect either a setting in vi that changes the window size on slow devices or it's hard coded somewhere.  I will take a look.

Truly,

Bill Corcoran

What should I set TERM to on V8 to get the best results on my Mac Terminal. If I set it to vt52, vt100, or vt132, only 8 lines appear at the bottom of the terminal window (of about 24 lines):

The 8 line window works about like I'd expect - the arrow keys move up and down until the screen needs to scroll, then B's and A's show up. I'm used to that on BSD. Using the j and k keys work better and when I scroll down enough lines, the lines move up to fill the whole terminal window and the file can be edited in the full window. Is there a better TERM setting that will get 24 lines to show up on file open?

Thanks,

Will
