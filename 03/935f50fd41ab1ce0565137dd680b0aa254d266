The status is as follows.  Feel free to relay onto the various newsgoups
and lists; I obviously lack the time to :)

- VTserver runs on my VAX (Ultrix-32 V4.4 and V4.5)
- Client code is now in Ultrix-11 V3.1

I can get VTserver to upload the primary boot loader to the PDP-11 (I test
with two.. a MicroPDP-11/23 and a MicroPDP-11/53) and that in turn makes
the box load the Boot: program.

When that is loaded, I can go two ways:

- type "install" and Boot: will load the RAM disk from the server, and
  switch to that.  Works.

- manually load and run programs.  Works.

The problem here, is, that Ultrix uses a very complicated memory setup,
which forces some MMU fiddling into all the drivers.  Warren's driver was
done for BSD and V7, which do not have this "problem".

I am now adding this MMU support to the driver, and that's the end of it..
all other parts work fine.

Here is a test run log.  Falafel is the VAX 3100.  My VTserver program
uploads the boot code to the (Micro-)PDP-11 if the "-o" option is given.

The other commands work similarly.  I only need to revamp the MMU stuff,
and then I'm done and we can boot/install Ultrix-11 from VT !

As of today, it is WORKING !
I just finished a (slooooow :) system load onto a MicroPDP-11/23.  Works
like a charm.. just takes a while.  Here is a log:

That's where the parity stuff bites us (see the dicussion regarding
2.11BSD :) but I'll fix that later.. its a make-up change, trivial.

Let's continue with Kermit:

Type the escape character followed by C to get back,

This program performs operating system setup functions during
installation and normal system operation. Setup operates in one
of three possible modes (phases), depending on the current state
of the system. The three modes are:

 Phase 1: Initial setup -- prepares system for first sysgen.
 Phase 2: Final setup -- completes the system setup.
 Phase 3: Change setup -- handles system setup changes.

The program will ask several setup questions. Enter your answer
to each question, using lowercase characters, then press <RETURN>.

The questions include helpful hints enclosed in angle brackets < >
and/or parenthesis ( ). If you need additional help answering any
question, enter a ? or the word help then press <RETURN>.

You can correct typing mistakes by pressing the <DELETE> key to
erase a single character or <CTRL/U> to erase the entire line.
You can interrupt the setup program by typing <CTRL/C>. This
allows you to abort the setup process or restart it.

Press <RETURN> to continue:

PLEASE CONFIRM: console is a VIDEO terminal <y or n> ? y

****** READING SETUP DATA FROM setup.info FILE ******

(vt(0,0)boot) - bad load device!


The initial setup program cannot obtain the information it needs
to complete the installation from the setup.info file. The sdload
program writes this information into the setup.info file after
loading the software onto the system disk. For some unknown reason
the setup program cannot access the information.

You can supply the missing information or abort the installation.
If you continue, the program will prompt you for the following:

    o  Setup phase number

    o  System disk type

    o  Target processor type

    o  Software load device type


Continue the installation <y or n> ? n


****** INITIAL SETUP ABORTED ******

You have the following options:

    o  Restart the installation procedure at the beginning.

    o  Execute the following steps to retry the initial setup:

           Halt the processor.
           Execute the hardware bootstrap for the system disk.
           The setup program should restart automatically, if
           it does not, execute: cd /.setup; setup.

    o  Contact the Telephone Support Center or your local DIGITAL
       software services office for assistance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

and that's where it currently ends.

I did already upgrade the root file system dump (hey.. I knew it was
working once it started load that one.. :) so the kernel is already up
to spec.  I also have updated versions of /etc/rdate and /bin/date on
it, so we can install using this era, and not go back to the early 70s :)

Problems to be fixed:

- icky parity stuff in VTserver (terminal mode) .. there are more problems
  with it.  I think the receive buffer can overflow if we are in the main
  server_loop() routine... causing us to loose characters on input.

- no kernel support for the VT device, so, past the initial load, we're
  still fucked, so to speak.  In other words.. Warren, sweetie.. should
  we change our priorities and do the kernel driver first, and THEN redo
  the protocol as discussed last night?

Cheers,
	Fred (**yawn** - 109 straight hours of coding :)
