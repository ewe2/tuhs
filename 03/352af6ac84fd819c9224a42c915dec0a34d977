Sure. It's worth reading the entire V6 manual if you're going to be doing a
lot with it - lots of goodies hidden in places like that. Also the two BSTJ
Unix issues. (I think they are available online, now.)

That's really a SIMH question, and I don't use SIMH; I use Ersatz11. That is
certainly how Ersatz11 works; I just FTP'd the RK05 distro images over, set
them up as the files that 'implemented' various RK05 drives, and (modulo a
few teething Ersatz11 configuration issues) away it went.
