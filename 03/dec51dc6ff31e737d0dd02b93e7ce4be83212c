Yes.  See the following transcript of a session.  I created a small
script named "bad" which just does "date" to show that it worked.

iota: try 1107$ ls -l bad
-rwxrwxr-x  1 cdl cdl 16 Aug 12 15:56 bad*
iota: try 1108$ /bin/sh bad

iota: try 1109$ ./bad
: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
iota: try 1110$ cat bad
#!/bin/sh
date
iota: try 1111$ od -c bad
0000000   #   !   /   b   i   n   /   s   h  \r  \n   d   a   t   e  \n
0000020
iota: try 1112$

Note that there is a '\r' character at the end of the #! line.
