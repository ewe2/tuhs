I think the RMS stuff should go away.  It's not because I love the guy,
I don't.  It's because we have people like Ken and Rob and other heavy
hitters and my hunch is they have little patience for this sort of thing
(they might correct me if I'm wrong).

I'd love to call out RMS on his BS but this isn't the place.  This is 
the place for people who actually did real work on Unix to share those
stories.  Or so I think, it's up to Warren, not me.
