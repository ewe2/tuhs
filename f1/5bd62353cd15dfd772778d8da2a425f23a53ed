Hmm. I started out wanting to run X11 on a Sun3.  How did I end up here?

I have a Sun3.  I have installed various NetBSD versions.  I found that only
1.3 supports X11.  Others initialize to the point of drawing the stipple
background halfway down the screen and then coredump.  Pro'lly segfault.

I was interested in running real SunOS on my real Sun3 and found it was
available for no cost.

Warren asked about a Sun3 emulator and I found a Sun2 one.  I was hoping to do
trial SunOS installations on an emulator but it appears I'm ahead of my time.
