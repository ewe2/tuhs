Sounds like a perfect topic for a CHWiki page. :-) E.g. this one:

  http://gunkies.org/wiki/Unix_V6_internals

which I did as a bit of an addendum to Lions, to explain rsav, qsav and ssav, and
similar topics.


I noticed in the comparison of your two binary files that the instructions
looked the same, but the a.out headers had a difference, but I didn't remember
the fields in the a.out header enough to know what the differences meant.

I thought I remembered doing an a.out page there, but apparently not. I
thought about doing one now, but decided it wasn't worth it; I just needed to
spin up my V6 system and do 'man a.out'! :-)
