Exactly.  I live in the Santa Cruz mountains, which is awesome (well,
mostly, right now we're having tons of mudlsides, too much rain).  I'm
quite remote, we have a mountain lion that comes through here nightly
(I know because I lost a dog to it and they showed me the radio collar
tracking, on a map it looks like someone took a pencil and scribbled 
back and forth as hard as they could through our place).

In spite of that, I'm typing away to you all, I'm 3ms away from 8.8.8.8
(Google's dns server).  Go wireless.  It's pretty remarkable to be here
and have decent net connectivity.

I do not yearn for the days of SLIP.
