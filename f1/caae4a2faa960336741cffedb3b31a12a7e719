Please note, that identifiers are usually remembered by sound
not by letter sequence. `zalloc' and `zealloc' are likely to
be pronounced similar and thus there is a good chance that
this leads to confusion and errors. Furthermore, `calloc' and
`zalloc' are prone to be pronounced equally or understood
equally, especially by non-native speakers.

Choosing good identifiers is a tough task.
