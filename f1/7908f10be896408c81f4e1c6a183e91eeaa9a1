Not quite yet.  As of 2018, which is the latest data I can find, only 73%
of U.S. households have 10 Mbps download speed or better, and only 46% have
100 Mbps service or better.  If you look at the lowest quartile of
household incomes, the figures are 33% and 18% respectively.  (You want
adoption figures, not deployment figures.)  Wiring up the whole country is
fine, but if people won't or can't use it, it does little good.

None at all, unless you count physical books.  I don't bother with home
backups because they don't provide disaster recovery: I'm not going to be
thinking about grabbing a hard disk on my way out the door if there's a
fire or flood.  Instead, I keep about 186 GB in an S3 bucket (a fair amount
of that is redundant, but it doesn't make sense for me to spend time
deduplicating files).  I also have about 4 GB in two Google accounts.
 Essentially all of that is text/plain, text/html, or application/pdf.

Monday we watch-a Firefly's house, but he no come out.  He wasn't home.
Tuesday we go to the ball game, but he fool us.  He no show up.  Wednesday
he
go to the ball game, and we fool him.  We no show up.  Thursday was a
double-header.  Nobody show up.  Friday it rained all day.  There was no
ball
game, so we stayed home and we listened to it on-a the radio.  --Chicolini
