Many students were writing various pieces of software not in the context of
some larger purpose, but for their benefit. They were then included when 
Joy
% and company
collected up the existing software and distributed it.\cite{halbert1}

In the Berkeley terminal rooms, the dumb terminals beeped
incessantly so most of the bell speakers had been disconnected.
Their \emph{cr3} pager tool rang the terminal bell and waited for a carriage
return after every 24 lines.
The terminals also rang the bell when the cursor advanced near the
right margin on output or keyboard input (like a typewriter
bell).\cite{halbert-jchac1-4}

% TODO: mention cr3 stty mode?
% archives/1970s/2bsd/src/cr3.c says 22 lines and no mention of sound

So Dan Halbert\index{Halbert, Dan}.
who arrived in 1978 as a first-year graduate student,
wrote a pager called \emph{more} that printed ``--More--''
instead of ringing the bell and accepted the space
instead of carriage return to continue. Plus it could take multiple
filenames and print a line of colons around the filenames.
This was inspired by his use of the ITS timesharing systems as an
undergraduate at MIT that put a ``--MORE--'' prompt at the bottom
of the screen when displaying files.\cite{halbert-jchac1-4}

His friends and fellow graduate students, Geoff
Peck\index{Peck, Geoff} and Eric Shienbrood\index{Shienbrood, Eric},
greatly expanded it, adding various
options -- and \emph{more} was added into the next distribution.\cite{halbert1}

Prior to that Chuck Haley had a pager called cr3. Then Bill Joy 
simulated that with a filter "stopping output after each page (22 
lines) to wait for a carriage return, sending 22 more lines, or a EOF, 
sending 10 more lines." (That quote is from the source.)

By the way, I don't have experience with the CR3 control register, and
don't really understand what it means from the hardware perspective.
