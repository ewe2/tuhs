Don't forget James Hendrix's "Small C", which has been around since
what feels like forever.  80x86 and many other ports are available.

The sources are available and widely distributed, though the license
is certainly not a carbon-copy of the GPL (i.e. some will call it
"not open" for one reason or another).
