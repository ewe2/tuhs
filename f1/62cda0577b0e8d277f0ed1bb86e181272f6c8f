Adam,

The emacs you should search for is "Montgomery emacs" written by Warren =
Montgomery - it ran on PDP-11's under Unix.

The first Unix system I had regular access to and learned on was the UCB Cory =
Hall PDP-11/70 running 2.8 BSD starting in Winter 1981, but before I learned =
vi, I'd learned Emacs on TOPS-20 on a DECsystem-20/60 at Stanford during summer =
school a few years prior, so any emacs was the quick way in for me. I switched =
because I got tired of having one finger on the CTRL key all day long ...

IIRC, it was a stripped down version as compared to what I now know is =
"original" Emacs written in TECO macros - no "minibuffer" and some other stuff =
missing, but it had enough of the "right" keybindings that someone who knew =
emacs already could make it go.

I'm still in touch with Ken Arnold (we were contemporaries at UCB), and he =
might be willing to help you make termcap & termlib go on V7 Unix. As I =
remember that code, it's not that big. It wouldn't surprise me if the NetBSD =
CVS repository for that code has the original versions.

As for the Unix Hater's Handbook, a long stretch of the chapter on sendmail =
is an E-mail I sent to the RISKS digest after an E-mail disaster I had to =
manage at Apple ... I remember being surprised at seeing in the published =
book, until I saw the footnote directly quoting the permission I gave the =
authors to publish it. "Oh, yeah ..."
