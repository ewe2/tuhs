CAT = Computer Assisted Typesetter.   It was built by a company called
Graphic Systems (GSI).    It was the original device troff was done for.
Many of the original troff limitations go to the fact it was driving this
device:  there are only four fonts.   These are held on film strips on a
drum.   Not the most sophisticated font system, but ahead of its time.   It
had only been on the market for two years when the labs got it and wrote
troff.

I believe the one we had access to (and used for the previously mentioned
versatec emulation) was at the Naval Research Laboratory.
