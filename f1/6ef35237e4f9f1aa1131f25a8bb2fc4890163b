Thanks. That's interesting.

Did `sort -s` come later? The idea that you preferred clarity over
stability for `sort -u` would indicate so, otherwise one might imagine that
`-u` would just imply `-s` and that would be that.

`sed` in my email was a typo, as you speculated below.

Interestingly, this `sed` construction prior to `sort` loses information,
which perhaps doesn't matter in any given specific case, but is
insufficient in general, which I gathered to be the entire reason you
implemented `sort -u`.

If "sed" was a typo for "sort",


It was.

It's the details of the internal sorts that are most interesting in some
sense, as the merges are probably fairly straight forward but the internal
sorts will affect stability and have other interesting characteristics.

As an aside, one must imagine that, in this day and age, a "big chunk" is
probably big enough to hold the vast majority of files entirely in RAM, and
only exceptionally large files actually require merging multiple blocks.
