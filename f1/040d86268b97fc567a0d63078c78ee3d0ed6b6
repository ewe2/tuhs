Steve Johnson:

  This reminds me that someone at BTL threw together a "TSO Shell".  It was
  a wrapper around /bin/sh that slept for 10 seconds before executing each
  line...

=====

And after each command exited.  Discarding anything typed ahead
during the sleep, of course.

And printed all-upper-case IEFCRAPNONSENSE messages even when a
command exited successfully.

I think I still have a copy somewhere.  It dates from the 6/e era,
so it would need a lot of work to compile and run on a modern system.
Occasionally I think of converting it to ISO and POSIX even though
that seems contradictory somehow.
