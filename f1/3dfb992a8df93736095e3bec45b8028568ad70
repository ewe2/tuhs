Also one of the bigger mistakes the anti-Linux groups made. Among
other things it brought a whole lot of Unix history into the light.
And that was a Good Thing (TM).

I doubt IBM ever did anything more than send an occasional hint
Pamela's way. She did not seem the sort to follow a boss's orders that
way. I did start to worry she'd bought into the Google "Do no evil"
hype at the end, but then she folded it up and stopped posting
articles, so that's moot.

(For what it's worth, I can give an example of her depth of experience
in the software development process: I found in a relatively ancient
MS Windows 3.1 CDROM archive a small Microsoft Windows text editor
project, with a README stating it was in the public domain. It had
obviously been released to help nervous software developers kickstart
their own projects by offering a free windowing framework and text
editing source code. I email her and told her about it, and she
replied it would not be a good idea to let Microsoft know about it or
they would lock it up again. She was a legal assistant, and understood
well tracking cases through the courts, not the software development
process.)
