My 2 cents on Perl.
Having come up on Ken's original shell, the Mashey shell, the Bourne shell
and the Korn shell (and now bash), and a happy awk (and nawk) programmer, I
mostly avoided perl.  But since many others didn't, I've found myself
needing to read perl code, which as Larry stated "It wanted you to be
pretty disciplined in how you wrote it or it becomes write only, but if you
are, it was really pleasant."  Unfortunately, most open source that I
looked at felt to me like write only.  Also, as Dave stated "The chief
problem with Perl, as I see it, is it's like 10 languages smashed
together.  To write it, you only need to know one of the 10.  But to read
it, you never know what subset you're going to see until you're deep in the
code."  Not good for a peruser of perl code (me).  And what's with the
"special" or "magic" variables?  Shades of IBM/OS; not at all Unix-like.
From 1996 until 2013 (when I retired) I was lucky enough to have a Perl
aficionado on my team and he spared me much grief.
