Subject: [TUHS] nm on Third Edition .o files?
Message-ID: <1773a15e-99fb-ea7e-1d30-1af29e048d90@aueb.gr>

Has anyone got a setup where they can run something like nm(1) on the 
compiled Third Edition Unix C files and send me the output? 
(Alternatively, just send me the .o files, and I'll whip up something to 
read their symbols.)  I tried to compile the source code on a modern 
system by hacking old C to something closer to what GCC will accept, 
with commands such as the following.

cc -E dp.c |
sed 's/=\([&|+-]\)/\1=/g;s/struct[ \t]*(/struct {/' |
gcc -w -x c -

However, I stumbled on the use of structure fields on things that aren't 
structures, e.g. "0177776->int =| 300"
