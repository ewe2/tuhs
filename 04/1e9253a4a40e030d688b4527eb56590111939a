I'm not a PUPS subscriber, but I've been browsing the archives and I
wonder if you know anything about this?

My guess is that this was Heinz Lycklama's unreleasable LSI-Unix (LSX),
and I've written him to enquire, but haven't heard back yet.

I'm working on a detailed timeline of Linux prehistory, so I'm also
following your Xenix explorations.  I'd really like to know who did the
first x86 Xenix, HCR or MS?
