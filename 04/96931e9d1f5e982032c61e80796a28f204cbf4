The subject can be looked at from another angle. Consider
the call f(42). This might be read as first naming f (and
thus constructing a pointer to f) and then calling the
function which the pointer is pointing to. So at least
it should be possible to write the call as (*f)(42), which
indeed is equivalent to f(42). So it can be argued that
this notational shorthand should be allowed with all
function pointers.
