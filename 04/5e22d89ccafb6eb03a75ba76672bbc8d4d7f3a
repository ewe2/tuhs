Back in the 80s in my University days  I was  using ISPS (Instruction  Set  Processor  Simulator if  I remember  correctly ) a software tool To simulate CPU.  It ran on a Vax  with  BSD 4.2. I have been  unable  to find any reference to It on the Internet . Do someone on this list  know anything offerte this software ? 

Thanks 
Luca
