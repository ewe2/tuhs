Subject: [TUHS] gatekeeper mirror?
Message-ID: <CAFCBnZvz8k_762GoqNMtOxFs07yGcDZme6N5ojg-UtKaRoUEUw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Does anyone have a mirror of the old ftp site gatekeeper.dec.com? I have
only a small fragment of it, but I'd very much like a full copy. I believe
I have a full copy of ftp.uu.net from October 2003, if anyone's interested.

Also, I apologize if this question is considered inappropriate here, but
did anyone manage to snag a full copy of the titor-special torrent?



Thanks,
Phil Garcia
