right, which is why I bring it up specifically.  It obviously
wouldnt run on the simh vax simulator.  a 68k emulator of some
sort would be needed.  Though it may be moot.  I'm told that
the 8th ed unix distribution was often in two tapes and that
the contents of the second tape, which include the blit stuff,
may be lost to history.
