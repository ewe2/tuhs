Revision 1.1, Sun Mar 21 09:45:37 1993 UTC (25 years ago) by cgd 

http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/sbin/init/init.c?rev=1.1&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&only_with_tag=MAIN

Today is commonly considered the birthday of NetBSD.

Theo told me (seven years ago) that he, cgd, and glass (and one other 
person) planned it within 30 minutes after discussing with the CSRG and 
BSDI guys in the hot tub at the Town & Country Resort in San Diego at 
the January 25-29 1993 USENIX conference. (Does anyone have more to 
share about this discussion?) Soon, cgd had setup a CVS repository 
(forked 386BSD with many patchkits) which was re-rolled a few times (due 
to corrupted CVS). (So maybe March 21 is later than the real birthday.)

As far as I know, it is the oldest continuously-maintained complete 
open source operating system. (It predates Slackware Linux, FreeBSD, 
and Debian Linux by some months.)

"NetBSD" wasn't mentioned by name in the April 19. 1993 release files 
(but was named in the announcement). 
ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/release/NetBSD/NetBSD-0.8

On April 28, the kernel was renamed to /netbsd, the boot loader 
identified it as NetBSD, and various references of 386BSD were changed 
to NetBSD.
