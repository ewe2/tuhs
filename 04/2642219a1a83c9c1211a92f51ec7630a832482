Good to know.

You're right.  What it did share, however, was the OS/8 file system,
except that the date epoch was 1972 instead of 1970.  I don't know if
COS survived long enough to use extended dates.

That didn't actually transfer files, which wasn't necessary; IIRC,
it converted between the COS-310 format for text files (about which
I know nothing) and the OS/8 format (three 8-bit bytes in two 12-bit words,
packed with the first two bytes in the low order bits of the words,
and the third byte split between the four high order bits).

That's what I remember.  My first PDP-8 was running EDU30 on top of
OS/8.

Sure.  What I mean is that the EDUsystems began before the 8/A, not that
they ended before it.
