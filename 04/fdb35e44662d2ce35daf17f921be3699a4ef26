Out of a curiosity, if a C program executes kill(-1, SIGSTOP), will it
itself be stopped? Or can SIGSTOP be ignored?

If so, maybe you could have solved it by stopping everything and then
continuing everything but the offending program. Of course, then you
risk that other programs on the system may have side effects from being
stopped and continued (interrupted system calls they may not be able to
handle, etc)
