And market power is actively misused by major players, but which
is possibly the only natural aspect of them: Google simply uses
Cascading-Style-Sheets to create quotes, which is fine per se, but

actual definition of it, forcing everbody all around the world to
special treat "gmail_quote", otherwise it will look like above.

  Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
