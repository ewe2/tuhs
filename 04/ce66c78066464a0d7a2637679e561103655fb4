Actually, I don't need SCO that much, so I'm fine with Linux. Too bad
they removed ftape subsystem from recent kernels, but this drive
didn't work even for old ones. So I will probably need to port this
stuff to some MCU, so I will need some protocol knowledge,
so I will need to dig into some old sources somewhere. Or find
some known working software package which will work with this drive
and do digging with oscilloscope for protocol.

Thanks a lot!
