Oh, I'm not looking for WYSIWIG or even really WYSIMIM.  I'm well used 
to writing in structural markup and presentation markup languages, e.g., 
LaTeX (which I think is extremely complicated, and since I left the 
university environment I do not miss it).

AS for authoring DocBook I was depending on GNU Emacs to do a lot of the 
heavy XML stuff for me.  Wishful thinking perhaps.

I've had a feeling that Texinfo has been getting brushed to the side.

Are you suggesting that Info is a good as a rendered documentation 
format?  Or just that Texinfo is good for proto-documents that are to be 
authored in a parseable and meaningful format?

I've been a long-time GNU Emacs user so reading Info files is OK for me. 
  But we've never had a _nice_ Info reader, which is why it didn't take 
off I think.  A lot of people REALLY hate the Info UI.

Moreover it was (is?) very difficult to generate good contents and index 
pages with the official tools that I used at the time.  I started 
working on improving this about 20 years ago but back then it felt as 
though the GNU Info and GNU Emacs projects had other things on their minds.

OK, so you are suggesting Texinfo as a prototypical markup language, not 
necessarily something that will end up as Info files?

I have read the Texinfo documentation and I agree that it seemed like a 
rich markup language.

Thank you for the heads up.  I never heard of MOM but MM is more familiar.

*I haven't really looked at eqn beyond browsing docs and I'm not sure 
how much I should expect from it.*

TeX is (still?) the king of mathematical expression typesetting.

Have you looked at Pandoc?  I don't know if it will do this but it's 
worth checking out.
