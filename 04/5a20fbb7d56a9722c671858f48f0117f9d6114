Thanks for the help.

So far I managed to uncompress the files with the custom version of compress
on NetBSD/simh. I then created a .tap file according to the reference in
FORMAT.

I'm using the following config file for simh 3.0.1:

load -r ka655.bin
set rq0 ra82
at rq0 ra82.dsk
set tq tk50
at tq0 quasijarus0a-dist.tap
boot cpu

Here's a transcript of the very first attempt of booting off the tape:

$ ./vax 43cfg

VAX simulator V3.0-1


KA655-B V5.3, VMB 2.7
Performing normal system tests.
40..39..38..37..36..35..34..33..32..31..30..29..28..27..26..25..

-MUA0

Clearly, stand boots. I'm hopeful that 4.3-Quasijarus0a will indeed run on
simh.

For some follow-up questions... Standalone format supports hp and up disks,
but simh only emulates RL and RQ controllers - which means that the Ultrix
utilities to label a cold disk must be ported or recreated to the simh host
platform. Of course, it may well be that applying a hex editor to the disk
image will suffice.

Am I correct that Quasijarus supports RA82 disks (using the ra type) and the
TK50 tape (as a tms)?

Yes, for political reasons I needed to make the 4.3BSD-Quasijarus compressor
a
version of compress, not gzip (can't have any GNU), but I wanted to have the
higher compression ratio of deflation, so I created a new version of
compress
that supports deflation in addition to the original LZW algorith.  You can
find
the new compress in components/compress.tar either on my FTP site or in
Warren's
archive in the 4BSD area.

"4.3BSD-Tahoe Vax distribution" is an oxymoron.  Berkeley released the Tahoe
tape with Tahoe binaries, no VAX binaries.  I was the one who compiled the
Tahoe
source for the VAX, and the result was 4.3BSD-Quasijarus0.

OTOH, you may be referring to the fact that the Tahoe distribution in the
archive is broken.  Yes, it is.  Unfortunately there was an unrecoverable
tape
read error.

This has come up time and again.  SIMH's emulation of VAX is too poor.  VAX
is
not an easy architecture to emulate.
