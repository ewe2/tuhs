That seems consistent with host tables I see.  According to those, there
were no VAXen on the ARPANET in 1980.  However, there were a a dozen or
so in mid 1981; mostly VMS.  (I'd also like to ask about NCP for VMS,
but this is TUHS.)

In early 1982 the number of VAXen has doubled, and out of those 10 are
running Unix including prominent sites like BBN, CCA, PURDUE, RAND, UCB.
Here's the rub.  Some hosts may have jumped the TCP/IP gun ahead of the
1/1 1983 flag day.  The host tables don't say.  Could it be that all
those VAXen were running experimental TCP/IP in January 1982?

The MIT host tables do show the Chaos networks, but I don't include
those in the count.
