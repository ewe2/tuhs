I've always used INN.  I'm happy enough, and it works for me.

There are a few other common news servers.  It depends on the platform 
that you want to run on.

I'm typically seeing < 100 MB of news a day.  My VPS has < 4 GB news 
spool going back 30 days.  My private server has unchecked storage and 
is using about 42 GB.

Peers can be found.  Email if you want help.
