So the obvious question then becomes: Are you saying that Old English 
also borrowed the word from English?

Well, in Scandinavian the port side is called "babord", which comes from 
bare board, since that was the "clean" side, which you could dock on. No 
rudder to break... And it's from way before medieval times... But I'm 
pretty sure the term is from even before the Vikings were around.
