It's still useful.  Minimal example:

[khm at pc ~]$ (exec cd /); echo $?
0
[khm at pc ~]$ (exec cd /nosuchpath); echo $?
/usr/bin/cd: line 2: cd: /nosuchpath: No such file or directory
1

You can use this to dodge some of the crappier shells' problems,
sometimes, or to test for directory accessibility in a clean
environment.  I've run across it in the wild on occasion, even if I
don't really play this sort of game myself.
