Subject: [TUHS] Finding homes for old machines (in the UK)
Message-ID: <0A28D673-D42E-439A-98B1-49202D263526@tfeb.org>

Sorry, this is a bit off-topic, but I'm not sure of anywhere better to  
ask.

I used to have a number of HLH Orion machines, which were superminis  
(they ran BSD 4.2 / 4.3) made in the UK in the 80s and very early  
90s.  A friend of mine still has some, which I suspect may be the last  
ones extant, and a mass of documentation & media for them. He's  
retiring soon and needs to find homes for them.

I think they're historically reasonably interesting machines - I  
suspect they may have been almost the last significant British  
computer design, and the earlier model was quite an interesting  
machine, with user-programmable microcode &c (the later model was, I  
think, not so interesting, if a lot faster).

Does anyone know of any museum-type places which might be able to  
offer them a home?  They are still working (we think, he needs to turn  
them on).  I'm thinking of approaching the Bletchley Park people, but  
I'm wondering if anyone here has any better leads.

Thanks!
