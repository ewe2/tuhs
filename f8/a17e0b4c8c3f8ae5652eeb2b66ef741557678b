I don't know how the later systems work, but in V6, the swap device, and the
start block / # of blocks are specified in the c.c configuration file (i.e.
they are compiled into the system). So you can take one partition, and by
specifying less than the full size to 'mkfs', you can use the end of the
partition for swap space (which is presumably what's happening with /dev/rl0
here).
