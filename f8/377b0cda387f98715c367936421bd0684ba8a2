Subject: [TUHS] weird problem with our Decwriter III terminal ...
Message-ID: <20060621093810.GA24010@freaknet.org>


Hi,

maybe someone here can help us - our problem is that the
decwriter terminal seem to "jump" in particular positions
when printing

we don't understand how to solve this problem - maybe this is a
stepper motor problem, or another problem in gears/transmission?

the problem is evident in this image:

does someone have an idea about this problem?
tnx!

:)
