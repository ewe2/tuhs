Veering off topic but I'm familiar with the Wizard
http://ps-2.kev009.com/ohlandl/CPU/wizard.html

What was the framebuffer used for/under?

The HFT and LFT terms were carried forth into POWER AIX.  AIX 3.x had
a home grown HFT with virtual terminals and some other semi-graphical
features.  AIX 4.X ported a STREAMs based console I/O stack from OSF
and they called it the LFT because it lost all those features; users
were directed to X11 for advanced terminal handling.

Regards,
Kevin
