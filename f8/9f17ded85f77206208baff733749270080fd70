Nothing fancy.  OpenBSD's dhcpd on a server tells the client to pick up
pxeboot (2nd stage bootstrap) tftp from my file server. pxeboot then
loads the kernel over tftp.  The bootparamd daemon on the fileserver
provides info to the client regarding its root directory and swap file,
and the client mounts these over NFS.

It follows http://man.openbsd.org/diskless closely.
