Hello everyone!

I had been lurking this list for long, this is my first post to this
list.

I read with a lot of interest, an old Usenix paper by the late Richard
Stevens on a system called "Portals":

 <https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/neworl/stevens.html>

It explores a lot of ideas that found itself in Plan 9, like a
filesystem interface for sockets etc. Wondering if this survived in any
existing, so called "modern" Unix. I have always felt the need to have
something like this in Unix.

Cheers
