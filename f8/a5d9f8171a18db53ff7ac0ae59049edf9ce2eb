Yes, I googled it per Clem's suggestion and wound up on that exact link 
after wandering around admiring the scenery. I envy the more 
mathematically inclined among us their view of matters technical. This 
piece, being in C and having step by step articulation of the diagrams, 
is better for me than the more formal wikipedia article, although, when 
I get enough background, that looks like it'll be good, too.

Thanks Rob, Clem and Bakul.
