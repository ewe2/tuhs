An old Usenet Apocrypha message.    IIRC this show up after the great
automated crash in 1987 and was being used an example of why the IBM
monoculture led to the melt down of the markets.

Time to post this classic; I don&#39;t recall who wrote it.=C2=A0 Note that=
 the <br>
references are pretty obscure now...<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
VAXen, my children, just don&#39;t belong some places.=C2=A0 In my business=
, I am <br>
frequently called by small sites and startups having VAX problems.=C2=A0 So=
 when a <br>
friend of mine in an Extremely Large Financial Institution (ELFI) called me=
 one <br>
day to ask for help, I was intrigued because this outfit is a really major =
VAX <br>
user - they have several large herds of VAXen - and plenty of sharp VAXherd=
s to <br>
take care of them.<br>
<br>
So I went to see what sort of an ELFI mess they had gotten into.=C2=A0 It s=
eems they <br>
had shoved a small 750 with two RA60s running a single application, PC styl=
e, <br>
into a data center with two IBM 3090s and just about all the rest of the di=
sk <br>
drives in the world.=C2=A0 The computer room was so big it had three street=
 <br>
addresses.=C2=A0 The operators had only IBM experience and, to quote my fri=
end, they <br>
were having &quot;a little trouble adjusting to the VAX&quot;, were a bit h=
ostile towards <br>
it and probably needed some help with system management.=C2=A0 Hmmm, hostil=
ity... <br>
Sigh.<br>
<br>
Well, I thought it was pretty ridiculous for an outfit with all that VAX mu=
scle <br>
elsewhere to isolate a dinky old 750 in their Big Blue Country, and said so=
 <br>
bluntly.=C2=A0 But my friend patiently explained that although small, it wa=
s an <br>
&quot;extremely sensitive and confidential application.&quot;=C2=A0 It seem=
s that the 750 had <br>
originally been properly clustered with the rest of a herd and in the care =
of <br>
one of their best VAXherds.=C2=A0 But the trouble started when the Chief Us=
er went <br>
to visit his computer and its VAXherd.<br>
<br>
He came away visibly disturbed and immediately complained to the ELFI&#39;s=
 <br>
Director of Data Processing that, &quot;There are some very strange people =
in there <br>
with the computers.&quot;=C2=A0 Now since this user person was the Comptrol=
ler of this <br>
Extremely Large Financial Institution, the 750 had been promptly hustled ov=
er <br>
to the IBM data center which the Comptroller said, &quot;was a more suitabl=
e place.&quot; <br>
The people there wore shirts and ties and didn&#39;t wear head bands or cow=
boy <br>
hats.<br>
<br>
So my friend introduced me to the Comptroller, who turned out to be five fe=
et <br>
tall, 85 and a former gnome of Zurich.=C2=A0 He had a young apprentice gnom=
e who was <br>
about 65.=C2=A0 The two gnomes interviewed me in whispers for about an hour=
 before <br>
they decided my modes of dress and speech were suitable for managing their =
<br>
system and I got the assignment.<br>
<br>
There was some confusion, understandably, when I explained that I would <br=
>
immediately establish a procedure for nightly backups.=C2=A0 The senior gno=
me seemed <br>
to think I was going to put the computer in reverse, but the apprentice&#39=
;s son <br>
had an IBM PC and he quickly whispered that &quot;backup&quot; meant making=
 a copy of a <br>
program borrowed from a friend and why was I doing that?=C2=A0 Sigh.<br>
<br>
I was shortly introduced to the manager of the IBM data center, who greeted=
 me <br>
with joy and anything but hostility.=C2=A0 And the operators really weren&#=
39;t hostile <br>
- it just seemed that way.=C2=A0 It&#39;s like the driver of a Mack 18 whee=
ler, with a <br>
condo behind the cab, who was doing 75 when he ran over a moped doing its b=
est <br>
to get away at 45.=C2=A0 He explained sadly, &quot;I really warn&#39;t mad =
at mopeds but to <br>
keep from runnin&#39; over that&#39;n, I&#39;da had to slow down or change =
lanes!&quot;<br>
<br>
Now the only operation they had figured out how to do on the 750 was reboot=
 it. <br>
This was their universal cure for any and all problems. After all it works =
on a <br>
PC, why not a VAX?=C2=A0 Was there a difference? Sigh.<br>
<br>
But I smiled and said, &quot;No sweat, I&#39;ll train you.=C2=A0 The first =
command you learn <br>
is HELP&quot; and proceeded to type it in on the console terminal.=C2=A0 So=
 the data <br>
center manager, the shift supervisor and the eight day-operators watched th=
e <br>
LA100 buzz out the usual introductory text.=C2=A0 When it finished they tur=
ned to me <br>
with expectant faces and I said in an avuncular manner, &quot;This is your =
most <br>
important command!&quot;<br>
<br>
The shift supervisor stepped forward and studied the text for about a minut=
e. <br>
He then turned with a very puzzled expression on his face and asked, &quot;=
What do <br>
you use it for?&quot;=C2=A0 Sigh.<br>
<br>
Well, I tried everything.=C2=A0 I trained and I put the doc set on shelves =
by the <br>
750 and I wrote a special 40 page doc set and then a four page doc set.=C2=
=A0 I <br>
designed all kinds of command files to make complex operations into simple =
<br>
foreign commands and I taped a list of these simplified commands to the top=
 of <br>
the VAX.=C2=A0 The most successful move was adding my home phone number.<br=
>
<br>
The cheat sheets taped on the top of the CPU cabinet needed continual <br>
maintenance, however.=C2=A0 It seems the VAX was in the quietest part of th=
e data <br>
center, over behind the scratch tape racks.=C2=A0 The operators ate lunch o=
n the CPU <br>
cabinet and the sheets quickly became coated with pizza drippings, etc.<br>
<br>
But still the most used solution to hangups was a reboot and I gradually go=
t <br>
things organized so that during the day when the gnomes were using the syst=
em, <br>
the operators didn&#39;t have to touch it.=C2=A0 This smoothed things out a=
 lot.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the data center was getting new TV security cameras, a halon gas=
 <br>
fire extinguisher system and an immortal power source.=C2=A0 The data cente=
r manager <br>
apologized because the VAX had not been foreseen in the plan and so could n=
ot <br>
be connected to immortal power.=C2=A0 The VAX and I felt a little rejected =
but I <br>
made sure that booting on power recovery was working right. At least it wou=
ld <br>
get going again quickly when power came back.<br>
<br>
Anyway, as a consolation prize, the data center manager said he would have =
one <br>
of the security cameras adjusted to cover the VAX.=C2=A0 I thought to mysel=
f, <br>
&quot;Great, now we can have 24 hour video tapes of the operators eating Ch=
inese <br>
takeout on the CPU.&quot;=C2=A0 I resolved to get a piece of plastic to cov=
er the cheat <br>
sheets.<br>
<br>
One day, the apprentice gnome called to whisper that the senior was going t=
o <br>
give an extremely important demonstration.=C2=A0 Now I must explain that wh=
at the <br>
750 was really doing was holding our National Debt.=C2=A0 The Reagan admini=
stration <br>
had decided to privatize it and had quietly put it out for bid.=C2=A0 My Ex=
treme <br>
Large Financial Institution had won the bid for it and was, as ELFIs are wo=
nt <br>
to do, making an absolute bundle on the float.<br>
<br>
On Monday the Comptroller was going to demonstrate to the board of director=
s <br>
how he could move a trillion dollars from Switzerland to the Bahamas.=C2=A0=
 The <br>
apprentice whispered, &quot;Would you please look in on our computer?=C2=A0=
 I&#39;m sure <br>
everything will be fine, sir, but we will feel better if you are present.=
=C2=A0 I&#39;m <br>
sure you understand?&quot;=C2=A0 I did.<br>
<br>
Monday morning, I got there about five hours before the scheduled demo to c=
heck <br>
things over.=C2=A0 Everything was cool.=C2=A0 I was chatting with the shift=
 supervisor <br>
and about to go upstairs to the Comptroller&#39;s office.=C2=A0 Suddenly th=
ere was a <br>
power failure.<br>
<br>
The emergency lighting came on and the immortal power system took over the =
load <br>
of the IBM 3090s.=C2=A0 They continued smoothly, but of course the VAX, sti=
ll on <br>
city power, died.=C2=A0 Everyone smiled and the dead 750 was no big deal be=
cause it <br>
was 7 AM and gnomes don&#39;t work before 10 AM.=C2=A0 I began worrying abo=
ut whether I <br>
could beg some immortal power from the data center manager in case this was=
 a <br>
long outage.<br>
<br>
Immortal power in this system comes from storage batteries for the first fi=
ve <br>
minutes of an outage.=C2=A0 Promptly at one minute into the outage we hear =
the gas <br>
turbine powered generator in the sub-basement under us automatically start =
up <br>
getting ready to take the load on the fifth minute. We all beam at each oth=
er.<br>
<br>
At two minutes into the outage we hear the whine of the backup gas turbine =
<br>
generator starting.=C2=A0 The 3090s and all those disk drives are doing jus=
t fine. <br>
Business as usual.=C2=A0 The VAX is dead as a door nail but what the hell.<=
br>
<br>
At precisely five minutes into the outage, just as the gas turbine is takin=
g <br>
the load, city power comes back on and the immortal power source commits <b=
r>
suicide.=C2=A0 Actually it was a double murder and suicide because it took =
both <br>
3090s with it.<br>
<br>
So now the whole data center was dead, sort of.=C2=A0 The fire alarm system=
 had its <br>
own battery backup and was still alive.=C2=A0 The lead acid storage batteri=
es of the <br>
immortal power system had been discharging at a furious rate keeping all th=
ose <br>
big blue boxes running and there was a significant amount of sulfuric acid =
<br>
vapor.=C2=A0 Nothing actually caught fire but the smoke detectors were conv=
inced it <br>
had.<br>
<br>
The fire alarm klaxon went off and the siren warning of imminent halon gas =
<br>
release was screaming.=C2=A0 We started to panic but the data center manage=
r shouted <br>
over the din, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, the halon system failed its acceptance=
 test last <br>
week.=C2=A0 It&#39;s disabled and nothing will happen.&quot;<br>
<br>
He was half right, the primary halon system indeed failed to discharge. But=
 the <br>
secondary halon system observed that the primary had conked and instantly d=
id <br>
its duty, which was to deal with Dire Disasters.=C2=A0 It had twice the cap=
acity and <br>
six times the discharge rate.<br>
<br>
Now the ear splitting gas discharge under the raised floor was so massive a=
nd <br>
fast, it blew about half of the floor tiles up out of their framework. It c=
ame <br>
up through the floor into a communications rack and blew the cover panels o=
ff, <br>
decking an operator.=C2=A0 Looking out across that vast computer room, we c=
ould see <br>
the air shimmering as the halon mixed with it.<br>
<br>
We stampeded for exits to the dying whine of 175 IBM disks.=C2=A0 As I was =
escaping <br>
I glanced back at the VAX, on city power, and noticed the usual flickering =
of <br>
the unit select light on its system disk indicating it was happily rebootin=
g.<br>
<br>
Twelve firemen with air tanks and axes invaded.=C2=A0 There were frantic ph=
one calls <br>
to the local IBM Field Service office because both the live and backup 3090=
s <br>
were down.=C2=A0 About twenty minutes later, seventeen IBM CEs arrived with=
 dozens <br>
of boxes and, so help me, a barrel.=C2=A0 It seems they knew what to expect=
 when an <br>
immortal power source commits murder.<br>
<br>
In the midst of absolute pandemonium, I crept off to the gnome office and <=
br>
logged on.=C2=A0 After extensive checking it was clear that everything was =
just fine <br>
with the VAX and I began to calm down.=C2=A0 I called the data center manag=
er&#39;s <br>
office to tell him the good news.=C2=A0 His secretary answered with, &quot;=
He isn&#39;t <br>
expected to be available for some time.=C2=A0 May I take a message?&quot; I=
 left a <br>
slightly smug note to the effect that, unlike some other computers, the VAX=
 was <br>
intact and functioning normally.<br>
<br>
Several hours later, the gnome was whispering his way into a demonstration =
of <br>
how to flick a trillion dollars from country 2 to country 5.=C2=A0 He was j=
ust <br>
coming to the tricky part, where the money had been withdrawn from Switzerl=
and <br>
but not yet deposited in the Bahamas.=C2=A0 He was proceeding very slowly a=
nd the <br>
directors were spellbound.=C2=A0 I decided I had better check up on the dat=
a center.<br>
<br>
Most of the floor tiles were back in place.=C2=A0 IBM had resurrected one o=
f the <br>
3090s and was running tests.=C2=A0 What looked like a bucket brigade was wo=
rking on <br>
the other one.=C2=A0 The communication rack was still naked and a fireman w=
as <br>
standing guard over the immortal power corpse.=C2=A0 Life was returning to =
normal, <br>
but the Big Blue Country crew was still pretty shaky.<br>
<br>
Smiling proudly, I headed back toward the triumphant VAX behind the tape ra=
cks <br>
where one of the operators was eating a plump jelly bun on the 750 CPU.=C2=
=A0 He saw <br>
me coming, turned pale and screamed to the shift supervisor, &quot;Oh my Go=
d, we <br>
forgot about the VAX!&quot;=C2=A0 Then, before I could open my mouth, he re=
booted it.=C2=A0 It <br>
was Monday, 19-Oct-1987.=C2=A0 VAXen, my children, just don&#39;t belong so=
me places.<br>
