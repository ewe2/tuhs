Yes, Mach had to provide a BSD layer on top, but that's not the source
of Larry's gripes.

It's the other way around. 4.4 BSD pulled the VM code out of Mach and
into BSD to provide mmap and some level of portability off the Vax. From
there the Mach code got into FreeBSD.  That's what Larry is complaining
about and what Lyndon is saying isn't fair to the Mach guys.

Thanks,

Arnold
