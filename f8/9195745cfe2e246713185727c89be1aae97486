	And I remembered that (correctly as it turns out) without looking

	It's, if I recall, being displayed by 'make'.   There's no coredump
	so the interpretation of 0141 is that of an exit status.  It's been
	a while since I've looked into the problem - it was quite annoying
	to run the sequence (that was causing make to cease) manually and not
	have it happen the same way.

	Ah, ok - that makes sense too.  No, SIGPIPE is the same as it's always
	been since it was first defined as 13

	But something is causing the assembler to exit prematurely and break
	the pipe in the first place.

	SIGPIPE happens, of course, when a writer process writes to a pipe
	where the receiving/reading process has exited.   'as' is exiting
	prematurely - that can be determined by looking at the partially
	created (or empty) .s file that gets left behind.

> Of course if it's a random value handed to sys exit, all rules are off.

	What might be needed is a decent (or existent ;)) syscall tracing
	capability.  That combined with the capability to "coredump a non-0
	exit process) might be enough to track down what's causing 'as'
	to depart the scene prematurely.

	Cheers,
