MacOS X is a certified Unix (tm) OS. Not Unix-Like.

http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/apple.htm

It has been so since 10.0. Since 10.5 (Leopard) it has been so noted on the above Open Group page. The Open Group only lists the most recent release however.

The Tech Brief for 10.7 (http://images.apple.com/media/us/osx/2012/docs/OSX_for_UNIX_Users_TB_July2011.pdf) also notes the compliance.
