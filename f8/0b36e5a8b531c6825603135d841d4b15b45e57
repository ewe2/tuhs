Allow me to add my 2 cents:

Ancient Greece, like all other "primitive" societies that I am aware
of, had beliefs in "spirits" as well as in the CxO level deities (Most
hunter-gatherer and farmer/hunter Stone Age societies didn't get to
the level of CxO dieties, they stuck with spirits behind everything.).
The CxO deities made the policies; very few of them actually carried
those policies out themselves; they relied on a bunch of lesser
spirits to do them. In Classical Greek, daemonoi.

Where the connection with the English word "demon" comes in, is this:
the Christian Church by and large did not believe in the goodness of
most of those alleged daemonoi and labelled them evil, in large part
because in the Christian mythology, there is very little room for
subsidiary spirits; The Christian God is a god without a specific
portfolio: he runs the whole show. Heaps more history there. too much
to cover.

So Maxwell with his Classical education with its heavy emphasis on
Latin and Greek language and culture, would've had a handy metaphor
immediately understandable by all his scientific peers in the Royal
Society, in France, Germany, Russia, the USA, and elsewhere.

And as such, it would be easily extendable to computer science looking
for a handy term to cover system-level background programs handling
details that were between low-level OS procedures and functions and
high-level user programs.

PS FWVLIW, JRR Tolkien took one specific subset of these "spirits",
the woodland spirits, "baptised" them so to speak as he was a devout
Catholic, and turned them into one of the axes of his fiction. Some
years later Cordwainer Smith played the same trick with his Daimoni,
except these Daimoni are more like spirits of the stars. So if you're
a fan of both JRR Tolkien and Cordwainer Smith and wonder why they
seem at times so similar, that is part of the reason.
