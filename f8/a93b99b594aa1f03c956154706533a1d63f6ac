There are more such cases in the utilities collection. For example,
most of the essential code of OpenSolaris bc, dc, diff, fgrep, ed,
and egrep is the same as in v7. (Most comments are new indeed.)

I have created a portable version of the OpenSolaris Bourne shell at
<http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/sh.html>. In the future, utilities
from OpenSolaris will also be included in the Heirloom Toolchest.
This particularly applies to System V utilities that were not in v7
and have not yet been rewritten by me for this purpose. Many
OpenSolaris utilities still contain line length limits, though, and
their multibyte code often exits when it encounters illegal byte
sequences in its input.

I am not that surprised given the fact that BSD was forced to drop
the AT&T code more than ten years ago in order to become free.
