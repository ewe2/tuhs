As a longtime maintenance programmer: I could not agree more. Thankfully 
this idea is fairly well accepted today. Although, I am working on a 
project right now that makes me think the author simply never considered 
that anyone else might ever read or maintain it.

In this context, one of the timeless classics is The Elements of 
Programming Style (Kernighan and Plauger). It had a huge effect on my C 
when I read it years ago and I still try to apply its lessons every day 
in any language.
