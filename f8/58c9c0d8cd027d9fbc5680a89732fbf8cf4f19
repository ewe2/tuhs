Yes, it seems I was thinking of the Lisp calling convention.

Easily determined.  The vax.md (machine description) file
uses CALLS, and in any case gcc runs on both Unix and VMS,
so it has to be VMS-compatible, and there is no switch to
use a different calling convention (the VAX port has few
switches at all: there is one to use G-format floats
instead of D-format).

LLVM has no VAX support at all: the llvm-gcc compiler can
compile for the VAX, but only as a cross compiler.
