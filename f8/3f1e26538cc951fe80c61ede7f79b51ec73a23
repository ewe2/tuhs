Thanks very much, Clem!  I had no idea what was under the hood of the
Masscomps I was using then, fresh out of grad school.  I was on a team
designing a tracking radar system and using the Masscomp as a tool to
control gear and acquire the return signals.  All my attention was on that
and not so much the computer itself.  Super interesting to learn about it.
