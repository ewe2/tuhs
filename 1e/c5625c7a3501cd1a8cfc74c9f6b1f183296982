Subject: [TUHS] 4.4BSD-Lite binaries for SPARC and PMAX
Message-ID: <20020213231038.A172997@krumm.unixag-kl.fh-kl.de>

Hi.

I plan to do a BSD exhibition at the VCFE. Main focus is
4.3BSD{,-Tahoe,-Reno} on VAXen. But I want to show 4.4BSD-Lite on HP300,
SPARC and PMAX too. I have the 4.4BSD-Lite HP300 binaries, but nothing
for SPARC and PMAX. Are there any binaries still around? I don't want to
struggle with a SPARC and PMAX bootstrap...

Ahh, and 4.2BSD-Reno for HP300 is missing too...
