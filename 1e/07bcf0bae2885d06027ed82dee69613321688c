Does anyone know (remember) which Unices had .../bin/[ be a link  
to .../bin/test.  I remember this being the case, but it is not so on  
any recent Solaris. It is the case on my Mac, so in at least one BSD  
derivative.  I looked through a 7th edition tarball from the archive  
and it's not the case there. So my guess is that it is a BSDism, and  
it probably was the case in SunOS 4 and before, and I guess on at  
least 4.2BSD & later.

Thanks
