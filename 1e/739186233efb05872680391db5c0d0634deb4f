I'm going to be AFK all day but a couple of things:

If anyone wants to come out for the funeral (once I figure out
when/where that is) I can offer up a place to stay.  Looking at you,
Clem, love to meet you in person and talk Masscomp.

When I get back to a keyboard I thought maybe it would be nice to share
some Greg stories, I have enough of them.  So I'll try and do that.
