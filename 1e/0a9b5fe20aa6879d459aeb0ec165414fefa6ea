As a third alternative, it's obvious that Simh should have a run-time
config to set the carry-detect bit as always on, e.g

	set ttix carrier=on

In fact, from reading the Simh source it looks like we can already modify the
DL11 address, something like:

	set ttix address ???		# I can't deduce the syntax

So we could modify pdp11_dl.c to have a run-time variable uint16 ttix_carrier
which is default 0, but settable to 004.

If someone can point out the syntax to change the Simh ttix addresses from
17774000-17774177 to 17776500-17776677, I'd be very grateful!
