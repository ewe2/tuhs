Hi.
Nice to hear you have a working system.
As for transfer... Well, there are several ways.

DECnet (if you have it).
KERMIT
TCP/IP (if you have it).
Tapes (if both machine have tape drives)
Disks (both could have SCSI for instance)

So it very much depends on what hardware and software you have.
Also, if you plan on using the Osprey (which the mail almost hints at), 
I think they have the option of hooking up the old disks to the Osprey 
as well.

And then of course, you can ship the disks, or tape backups to someone 
who can do the conversion for you. Me for instance. It's also a question 
of time, money and safety issues involved.

Let me know if you want more help.

	Johnny
