Hmmm...  If it were C-generated then it would be (somewhat) easy, but it's 
hand-written and hand-optimised...  You'd have to do some functional

I know!  Say ~2,000 lines, say ~100 people on this list, distributed 
computing to the rescue!  That's only 20 lines each, so it ought to be a 
piece of cake :-)
