I thought the V6 Mashey shell didn't have anything built in, but there 
were external commands such as goto that would seek the open file 
descriptor to a location matching a label, which would be a comment 
(beginning with a colon, which was a no-op command.)  There would also 
have been an "if" command or option to goto or something.
