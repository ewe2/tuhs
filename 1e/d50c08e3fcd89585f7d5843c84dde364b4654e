Subject: [TUHS] the Data General ECLIPSE MV/7800XP ... booted from tape! :)
Message-ID: <20050901153359.GA11035@freaknet.org>


well,

another great day! we booted via tape! :)))

the problem was that the eclipse need to load the "MICROCODE"
before read anything else; and we had 2 problems:

1) 
the tape head was so dirty that we can feel the dirt on 
the head touching with a finger! after cleaning it, the
tape reader now perfectly!

2)
the microcode original tape is ... in horrible conditions! it
release magnetic particles touching it, and the tape reader
can't read it :(((

BUT

we found that a microcode copy can be loaded from the hard
disk (a 550 mb disk, very big and huge ! :)

so, we can now load the microcode from hard disk and, after
that, boot the DG/UX installation tape :D

AND WE'RE SO HAPPY, SOOO HAPPY, WE LOVE ALL ! :)

the main problem is how to do a backup of the whole disk, 
to preserve the original AOS/VS installation, before trying
an installation of DG/UX.

Any hint? :)

p.s. some images here:

many tnx to eflags for the help (he's the guy in the photos).
It's a sort of JESUS. He touch hardware imposing hands, then 
the hardware magically works.
