For the most part, I agree, but there are some exceptions.  For example,
bit fields in C/C++ are laid out using the byte ordering conventions of
the target machine.  This can make it nearly impossible to write low-level
code to drive, e.g., hardware or communication protocols without
conditional compilation.

Of course, you can always shift and mask.  The code becomes
incomprehensible, but identical for big- and little-endian.  For my money,
using bit fields leads to code that is clear and easy to debug, and the
obvious rationale of the conditional code makes it a winner.
