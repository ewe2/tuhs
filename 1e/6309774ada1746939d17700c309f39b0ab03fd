I have a clear memory of having a discussion with Bill Joy about the 
idea of vread(2) and vwrite(2) when we were both grad students at 
Berkeley. I remember we were eating sausages from Top Dog and sitting 
outside Etcheverry Hall on or near the grassy plaza. I think vfork may 
have already existed, and we were talking about adding some kind of 
memory-mapped file I/O. I think I suggested the actual names, as a 
parallel to vfork. Some of my thinking might have come from my 
experience with TENEX while working summers at BBN. I was just a 
sounding board; I wasn't implementing any of this. vread and vwrite were 
in BSD4.1, but dropped in 4.2 (so my Googling says). I think it became 
clear later that mmap was an easier concept than the initial vread and 
vwrite ideas.
