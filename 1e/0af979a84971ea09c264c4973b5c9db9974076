Yes, I think it is very interesting to see what BSD was like on an x86
around the time of the forks into Net- and FreeBSD. You can feel the
itch to roll your own xBSD when messing around with it.

It got me curious about where 386BSD ended though. Did anyone save the
386BSD Reference CD-ROM Release 1.0 from /dev/null?
