Anyone seriously working on bringing old hardware back to life needs to get
in touch with the Classic Computer Talk list:

    http://www.classiccmp.org/mailman/listinfo/cctalk

A wealth of experience and knowledge on every conceivable topic involved in
old hardware is available there, and people are very helpful.
