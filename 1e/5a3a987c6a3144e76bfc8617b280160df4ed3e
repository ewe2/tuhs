Subject: [TUHS] SCO vs IBM: what unix patents?
Message-ID: <200306110705.h5B75hpO007877@localhost.localdomain>

Just out of curiousity, what patents are there in the current Unix System V
system?  The setuid patent was released to the public, so that can't be
an issue.  And copyright, trade secrets, blah blah, I can understand.  But
I'm curious what is there in System V that has actually been patented?

Thanks,

Arnold
