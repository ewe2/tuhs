To bootstrap on a new machine you implemented an intcode interpreter - probably in assembler and, initially, ran the intcode version of the compiler until you had implemented an ocode to machine code translator for your system.

Hello!
I just ran a Google search (naturally) using the term BCPL, and found
an interesting set of pages. The Wikipedia page on it contains some
darned interesting things. Take for example the TX0 and TX1 computers.
The PDP-1 descends from one of them.

The first MUD was written using BCPL, which I suspect would be right
down a certain correspondent's alley.
