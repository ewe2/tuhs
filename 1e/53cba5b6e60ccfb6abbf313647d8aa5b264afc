Another thought -- the first commercial licensee was Rand.   Hired some
former Harvard students who brought UNIX with them.   You probably need to
add things like Rand Ports (a.k.a. named pipes) which came from there.
Also Chesson and Co did the original ArpaNET NCP at University of Ill
with some help from the Rand folks.   That was done on a V6 system ~ 1978

You also need need Ken's famous V6 'patch' tape -- that 'leaked'
