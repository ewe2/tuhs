16K kernels?

Well, I came late to the UNIX world. I only remember getting a SCO
UNIX 3.2V4.2 kernel onto a single 3-1/2" diskette and still have all I
wanted including (with scripts on a second diskette of course :-) ).
That was 25 years ago.

Mind you, from there I moved to Digital UNIX /vmunix 9,613.712, Tru64
17.930.976 to HP-UX 11iv2  66.161.464 and HP-UX 11iv3 127.929.032

Of course, I also got lots more functionality I'm supposed to want and need :-)

Cheers,
rudi
