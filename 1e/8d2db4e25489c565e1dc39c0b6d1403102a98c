Back when we were running v5 at the University of Toronto, we had a
graphics device that we accessed, on our split I&D space 11/45, using 0,
something like this:

struct x {
   int reg0, reg1, ...;
};

0->reg1 = 0234;

Several old details of old C made this possible as well: Struct tags were
global, -> worked on any pointer, and ints and pointers were
interchangeable.
