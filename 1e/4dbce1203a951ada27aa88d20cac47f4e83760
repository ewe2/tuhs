Take another look at Solaris 11 - the pkg command is basically the same 
thing. Install PHP, MYSQL, Apache, update the system, do almost anything.

I've booted Solaris 11 on a slew of servers and PC's since it came out. 
 From Intel SATA to LSI SAS, Emulex fiber channel cards, Qlogic fiber 
cards, Intel 10Gbe NICs, etc.

It just "works". While you had to pay attention to the HCL back in the 
Solaris 7/8/9 and early 10 days, and adjust accordingly, Solaris has 
been pretty decent in the past few years in terms of hardware 
compatibility.  Except for one horrid instance where the Emulex driver 
would fail if virtualization was turned on - but in 11.3, that seems to 
have been fixed (or, the hardware changed, I installed it on newer M630 
Dell hardware).

For the "desktop" however, I just don't use it as a desktop. Windows won 
that war for me.

As for performance, I'll have to look into that - I remember a while 
back that Oracle's best practices for it's database was to turn off NUMA 
under Linux, but not Solaris. Either way, virtualization (VMware mostly) 
has made that a moot point in many of the environments I administer.
