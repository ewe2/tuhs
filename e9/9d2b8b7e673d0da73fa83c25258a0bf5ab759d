Greetings,

I am looking for a copy of Ultrix 4.5 preferably on TK70 tapes but any
medium will do. I have a MicroVax 3300 that I would like to breath life
into again. Unfortunately the version in the Archives is too old to be
of use and it seems that  there is no DSSI support in NetBSD. I would be
willing to trade old computer parts in return(I have Old SGI, Dec PDP
and and Sun Stuff). Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
