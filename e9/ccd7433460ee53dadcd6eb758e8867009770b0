Subject: [TUHS] Mirror of Mike Mahoney's oral history of Unix
Message-ID: <20151225232958.GA1535@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, Doug McIlroy sent me an e-mail about the late Mike Mahoney's project
to create an oral history of Unix. His documents are at
http://www.princeton.edu/~hos/Mahoney/unixhistory

I've taken the liberty to mirror them into the Unix Archive and they are
now also at http://minnie.tuhs.org/Archive/Documentation/OralHistory/

Cheers, Warren
