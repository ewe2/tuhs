Not my experience.  At least from what I was working on the 1980s
there was a need to be able to keep complicated state in graphical
programs which is when assembly language versions of threads came
into being.  Made it possible for whatever was generating output
to be interrupted so that input could be handled in a timely manner.
I seem to recall getting some code from Sun for this that I ported
to a different system.
