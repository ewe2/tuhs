For several years now, Sybase has been announcing that it will release
the source code to its C/C++ and FORTRAN compilers.  This is _still_
vaporware.  Their latest press release suggests that they have decided
on a License - but won't even make that public at present.

You can download a Windoze executable, but that is not of much use for
Unix.  And the size of the download suggests that there will need to
be a fair bit of work to make it run natively in a 16-bit environment.

At this time, the only open-source 16-bit x86 C compiler I know of is
Bruce Evans' C compiler (bcc).
