If I'm understanding correctly, an I/O on the slave side would cause
an event on the master side.  So the master was almost like a debugger
with break points at open/read/write/lseek/close?

That would explain a lot of the complexity.  And if the slave does a
read(comm, buf, 1<<20) I suspect that the master does multiple writes?
As in is there a PIPEBUF analogy?
