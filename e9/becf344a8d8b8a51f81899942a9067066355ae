FWIW: I referenced both PL/C and IBM PL/1 compiler in my quora answer.
In an interactive world, offering a note like Grammerly's underline, seems
reasonable to me - because it forces me to accept it.   The automatic doing
it for me, is what I dislike - as you said, on touch interfaces it's
twice as bad.

I remember having a conversation with Doug Cooper when we all were teaching
the intro to CS course and I we were getting students turning in
'auto-corrected' code for assignments and wondering why the TAs were not
amused.  I had thought that having the compiler tell you what was in error
and then maybe offering a suggestion, might make sense, but there needed to
be some action on the student's part to accept >>and<< repair to code
before the compiler would produce something that 'ran.'

Anyway, I still think "*Damn Warren's Infernal Machine*" was always well
named.
