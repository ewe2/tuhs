That doesn't mean that it's great.  It's only easy to use once one learns
the quirks, like it appearing to hang with no feedback when you hit buttons,
and the way one has to click "done" when you're not actually done.  The
number of options is so small that I think that it would be better to just
have the whole configuration on a single screen so that newbies wouldn't
have to wonder where things were done and whether or not they'd be able to
"go back" without trying it.

Huh, I thought that most of the linux developers these days ran on Macs.
