I made a diff and put all the changes to the kernel in svn.  I just
checked it in.

I tried "cold=1" and it seems to have written a file system to the RF
disk.  It looks correct from a dump anyway.

I think the init dies because "sys read" does not work and there are
still missing pages.

I'll add the missing pages from James' work next.
