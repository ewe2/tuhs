I guess that's true. My experience is that GNU Awk (gawk) was used on
the side a lot, alongside Unix awk on Unix systems.  When gawk became
*the* awk on Linux systems, that's when it really started getting pounded
on, and that's when many of the significant bugs and/or performance
issues got shaken out.

I suspect that this is true of the other major GNU tools, such as
Bash, coreutils, etc.
