Hey Clem,

lol, it’s funny, but there’s still lots of stuff I use it for despite the
fact that I haven’t really worked on it in years.

There’s a version up on the net here: http://videoteco.cvs.
sourceforge.net/viewvc/videoteco/videoteco/

although I can’t say how well that builds these days… Still, people are
welcome to give it a try.

I keep thinking about re-writing it in a modern language…
