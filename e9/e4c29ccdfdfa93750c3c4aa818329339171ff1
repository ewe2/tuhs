Subject: [Unix-jun72] jun72 init.s
Message-ID: <Pine.BSI.4.64.0805041601230.20114@malasada.lava.net>

I entered init.s and played around with it a little.  I *think* it might
be working (I stepped through some of it) but it doesn't use the normal
tty in multi-user mode, so it's hard to tell without dc-11 support.
I guess it was lucky that we used the s2 init instead of the jun72
init, because it seems the s2 init does run getty on the main terminal
in multiuser mode.

The process for building it is:

    $ tools/rebuild
    $ tools/as sys1.s build/init.s

and you'll have a "b.out" in the current dir.

Is anyone planning on working on dc-11 support?
