True. Not sure how much changed though. Do you have any list of things 
that differs, and things that AA or Heathkit did better?

True that I grew up on DEC OSes, but I never used EDT. Always Emacs. 
(Proper Emacs, that is, not the GNU stuff... :-) )

Possible. But people in general seems to have preferred the VT100 to 
most other stuff on Unix as well, judging by history.

Indeed. To each his own. No problem with that.
And yes, most VT-100 emulators suck seriously. I usually identifies the 
first problem within 10 seconds, and almost all emulators do some of the 
common simple stuff wrong.

xterm is my savior. It actually do things pretty might right all the time.

Let me guess - the missing escape key? :-)
(That one drove almost everyone bonkers...)
