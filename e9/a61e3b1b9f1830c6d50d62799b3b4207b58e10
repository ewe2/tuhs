Subject: [TUHS] About early Un*x clones
Message-ID: <200306222241.33385.wes.parish@paradise.net.nz>

Whitesmith under the capable guidance of Plauger - who else - came up with 
Idris.  And a number of other Un*x clones were duly written at about the same 
time, according to:
http://www.robotwisdom.com/linux/nonnix.html

The question is, is it possible to get ahold of those for the early Un*x  
hobbyist?  Does anyone have any knowledge of their whereabouts, and 
(potential) legal statii?
