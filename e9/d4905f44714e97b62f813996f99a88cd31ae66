The =E2=80=9Chardware / software tradeoffs=E2=80=9D paper I linked =
yesterday has an interesting discussion about the mouse, including many =
details of how it worked. It says that the Blit originally used a tablet =
but was later redesigned to use a mouse. You may be seeing a few remains =
of the the tablet interface.

I noticed that the rom images are dated Dec 1982. The build process' =
output file =E2=80=9Cromterm=E2=80=9D is dated Nov 1983. Some of the =
libraries have source files with dates into 1984. It would seem that the =
surviving rom images are for a fairly early iteration of the system.
