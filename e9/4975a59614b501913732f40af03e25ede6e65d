Well, for a lot of customers they are still very real.  More for archiving
than for backups in some cases.  I personally trust *good* tape technology
more than el-cheapo bit SATA drives (SATAn drives as one of my colleagues
likes to call them when they are causing grief).  

What one does see quite often is some kind of virtual tape system with disk
backing storage that is the first stage backup.  After some time the data is
offloaded from virtual tape storage onto real tapes for storing them in some
concrete vault.  Obviously virtual tape gives you nice things like dedupe
etc.
