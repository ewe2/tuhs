Oh wow, that jogs loose some more stray memory cells.  Found the Tempo
manual on-line which had a front panel picture.  There was one of these
sitting in a rack near the window in the 516 lab back when we were in
building 2.  Not sure if it ever made it to building 7, might have been
tossed.  This thing a telephone handset hanging off of it.

Nice to see the networked IC test system that I mentioned the other day
in the datamation article on page 52.  It was on the loop, not the spider,
when I worked on it.
