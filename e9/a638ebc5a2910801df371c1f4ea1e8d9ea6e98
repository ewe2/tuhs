Subject: [TUHS] UNIX V6 line 3973: Is it really a typo?
Message-ID: <200610181952.PAA18259@cuzuco.com>


See the December 2002 discussion threads "V6: 50 bugs tape"
and "Patches to improve 6th Edition" in the archive
(http://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2002-December/date.html)
While not specifically mentioned in those mails it is part
of the 50 bugs tape -- you'll want to extract usr/sys/v6unix/* from
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Applications/Spencer_Tapes/unsw3.tar.gz
and you'll see it fixed in usr/sys/v6unix/updat/ken/sig.c
