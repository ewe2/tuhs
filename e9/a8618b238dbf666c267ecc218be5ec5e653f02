Frankly, I don't give a hoot about what the FSF or especially RMS cares
about.   RMS used to show up at my house on a regular basis, and I spent
time in the early FSF with some of the people I really respected other than
RMS (like Len Tower).   RMS while condemning everybody else, cares little
about other than himself and his sociopathically depraved views of the way
the world should be.    And as Forrest Gump would say "Tha'ts all I have to
say about that."
