I=E2=80=99ll omit comments on Data Generals, DEC-10/20, and other =
non-UNIX stuff.

We had a series of three supercomputers at the BRL.    The first was the =
Denelcor HEP which was pretty much purpose built for us.   Originally =
slated to be an Analog, then Hybrid, it ended up as a MIMD ECL-logic =
digital machine.   Denelcor was stalled on what OS to use and was =
writing their own proprietary one when we stepped in and told them we =
would put UNIX on the thing.     The thing was slated to share the main =
computer center room with the last Cyber 7600 ever build.    We had =
taped out the location of all the cabinets on the floor around this =
building pillar.     Shortly after I started at the labs, I flew out to =
Denelcor and noted that the machine was sitting on their floor in our =
configuration except they had tape where our building pillar was.    It =
was kind of a fun research exercise.   The thing had 4 PEMs which each =
could run 8 independent (what we would call in UNIX) processes.    The =
hardware could also schedule for each of these up to 256 (what we would =
call in UNIX) threads.   All the memory had two semaphores on each word =
(full/empty bits) and the various load/store operations could be told to =
=E2=80=9Cwait for full=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cwait for empty.=E2=80=9D

The I/O on the thing was a box that had 32 individual UNIBUSs on it.   =
It=E2=80=99s memory showed up on the common memory bus (really a big =
network) without the semaphore bits.   I wrote all the UNIX IO code to =
drive this stuff and found out that it was taking forever to start I/Os. =
   This was because they had put the control logic on this secondary bus =
called (aptly) =E2=80=9CThe Low Speed Bus.=E2=80=9D    The LSB=E2=80=99s =
primary function was to get the machine booted up (which involved =
programming the network swtich for the regular memory channel).   =
Confronted with the problem at the local Golden Corral one night, Burton =
Smith the original designer and I designed a new control system to use a =
spare PDP-11/34 I had that would connect things up direct to the =
highspeed memory.   It ran the same pidjin OS that our internet routers =
ran (LOS=E2=80=A6no time for sharing, uniprocessor system).

Tthe thing excelled at highly parallelizable stuff like Mike=E2=80=99s =
raytrace code and really all it ever got used for is to make a movie =
=E2=80=9CA Shell=E2=80=99s-eye view of a tank.=E2=80=9D

It got shutdown and promplty replaced with the Army=E2=80=99s first =
=E2=80=9Creal=E2=80=9D supercomputer, a Cray X/MP.    This particular =
machine was slated for delivery to Apple, but the Army used =
=E2=80=9Cemergency=E2=80=9D authority to get Cray to give it to us.    =
We pretty much insisted on runing UNICOS (Cray=E2=80=99s UNIX) rather =
than Cray=E2=80=99s prorpietary OS.     As I recall, the X/MP didn=E2=80=99=
t really require anything special as far as facility goes.    There=E2=80=99=
s a picture in my files somewhere of me standing in the middle of the =
thing peering out.

One of my last jobs at BRL was to be on the selection board for the Cray =
2 there.    That as the previous poster states, required a lot of =
specialized facility work.   It wasn=E2=80=99t installed before I left, =
but it was my signature that was on the $25 Million dollar procurement =
paperwork for that thing.

Amusingly, Mike wanted to call the two machines Patton and Rommel (hey, =
it=E2=80=99s the army).   We named the XMP Patton, but then one of our =
interns whose last name was Patton managed to wreck his car and kill =
himself so the powers that be decided that the Patton name would =
officially dedicated to him and nixed the idea of Rommel.   The Cray 2 =
was named after long term director of the laboratory, Robert J. =
Eichelberger (father of modern shaped charges).   The problem is that =
Eichelberger wasn=E2=80=99t a workable name on the network, and RJE had =
bad connotations with regard to old mainframe submittals.    The machine =
was officially known as =E2=80=9CBob.=E2=80=9D
