Having done exactly this with one of my own systems back in the early 
90's, I decided to test this out - I have some Solaris 8 VM's that I was 
able to clone easily and rip off the networking.

kilowatt# mkdir a
kilowatt# cd a
kilowatt# touch .a .b .c
kilowatt# rm -rf .*
kilowatt# ls -a
.   ..
kilowatt# rm -rf .*
rm of . is not allowed
rm of .. is not allowed

Now I need to go check some of the other VM's I have of early SVR4... I 
think it was either SunOS or an early SVR4 where this had catastrophic 
results :)
