I think other things were updated as well, in line with differenet versions
of BSD, but I don't have any sort of definitive list.

To clone a disk, yes, you need to start with a good disk :-)

Linux source, especially early versions, or a full BSD 4.x distribution, eg
from the PUPS archive?

I've looked at the scripts (sorry, didn't have time yesterday).  They're
not Acorn's.  They were created by Granada Microcare's Field Service
division when they had to upgrade R140 versions of RISC iX -- 1.13 was a
bugfix release.

They should work, providing the versions of the kernel and other files in
my version will fit on a floppy.  I'm not sure how best to get your tar
file back though; it doesn't look like the minimal system has NFS support.
 You ought be able to do it if you had a spare hard drive, put the tar file
on it, and mount it under /mnt.  Modify the tar command in cpsys so it
doesn't overwrite /mnt, like James and I did.

dsplit is just a utility (written by Acorn?) to split a big file over
several floppies, or extract it again (like bsplit, but probably with
different markers).

No.  That's a linux invention.  But I can probably create the floppies for
you, when I have time to move my R260 to somewhere I can use it -- probably
not this weekend, maybe the weekend after.

What machine have you got?  R140, R260, or something else?  Is it the same
type as the filesystem you copied came from?
