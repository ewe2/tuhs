Subject: [Unix-jun72] T4002A
Message-ID: <Pine.BSI.4.64.0805090739480.20114@malasada.lava.net>

An early section of the jun72 document has some code for
"modifications to UNIX to accomodate the T4002A graphic console."
Is anyone familiar with this?  If we could emulate this device
easily, it might be fun to enter this patch as an optional patch
to the system.
