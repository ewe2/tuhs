Sockets woah indeed.  Shout out to Clem and the Masscomp doc people because
they, not UW Madison that was doing all sorts of good work, the Masscomp 
docs got me to understand sockets.

Richard, I get it, it is a light bulb moment when you realize that
you can get two unrelated processes talk to each other.  It bumps your
understanding of what is possible.  Which today seems lame, there is so
much, but I get it, back then that was huge.
