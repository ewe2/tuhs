Based on some vague recollections of early days at Sun...  I seem to recall
that one of the main differences between /bin and /sbin was that the /sbin
binaries were all built with static libraries rather than shared.  I heard
/sbin described as "single-user bin"...

I don't know when /sbin first appeared, though.
