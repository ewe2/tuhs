I've been having a good time watching YouTube videos that have Brian =
either interviewing or being interviewed by assorted folks.  My favorite =
one, so far, is this "fireside chat":

	VCF East 2019 -- Brian Kernighan interviews Ken Thompson
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DEY6q5dv_B-o

In any case, the K&P book I'd _really_ like to see brought up to date is =
"The Elements of Programming Style".  It could have been subtitled "How =
to write small, simple programs that work."  It's still a very fine =
book, but I'm not sure that the current crop of beginning programmers =
would be patient enough to deal with the sadly dated example code.


If you're still here, I'll give you a vignette from many years ago.  My =
spouse and I were both early fans of AWK, having been introduced to it =
around 1983 by our friend Jim Joyce.  Indeed, she used AWK to process =
line printer plot files (dendograms, for the curious) into a format that =
my homegrown SunCore interpreter could render for screen display and =
printing on our dot matrix printer.  Some of them ended up in her =
Master's Thesis...

Anyway, we traveled with Jim to Copenhagen for a EurOpen conference.  At =
the closing banquet, I got to an empty table before anyone else and =
tossed down a "no smoking" placard.  Vicki and I then sat down.  Shortly =
thereafter, Brian walked past and saw the placard.

	Brian:  "Is this a non-smoking table?"
	Us: "It is now. (:-)"

So, he sat down and we had a chance to dine with a personal hero (and =
all-around nice guy). The next day, we got on a train to Stockholm, on =
our way to Helsinki (to teach a Unix Intro course with Jim).  Our =
four-person compartment turned out to include Brian, Vicki, me, and a =
long-suffering European businessman.  IIRC, we pestered Brian for hours =
about AWK, Bell Labs, and so forth.  He was unfailingly gracious and a =
wonderful person to spend the trip with.
