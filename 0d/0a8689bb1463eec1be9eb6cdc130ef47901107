I thought Benno Rice=E2=80=99s argument a bit unorganized and ultimately =
unconvincing, but I think the underlying point that we should from time =
to time step back a bit and review fundamentals has some merit. =
Unfortunately he does not distinguish much between a poor concept and a =
poor implementation.

For example, what does =E2=80=9Ceverything is a file=E2=80=9D mean in =
Unix?
- Devices and files are accessed through the same small API?
- All I/O is through unstructured byte streams?
- I/O is accessed via a single unified name space? etc.
Once that is clear, how can the concept then best be applied to USB =
devices?

Or: is there a fundamental difference between windows-style completion =
ports and completion signals?

Many of the underlying questions have been considered in the past, with =
carefully laid out arguments in various papers. In my view it is =
worthwhile to go back to these papers and see how the arguments pro and =
contra various approaches were weighed then and considering if the same =
still holds true today.

Interestingly, several points that Benno touches upon in his talk were =
also the topic of debate when Unix was transitioning to a 32 bits =
address space and incorporating networking in the early 80=E2=80=99s, as =
the TR/4 and TR/3 papers show. Of course, the system that CSRG delivered =
is different from the ambitions expressed in these papers and for sure =
opinions on the best choices differed as much back then as they will now =
- and that makes for an interesting discussion.
