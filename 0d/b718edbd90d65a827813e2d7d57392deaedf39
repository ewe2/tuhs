Hard disk drives are yesterday's criterion.  Now it's microSDXC cards.
Physical volume 0.165 ml, up to 200 GB.  I've seen claims that my
station wagon has a cargo volume of 2,752 l, though that seems on the
high side.  That corresponds to about 16,670,000 cards or 3.3 EB.
Take that on a 20 minute drive, and you end up with a link bandwidth
of about 22 Pb/s.

Who needs FedEx?  Of course, the link bandwidth is no longer the
bottleneck.
