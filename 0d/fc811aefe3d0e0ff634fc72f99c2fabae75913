These are all on NetBSD 0.9 i386 with no modifications to the system,
and they just represent source I had quickly on hand...  NetBSD 0.9
uses gcc 2.4.5

I have to admit, I'm almost thinking of something like this for
embeded systems, having more then 4mb of ram is common place now, and
hell I like the idea of static exe's so I don't have dll issues... As
the dynamic libs didn't come into play until NetBSD 0.9, right?
