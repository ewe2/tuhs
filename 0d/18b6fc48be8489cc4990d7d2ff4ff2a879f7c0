idk. As far as I know, IBM Austin did not get source licenses until 
System V. Before Clay Cipione became the AIX development manager in the 
AFWS -> RT transition, Austin did not have source licenses, as far as I 
know. Clay insisted that we have source.

It is plausible that Don Rozenberg had V7 license at Yorktown and/or 
ACIS had V7 license for BSD stuff.

I'm blind copying Clay and another AIX alumnus that might know for sure.
