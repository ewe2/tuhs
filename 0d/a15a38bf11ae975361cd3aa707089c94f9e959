Looks excellent -- friendly edit -- ditroff had nothing to do with
vcat/vpr/vtroff.   Tom Ferrin wrote the original at UCSF in the mid/late
70s -- the reasons was the the CAT typesetter was expensive and actually
kinda nasty run.   Many of us had plotters in those days and Tom's hack was
a welcomed addition to the tool set.

instead of:

leading some developers to contrive translators for C/A/T-formatted
documents to other devices.  An example was vtroff for Versatec and
Benson-Varian plotters.


I offer:

In mid/late 70s, Tom Ferrin a graphics researcher at UCSF using the font
set released in the late 1960s, from Alan Hershey [
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey_fonts], wrote a program to simulate
the C/A/T typesetter allowing the output of the original troff program to
be 'plotted'. This program originally called vcat for virtual cat
typesetter, was first distributed as part of an early USENIX distribution
tape, but was eventually re-released in 3BSD and later BSD distributions as
the UCB vpr(1) command and associated wrapper that call it was created
called vtroff.

As I understand it, _this_ RUNOFF is undisputedly Doug McIlroy&#39;s.<br>
