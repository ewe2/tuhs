OT, but of interest to a few people here :-)

The venerable PDP-8 was introduced in 1965 today (or tomorrow if you're on 
the wrong side of the date line).  It was the first computer I ever 
used, back around 1970 (I think I'd just left school and was checking out 
the local University's computer department, with a view to majoring in 
Computer Science (which I did)).
