Yeah, I hear you.   We wrote wrappers for most of the RCS commands to do checkin and then checkout unlocked.   The EMACS macros were helpful in this because it assumed you worked the way you do (look at a read-only version when not checked out for editing).

We just jumped the version numbers when we needed a common point.

We lived with RCS until we switched to Clearcase.
