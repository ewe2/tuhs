Subject: [pups] Making a TK50 2.11BSD boot tape for an 11/73
Message-ID: <200301161754.h0GHsbn49154@minnie.tuhs.org>

If all that is needed is to concatenate three files into a single
tape file, with each new file aligned on a block boundary, isn't

	(for f in f1 f2 f3; do dd <$f conv=sync; done) >/dev/rmt0

sufficient?

The only time I had to do anything like this, the target system was
a MicroVAX; hence the tape had to have ISO labels, and the program
to be booted a particular tape filename.  I don't remember how I
handled that; probably I used one of the several public-domain
tape-label-writing programs.  But that was a VAX; I would assume
an 11/73 doesn't have so much enforced complexity in its firmware.
