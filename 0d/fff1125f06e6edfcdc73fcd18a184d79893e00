Is this really necessary?  There's a certain amount of traffic
necessary to keep a list going, and restricting it can have unwanted
results.  Yes, I agree, there's a lot of traffic at the moment, and
I'm having trouble with it too, but it'll subside of its own accord.
And who knows, maybe some unexpected gem might pop up.
