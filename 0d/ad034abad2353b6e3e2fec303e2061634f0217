I've had occasion to use groups extensively in various places I've 
consulted. Defense Contractors, educational institutions, etc. That, and 
quotas.

I've used Solaris ZFS ACLs, and Linux ACLs to solve many problems. 
There's always an exception to the UNIX rule when it comes to 
owner/group/world, and trying to corral users into that paradigm is not 
always fruitful.

Although, in one case, a common storage area with both the setgid and 
setuid bit on the parent, and various Engineering departments writing 
files and directories to it, was a really cool solution to a problem 
although it used secondary groups as well.
