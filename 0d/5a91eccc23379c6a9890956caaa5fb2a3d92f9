Hello!
And you're going to react similarly when I mention that I first met
AIX at an event concerning UNIX in general, in fact UNIXEXPO, and
there it was the crowd of RT/PC designs that looked like strangely
dressed PC/AT ones, and scared the stuffing out of the salesperson
when I simply logged into each working station by using the telnet
command and asking her the name of each.

Next time they looked like the way they looked much the same as the
final style, and that's what the salesmen said. that.  I also laughed
at it.

I found the SUN booth more interesting. But Larry knows why.
