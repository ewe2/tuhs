Nice, I have one too (an UC08, which is just a dual-port version of the '7).

Yup.. come to Holland, attend one of the 6-weekly "dump" shows, and find
yourself
loaded with 1 and 2GB drives for a couple of bucks...

Ultrix will think it is an RA81, most likely.  The controller will be seen
as
either an RQDX3 (MFM QBUS) or an UDA50 (MFM Unibus).  Never tried that, 'cos
the
controller is still on my "todo shelf".  Drives attached to either will
report
as RAxx'es...

I have a kernel with "RA99" compiled in.  That is a test for my experimental
support for Ultrix-32-like "partition tables" (/etc/chpt et al).  Works OK
so far...

Anyway.  Uhm, your drive most probably should work fine when referred to as
an RA81 on an RQDX or similar.. UDA50 comes to mind.

Cheers,
	Fred

Actually, the UDA-50 isn't MFM, it's SDI. The QBUS equivalent is the
KDA-50.

There is no MFM controller for Unibus. That is, no equivalent of the RQDXn
exists for Unibus.

Disks on the RQDXn reports as RDxx or RXxx, while disks on the [KU]DA-50
reports as RAxx (from a hardware point of view). They're both MSCP
controllers though.

Johnny,

Ahhh, i knew it was something-50 :)  Twas a while ago since I 
last touched a Unibus box.. can you tell? :)

Yup.  The UC0x talks MSCP (and/or TMSCP, if configured) on the Qbus
side, and SCSI on the device side.  I have an UC08 which is configured
for MSCP on bus 0, and TMSCP on bus1.  The attached Exabyte 8200 (2GB)
is seen as a giant TK50 :)

That was on the MVII, though.. havent used it since.  Was going to
put it in the 11/83, _if_ I can find a BA123. Anyone got one of those
laying around? :)

Cheers,
	Fred
