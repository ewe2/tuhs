A decision is a decision, and I don't pretend that you revert it.

However, Joerg Schilling, notwithstanding his (lack of?) social
abilities and confrontational style of writing, has provided valuable
historical information, and has a non-dismissable background. It is
also worrying that this is making TUHS even more USA-centric, and that
his european point of view (however removed from "on-the-ground" MIT-
or Berkely-epicenters first hand info) is being silenced.

In my opinion, the TUHS list has been a very enjoyable read in recent
times, and those who found Joerg unpalatable had already "kill-filed" him.

Peace,
