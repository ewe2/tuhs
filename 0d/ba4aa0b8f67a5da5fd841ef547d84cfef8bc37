Hello,

I have a file with ".TITLE PDP-9/GRAPHIC II VERSION OF SPACEWAR".  (I
hope it will go public soon.)  It seems to be a standalone program, and
it's written in something close to MACRO-9 syntax.  I'm guessing the
Bell Labs version would have been written using the Unix assembler.

Best regards,
Lars Brinkhoff
