There's some on www.multicians.org, but it doesn't relate to B
or Unix:
  http://google.com/search?q=site:multicians.org+tmg

"About TMG" on the McClure Group page is unfortunately not available:
  http://www.mccluregroup.ca/

FOLDOC entry on TMG:
  http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?TMG

Another page which describes TMG (but the phrase "MULTIX was the name
of the first-generation UNIX" makes me suspicious):
