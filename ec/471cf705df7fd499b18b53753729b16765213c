One of my first jobs I did for the company that I ended up working for =
decades was a job for IBM FSD to put a second ethernet interface in to =
=E2=80=9Csecure XENIX=E2=80=9D (a MLS system) to allow the system to be  =
used for downgrading classified material.    This gave us an in with IBM =
FSD and this led to us doing work with an IBM on a pair of microchannel =
i860 coprocessor cards called the Wizard and the W4.   We ported AIX to =
both of them.    The cards ran inside of another AIX PS/2 system so the =
TCF was really handy in allowing apps that only had 386 versions to run, =
the ability to maintain a common file system, and to share peripherals.  =
 Indeed, I think the major reason IBM used the TCF concept is it gave =
the 370 version of the thing an easy way to interoperate with user=E2=80=99=
s on the PS/2=E2=80=99s.   3270=E2=80=99s and other terminals designed =
for the mainframe really weren=E2=80=99t suited for UNIX.

The initial Wizard card had no I/O other than the host PS/2.    It was =
really more or less an academic experiment (the cards were also buggy).  =
  Two amusing things however came out of that port.   The AIX for the =
PS/2 had this thing to multiplex the normal VGA display (outside of X) =
called the =E2=80=9CHigh Function Terminal.=E2=80=9D   Our i860 version =
was less capable so it was denoted the =E2=80=9CLow Function =
Terminal.=E2=80=9D     The other was that I hacked the -mm macro package =
to mimic the style of the IBM manuals so we could write =E2=80=9CIBM-ish=E2=
=80=9D documentation.

The W4 card was interesting.   It had 4 i860 processors along with =
it=E2=80=99s own framebuffer.    One of my employees spent a lot of time =
of in Owego fixing the memory system (the whole thing was set up with =
these Xilinx PGAs that were easy to update in the field).     Amusingly, =
the machine-specific parts of the W4 version of the AIX kernel had more =
in common with the 370 version than the i386 version.     I spent weeks =
out at the IBM Palo Alto Science Center doing work on this project.    I =
had managed to inadvertantly shutdown the main AIX/370 in the cluster =
(such is a problem when things get too transparent).     Of course, =
while I had experience using VM/CMS before (both at the University of =
Maryalnd and at Rutgers), I=E2=80=99d never really much dealt with the =
operations side of the 370.    But I found my way to a 3270 and typed =
=E2=80=9Cipl aix=E2=80=9D with at the command line with extreme =
optimism, but that was indeed all it took.
