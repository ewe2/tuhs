My main gripe about that is that I can't read the web when the router I'm trying to install won't work, keeping me from the needed web documentation ...

*Please* write your documentation in a way that allows you to generate (useful, readable!) PDF documents that I can download for offline viewing.  Believe it or not, I don't haul along a 300 mile cat-5 cable when I go sailing.  I still like to write code on the boat.  So much for Go :-P

And $GOD help everyone in the Caribbean trying to bootstrap their infrastructure right now.  How is your https://... documentation going to help them out?
