Hi, doesn't anybody know if there is a disk size limit on Unix 6? I wrote a
C program to create a file and it won't go above around 1.5Mb.  It doesn't
crash or report any errors but the file size never exceeds around that size.
 Maybe it's a disk size limitation?

Also, is it possible to add other devices? like using an ISO file perhaps.

Regards,

Andrew.
