I have fond memories of playing it on the GT-40, and if Andrew Hume is 
reading this he'll remember reverse-engineering the code and modifying it 
for three-play operation; I think Peter Ivanov also implemented reverse 
gravity...

Eventually DEC Field Circus stopped replacing GT-40 switch registers if 
they'd suspected that they were used for playing it :-)

The GT-40 had a primitive loader; it was Craig McGregor of the CSU (UNSW) 
who used it to download an 8-bit loader for things like Lunar Lander (I 
only wrote a simple "Life" program for it, using the light-pen).
