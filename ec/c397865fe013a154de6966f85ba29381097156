: If by "GUI" you mean a windowing system, and by "standard" you mean
: generally available, then I'd say the late 80s.  I started using X11R3
: on Interactive UNIX/386 in early 1990.  I'm sure I didn't count as an
: "early adopter".

I was using X10R4 on a Sun3/50 in 1987 or so.  I more commonly used
sunview in a similar time frame.  Sunview/OpenWindows has been
standard on Sun machines since that time.  It was surprising snappy
for a 50MHz 68k machine, so long as you didn't swap, but I digress.
There were similar offerings from DEC and I think HP in approximately
the same time frame.

It depends on what you mean by GUI I guess :-)
