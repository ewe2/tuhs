Subject: [TUHS] And, contacts in the UK or Europe?

[I feel like I'm spamming my own list]

I've tried to make contact with people in the UK that might have
copies of the UKUUG and EUUG newsletters: Peter Collinson,
Sunil Das, Bruce Anderson. No luck with this.

There are newsletters back to 1992 at http://www.ukuug.org/newsletter/
but I'm after the ones in the 1970s and 1980s. The current secretary
doesn't know about the earlier newsletters.

Who else can I contact?

Cheers, Warren
