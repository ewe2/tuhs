A bit off topic, but…

I’ve been researching modern macOS writing apps over the last few days. I was very surprised to find that almost all of them use Markdown as their primary format — not just for import/export, but as a storage format as well as a user interface. (Examples: Ulysses, Scrivener, ByWord.) It seems that Markdown and text files has become the gold standard in this particular class of app, even for folks who’d never use the command line. Granted, not all those apps expose the documents as normal, version-controllable files, but still, it’s pretty wild to see text formats be accepted again, at least in a narrow class of documentation-related tools.
