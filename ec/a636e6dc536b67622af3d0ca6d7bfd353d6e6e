Frankly, I don't remember what Rob did but you might want to poke around
the BBN archives too which Warren should also have.    Gurwitz might have
written something before the UCB code came about that used ftp.  At CMU we
used rsync between the UNIX boxes for files like the host table, (that
where rsync was originally written for those that's don't know); but how it
was kept up to date from the 10's -- I don't remember.   As Lars said, MIT
would have used ITS as its master before the DNS was birthed, but how the
UNIX boxes got it from there is unknown to me [Noel do you know?].

Thank you for reminding me and thanks for pointing me to gettable. I see <b=

that is a TCP client implementation of the RFC 811 NIC Internet <br>
Hostnames Server. Awesome. I will be writing about it.<br>
<br>
Just noticed the long-obsolete manpage has an error; it says:<br>
