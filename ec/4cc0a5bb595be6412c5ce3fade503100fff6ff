From Dorothy L. Sayers, _The Five Red Herrings_:

    The ticket-collector on the train was not helpful.
    [...] Certainly he had seen nobody remotely resembling the
    portrait of Gowan [a suspect with a very full black beard].
    Was there anybody at all like what Gowan would be if clean-shaven?
    Well, that was asking something, that was.  Had the Inspector
    any idea what a 'edge-'og would look like without its spikes?
    No, nor he didn't suppose nobody had, neither.  He was a
    ticket-collector, not a puzzle-picture expert. [...]
