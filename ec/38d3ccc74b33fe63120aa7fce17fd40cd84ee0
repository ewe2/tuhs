Looks like we've got a spurt of email in the PUPS mailing list. For those
unaccustomed to this, you might prefer to switch over to the digest version
which comes out at most twice a week. To do this, send mail to
majordomo at minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au with these lines in the email body:

	unsubscribe pups
	subscribe pups-digest

Cheers,
	Warren
