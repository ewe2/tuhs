I run my own mail server (OpenSMTPD + Dovecot) but I don't do any spam
filtering server-side. I filter my email client-side with procmail and
bogofilter.

Every message to any non-existing address gets thrown into a catch-all
mailbox. I download the contents of that mailbox daily, and feed them
straight to bogofilter as spam, which of course improves its accuracy...
