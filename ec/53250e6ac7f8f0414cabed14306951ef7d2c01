Somewhere, deep in Minnie's bowels, is the article I wrote, explaining 
exactly how to use icheck/ncheck/dcheck/clri etc.  I'm told it's saved the 
bacon of quite a few people (assuming it was savable at all).

It was drilled into us that the correct usage was:

# sync
# sync
# sync

This gives the disk buffers time to actually flush (the writes were merely 
scheduled, and were asynchronous).
