Interesting how the Rand Editor seems to have been the choice of many.
Perkin-Elmer (later Concurrent) based their in-house office automation 
software
("Paper Free in '83.") On dog-slow UniPlus SysIII (IIRC -- later MicroXelos
UniPlus SysV based I think) on 68000 cpu 8 mhz machines.  No virtual memory
a dog-crap slow video subsystem.

Of course I got a truck load of them when they dumped them and I used
them to do the two county wide newsfeed until the PC Unix stuff
became available.

The nice one I had was an XF200 MicroXelos box -- which was RARE.
It was a minitower without the graphics and with room for a pair of
80mb MFM drives.

Did one of 'em for system and user accts and one for partial newsfeed.

Digital had it then.  Don't you wish you could buy it now!
