A script that massages the data from the Met Office Shipping Forecast and
prints it into a named pipe which my MUA reads from.
http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/data/CoreProductCache/ShippingForecast/Latest
It's XML now, but when I started using this .sig the data looked like it
was coming from a system designed for distributing the forecast via telex.
(Radio telex to ships maybe?)
