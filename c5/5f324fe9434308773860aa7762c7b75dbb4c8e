While you probably _do_ have a real hardware problem with the broken
IC, I think that the red Parity Error light on first turn-on is normal
behavior.  The MOS memory comes up with random values, and about half
of them will have the wrong parity.  Some software routine must turn
off parity error detection and write a known data pattern (all 0's) to
each memory location.  I don't remember whether this is something that
is done by the boot ROM of an 11/34.
