Um, pardon me for asking the obvious question, but why not just configure
a few gigs of swap to give the OS some breathing room?

Most modern systems let you use a regular old file in the filesystem
for swap space, instead of having to repartition your disk and using a
dedicated partition. I'd be suprised if your *BSD box didn't let you do
that too.  It's a little slower, but a gazillion times more convenient.

Just a thought,
