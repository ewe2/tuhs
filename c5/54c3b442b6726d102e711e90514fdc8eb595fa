ISTR that the vaxen did have such things.  Or rather, I ran some BSD 780s
for several years and I don't remember having to set the date / time
every time I did a reboot.  They sat in a data center, so I may have never
done a cold boot from power on.  It was a LONG time ago now, so there's
undoubtedly lots that I just plain don't remember.

(There was an old USENET joke about how with the size of transistors going
down, pretty soon you'd be able to get an S/370 inside your watch. But
of course, as soon as you booted MVS on it, it would ask you to set
the time! :-)
