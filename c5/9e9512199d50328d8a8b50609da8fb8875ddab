That's kinda ironic. One of the biggest ticket items in the AUUG newsletters
from the early days was how you can get FORTRAN, BASIC or MACRO-11
running under V6 or V7. There were several compatibility shims for RT-11
to accomplish this in a number of different ways. It was a big deal for many
folks that needed to run their FORTRAN programs from a DEC OS, but
wanted / needed to run Unix....

It's clea*r* they'd forgotten the PDP-11 experience...

The macro-11 that was in 2BSD had its own companion linker that
was basically the same. It could link  in .OBJ files from other DEC tools
as well...  History repeated itself, eh?
