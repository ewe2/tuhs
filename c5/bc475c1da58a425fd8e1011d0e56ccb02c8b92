Indeed.  I'm currently trying to convince Netflix that the way to get the
most performance out of a NUMA machine is to boot a different kernel on
each NUMA domain.  One way we might demo that is on a 4 domain system
lock down 3 hypervisors and their guest OS to 3/4 of the NUMA domains 
and give the host kernel the 4th.
