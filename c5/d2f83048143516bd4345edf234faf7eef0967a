To be fair.. The number of installs I did on SCO boxes and such far, far 
outnumbered those of A/UX ones. 

They were pretty special in those days, not to mention horrendously expensive 
if you compared a fully loaded IIfx with A/UX to a 486 with SCO UNIX, even on 
a decent Compaq.

SCO being pretty much the bread&butter of most small to medium companies
at that time to run things like their accounting software and such across 
many remote terminals (either actual ones or other PC's telnetting in..).
