SCO has packed so much FUD around this issue.  If Novell did anything to help
it made SCO clarify their posistion.

Another good thing that came out of this mess is the neat-o table embedded in
this page:

http://www.opensource.org/sco-vs-ibm.html

That shows AIX (and XENIX/SCO) in relationship to other systems.

Search for "Relationships among the Unix variants at issue"

It does leave out AIX 2 on ROMP.
