Sure, but help with the easy [and medium - not every function's
signature is as simple as read()] stuff helps you not break your
concentration to go look at documentation if you're not 100% sure you
remember the signature correctly, so you can use your brain more
efficiently for the hard stuff.

I use a Java IDE that will, with a single command, generate a
declaration corresponding to the type of an expression I just assigned
to an undeclared variable. This saves typing [in the easy cases] and it
saves thinking about return types [in the medium cases].
