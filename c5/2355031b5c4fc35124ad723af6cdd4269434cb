Subject: [TUHS] question about V7 ls(1) vs. sys/stat.h and ls.c
Message-ID: <200305220924.h4M9OPki011867@localhost.localdomain>

Greetings all.

The V7 ls(1) man page says that the -s option, which prints total
blocks, includes any indirect blocks.

However, the V7 struct stat didn't have the st_blocks member in the
struct stat, and the code in ls.c uses

	long
	nblock(size)
	long size;
	{
		return((size+511)>>9);
	}

So, is this just a case of the man page being mistaken?

When did the struct stat acquire the st_blocks member?

While I'm at it, the V7 ls -a option only adds . and .. to the
list; apparently all other dot files were printed by default.
When did ls change such that -a applied to all dot files?

Thanks,

Arnold Robbins
