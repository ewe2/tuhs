This is a feature of vi.   If the baud rate is perceived to be at or less than a specific value (1200 IIRC) the screen is set to 8 lines at a time to keep repainting low. 

This was useful on dialup lines.  

Since you have a virtual serial port the baud rate has no bearing other than upper level applications trying to make inferences about the environment such as this. 

If you set the baud rate to 19200 or 38400 (EXTA and EXTB in the virgin V7 code base) those were the fastest serial speeds in those days. So any SW should infer the ‘best’ behavior.

Using the j and k keys work better and when I scroll down enough lines, the lines move up to fill the whole terminal window and the file can be edited in the full window. Is there a better TERM setting that will get 24 lines to show up on file open?
