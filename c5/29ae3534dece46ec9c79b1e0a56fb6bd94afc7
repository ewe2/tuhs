From somewhere that didn't fit in well with Unix.
Its saving grace is piping info(1) made it just dump all the text,
skipping its UI, e.g.  `info gcc | less'.  Because it used to print
formatting progress to stderr!?, it used to need less's `G' then `g' to
skip to the end, getting all the formatting work out of the way, and
then back to the start to redraw the screen, dumping the stderr.
