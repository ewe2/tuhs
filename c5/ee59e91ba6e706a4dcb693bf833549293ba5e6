I'd have to check the chronology but I'm fairly sure that EINE predates Gosling Emacs by several years: I'd assume that either EINE is where Gosling got the idea, or that it was just obvious, since Emacs came from an environment where implementing things in Lisp was not a strange idea, to put it rather mildly.

(Note I agree that Gosling Emacs is the root of Emacs-on-Unix and that without that Emacs would likely have died out with the platforms it lived on.)
