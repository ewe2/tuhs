I just remembered that I had received a copy of a file note (50+ pages) =
that Greg Chesson wrote in 1982 about the "CMC=E2=80=9D control software =
for Datakit. I think it covers the same ground as the 1979 paper, but in =
far greater detail and with two more years of development. In short, the =
connection protocol in CMC is based on the exchange of binary messages. =
That was replaced (for the most part) by text-based messages in the =
later TDK control software.

It is here (it is a 16MB pdf):

https://www.jslite.net/notes/dk3.pdf

To compare, here are the first two design documents on sockets. I looked =
for these for many years (even had the Berkeley library manually search =
the boxes with CSRG documents that Kirk McKusick had sent there - to no =
avail), and then in 2021 Rich Morin found them in the papers of Jim =
Joyce. I=E2=80=99m still very thankful for this.

These two papers were written in the summer of 1981 and circulated to =
the newly formed steering committee for what was to become 4.2BSD (note: =
~5MB pdf each).

The first is specifically on networking:

https://www.jslite.net/notes/joy1.pdf

The second outlines the overall ambitions for the new version (including =
a summary of the above document). It has an interesting view of John =
Reiser=E2=80=99s VM code in its section 3.17 as well:

https://www.jslite.net/notes/joy2.pdf

What was proposed is not quite the sockets we know, but the general =
direction is set and the reasoning is explained. Reading the Chesson and =
Joy paper side by side makes for an interesting comparison of thinking =
on these topics in the early 80=E2=80=99s.

Maybe they are worth storing in the TUHS archive.

Wbr,

Paul
