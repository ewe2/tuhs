Oops. That's right, no username & password, but you still need to bring 
it up and interact with it... accept, as you say, you can enter your sql 
as an argument to the executable. OK, I suppose ... grump, grump... Not 
quite what I was thinking, but I'd be hard pressed to argue the 
difference between creating a handful of files in the filesystem (vs 
tables in sqlite) and then using some unix filter utilities to access 
and combine the file relations (vs passing sql to sqlite) other than, 
it'd be fun if there were select, col, row (grep?), join (inner, outer, 
natural), utils that worked with text without the need to worry about 
the finickiness of the database (don't stone me as a database 
unbeliever, I've used plenty in my day).

      What do you mean by "log into db's" in relation to SQLite?  I've
      never needed to enter a username and password to access SQLite.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you /do/ mean username and password, I believe that some DBs
      will allow you to authenticate using Kerberos.  Thus you should be
      able to streamline DB access along with access to many other
      things.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you /don't/ mean username and password, then what do you mean? 
      Are you referring to needing to run a command to open and access
      the SQLite DB?  Taking a quick gander at sqlite3 --help makes me
      think that you can append the SQL(ite) command that you want to
      run to the command line.
