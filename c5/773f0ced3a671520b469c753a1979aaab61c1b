they don't play any role, as the C language was defined decades ago. I lear=

before the ansi committee came to an end by Turbo C and soon later MS C, an=

various *NIX compilers. Recently I written a couple of linux programs using=

with exactly the same syntax I studied 30 years ago, and it works pretty co=

these programs are error free performing very fast while having a small mem=

footprint. For me there is nothing better than C, and I know a lot of langu=
ages.
