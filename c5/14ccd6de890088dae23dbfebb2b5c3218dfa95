There's a lot of fun and learning to be had besides doing an install.
An easy entry point encourags more people to learn the system and
get to the point where they could tackle an install of their own.

The script serves two purposes
1) it sets up a clean system
2) it documents the install process

you could also provide a pre-existing built system for
people to play with (which is also useful).  I personally
prefer the script.
