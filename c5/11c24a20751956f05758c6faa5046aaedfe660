Subject: [TUHS] short file names...

Erg!  Discussion of file name length brought back some chilling memories
of very early Unix, when file names were at most 6 characters long. 
Longer names were accepted but truncated at 6 characters.  So you could
edit ABCDE.c, store it, read it and edit it again, but the file system
knew it as "ABCDE."   So when you compiled the program, the compiler
produced ABCDE.o, which overwrote the source code!
