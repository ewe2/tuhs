Norman Wilson is the custodian of Tenth Edition. He would like to donate
a copy to the archives, but 10e contains quite a lot of material gathered
from many places, and the task of tracking down all the copyright owners
and getting permission would be an arduous task. Norman reads the list, so
he may respond with a more detailed comment.
