I think it might actually predates 6/1/80 by  6-9 months because I was at
Tek a year earlier and you and I started corresponding that first summer I
was at Tek.  I remember that you had sent me a copy of it shortly after you
wrote it.  So I think there is a chance that that might be a slightly later
version.
