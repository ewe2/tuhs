Subject: [TUHS] Oldest Unix source code still in modern systems
Message-ID: <20120521051801.GA2210@minnie.tuhs.org>

I was doing a trawl of related Unix source trees, and found that some early
C code from around 2nd Edition Unix is still in OpenSolaris today:

http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V2/cmd/if.c

Choose: Compare this file to OpenSolaris_b135/cmd/fmli/sys/test.c
and then click on the Side Scroll or the Printable button.

There's about 15 lines of code in common between the 2 files.

Cheers,
	Warren
