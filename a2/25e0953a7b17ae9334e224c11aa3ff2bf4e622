I write all my quick references in plain nroff since many years.  There are=
 gui editors, gui viewers, and lots of cgi search engines && web viewers ev=

man' can do hyperlinks, which were the only advantage of techinfo in a remo=

can do man pages too.

that's true. In the early 90ths they forced us writing quick references wit=

o nroff because thats the UNIX style.
I know some of us don't like to hear that, but with regards to the gnu tool=

 man by techinfo  definitely wasn't.=20
