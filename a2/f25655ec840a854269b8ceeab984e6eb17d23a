The APIs were ever so slightly different because the authors were concerned about copyright infringement. libc calls had different argument orders or types and in general it was just off enough that you wanted to claw at the screen every time something went wrong.

Mach Ten ... this weird BSD thing that runs on top of Classic Mac OS.  I 
actually have a minivmac image on my Linux box that it boots and runs on!

I used it as my "UNIX workstation" Until I finally got my hands on a 
Sparc in the late '90's.
