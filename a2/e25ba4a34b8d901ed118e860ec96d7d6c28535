As something sorta, kinda like a proof by contradiction, I work in an RF 
lab.  A fair amount of effort is put into writing code to control lab 
gear to automate data collection, reach confidence level, etc.

For one project the customer required that it be written in Java.  Most 
RF lab gear and radios use I/Q (in-phase/quadrature) signals and the 
associated math is complex.  Try doing complex DSP in Java and you will 
soon sing the praises of Fortran where it's a snap.  :-)
