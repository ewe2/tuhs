In general I agree with you.  But the "we should never" ignores the fact
that we do.  It's a complicated problem.  A major component is that
our "legal" system allows companies to externalize their liabilities.
And it's difficult to come up a way to assign liability without severely
harming the open source world.  As I've said before, if your car crashed
as often as your Windows you probably wouldn't keep buying from the same
manufacturer.

Part of my preferred process is to have two software review teams.  One
has access to the source code, the other doesn't.  But of course this is
now often not possible when companies used closed-source components that
they purchase.

As someone who agrees with Feynman's dissent on the Challenger commission,
I think that incremental improvement is a good way to go.  But, we live in
an age where many folks would rather come up with something bloated and new
rather than build on what's come before.  That's making it more and more
difficult to distinguish between "full stack" and a landfill.
