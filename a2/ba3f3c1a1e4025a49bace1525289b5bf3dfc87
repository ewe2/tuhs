Another thing that comes to mind was my late wife's roommate when she
was a contractor at either Bell Labs, AT&T or Bellcore back in the
late 80's to 1990 or so...

There was a rumor about undercover Narcotics cops inside the facility
going through desks and such at night.
Her officemate, who was a non-drug user -- but concerned about civil
liberties and privacy put two plastic bags of unknown substances in
his desk.

One leafy substance named catnip -- containing catnip.  One powdery
substance labeled sugar (which if I remember correctly was some kind
of confectioners sugar.

Shortly after that the substances disappeared from his drawer...  ( I
think some personnel did shortly after that as well.)

I can imagine the results of the lab tests coming back.  Perhaps this
info ran wide enough that some folks remembered this incident.
