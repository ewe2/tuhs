That's around the time when I first started dabbling in C. One of the
first things I figured out was that it was a great help to ignore all
errors but the first one if I got a slew of errors during compilation;
figure out how to fix that first one, recompile, and see if the other
errors went away. Usually, they did. Thankfully, the programs I was
working on at the time were small, so compilation time wasn't an
issue.

I think that advice was even in one of the books I was (trying to)
follow.
