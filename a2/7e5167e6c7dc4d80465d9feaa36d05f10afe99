Thanks for highlighting this!

The realm here is async I/O to disk, my original scope was limited to =
=E2=80=9Ccommunication=E2=80=9D files (tty=E2=80=99s, pipes, network =
connections). Still, I find it an interesting topic.

For others, the paper that you refer to can also be found here:
=
https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Documentation/TechReports/Heinz_Tech_Memos/UN=
IX_on_a_Microprocessor_19780322.pdf
If I read correctly, the async functionality was available only in the =
stand alone program version of LSX. Is that correct? In any case, the =
source code appears lost.

=46rom another paper in that set, I get the impression that the async =
functionality for LSX builds on earlier work for a very early version of =
Unix:
=
https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Documentation/TechReports/Heinz_Tech_Memos/TM=
-74-1352-1_Implementation_of_Large_Contiguous_Files_and_Asynchronous_IO_in=
_UNIX_19740104.pdf

- - -

When reading through the papers in that TUHS directory, something else =
caught my attention: early networking at the labs. For a while I have =
been puzzled by the =E2=80=9Cserial I/O loop=E2=80=9D in use at the labs =
in the early seventies. Last Fall I found some 1970/1971 BSTJ papers =
about it, but there it stopped.

I see in the memo on Glance =
(https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Documentation/TechReports/Heinz_Tech_Memos/T=
M-75-1352-3_GLANCE_Terminals_on_UNIX_Time-Sharing_19750303.pdf) that =
D.R. Weller continued to work on it up to 1973 at least and that it was =
integrated with Unix in some way. Is that correct? Did the two memo=E2=80=99=
s referred to (MM 70-1384-1 and TM 73-1356-8) survive?

Then the memo on satellite processors is very interesting =
(https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Documentation/TechReports/Heinz_Tech_Memos/T=
M-78-3114-2_A_Minicomputer_Satellite_Processor_System_19780322.pdf). =
This appears to show the serial I/O loop in use as late as 1978, with a =
very intriguing use case involving system call forwarding over the =
network.

Can you tell me more about the serial I/O loop and its use cases?
