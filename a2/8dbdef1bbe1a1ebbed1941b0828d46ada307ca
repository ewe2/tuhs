Hey All,

I just saw in another thread the statement their are no odd requests here.

So I thought I would test that.

The day NeXT took over Apple I read a page somewhere on the internet that started with line.


Bow down to UNIX children of Macintosh... It then when on its Old Testament conquering tone about the new way of computing that was coming.


Does anybody have any idea who wrote this or where to find it?

Thanks,
Ben
