Yes, same. Also see note from Ritchie: "tar was done by C. B. Haley 
while he was here at BTL in the research group.  This is my memory, and 
is confirmed by his web page."

(I don't see on his webpage though. and the old page isn't on the

contributors I interviewed, I think he is the only one to tell me he 
wasn't interested in participating.)

BSD releases and don't see any of these. (I have heard from some of them 
though.)

This is awesome.

By the way, a list of the people I contacted from around 4.0 and 
earlier is at 
http://reedmedia.net/books/bsd-history/tmp-pre-mid-1980-people

If you are curious ...

t1:bsd-history$ wc -l PEOPLE # notes and contact details
    8004 PEOPLE
t1:bsd-history$ grep ^== PEOPLE | wc -l                                        
     452
t1:bsd-history$ find interviews/ -type f | grep -v my-letters | wc -l
      95
t1:bsd-history$ grep bibitem generated/book.bbl | wc -l
     221
t1:bsd-history$ grep "\cite{" svn-bsd-history/*tex | wc -l 
    1282
t1:bsd-history$ grep CITE: svn-bsd-history/*tex | cut -d : -f 2- | sort | uniq | wc -l
     190
(left to add bibtex entries for)
