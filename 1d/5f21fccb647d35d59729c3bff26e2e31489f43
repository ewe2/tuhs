Well, no.  Inline code doesn't need to be debugged over and over.  It doesn't
have to be written from scratch every time.  While in theory your point about
libraries is correct, it hasn't seem to have worked out in practice.  Better
in C than in node.js, but there have been plenty of spectacular bugs found in
old C libraries recently.
