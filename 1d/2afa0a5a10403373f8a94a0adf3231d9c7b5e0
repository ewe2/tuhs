"#" as the root prompt predates # as the comment in the Bourne shell,
not to mention predating copy/paste entirely. (My understanding is that
the do-nothing command, ":" was used for comments. Talk about minimalist!)

Same point for ">", since copy/paste didn't exist in the late 70s when
Bourne was doing the shell, it wasn't an issue.
