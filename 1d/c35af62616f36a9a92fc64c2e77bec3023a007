As an alternative to doing it by hand, you can compile and install my
Apout user-mode simulator, then run a PDP-11 ar inside Apout. This gives
you direct access to your normal filesystem, which makes extraction easier.

The latest Apout can be found in the svn snapshot here:
http://code.google.com/p/unix-jun72/downloads/list

You will also need to grab some V7 binaries, at least /bin/sh and /bin/ar,
from http://minnie.tuhs.org/Archive/PDP-11/Distributions/research/Henry_Spencer_v7/v7.tar.gz

Cheers,
