I thought about it a while back, but the potential for OCR errors is high,
and so too the frustration level. I'd say, only if someone was to fund the

the s2 tape in the PDP-11/Distributions/research/1972_stuff area contains
userland binaries and libraries from 1972, so there's a strong possibility
that the kernel in the PDF document would be able to execute the binaries.
