​The fun story on that Warner is after years of dogged defense of RMS, when
C was written for VMS, Cutler had to add Stream I/O.   The moment is was
released, much (?most?) of customer base (including a lot of internal folks
like the compiler runtime and DB folks) switched to using it.   It was so
much easier.​  I never heard Dave back down, but it I used to smile when I
saw the statistics.
