Good stuff. Thanks. I was able to do the install in ESXi 5 with no 
problems using this information. Has anyone gotten the networking setup? 
There is an Intel PRO/1000 NIC driver package on the SCO site (ptf4016c) 
but it is for UW2.1.3 only and I was not able to get it to go. Sadly, the 
original 2.1 package ptf4016a appears to be gone. I suppose the next step 
would be to run through the updates from 2.1 to 2.1.3 unless someone else 
can share a simpler way to bring up a NIC.
