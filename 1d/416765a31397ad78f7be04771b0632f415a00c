(Not receiving a reply back then, I'm going to ask again.  My apologies for 
any inconvenience.)  wotthehell, I'm going to ask anyway.

Soemtime during the late 1980s, Clarkson U., came out with a GPLed MS-DOS word 
processor package called Galahad, released under the Galahad Public License, 
which is a rebadged GNU Emacs Public License.  I've sent them the CS 
Professor an email requesting the source.

I was wondering if anyone on this list might have the sources, because as yet 
I've had no reply.

Thanks

Wesley Parish
