Not an answer to your questions, but you may want to take a look
at the PCC Revived project.  It lives in CVS, but I have a git mirror at
git://github.com/arnoldrobbins/pcc-revived

That compiler is LP32, not ILP32 - which may be a source of trouble. Just changing the SZINT parameter yielded some issues, so I started looking at the PCC source.

Instead it uses a file “stin” which appears to be in a more compact format and is translated into a “table.c” file by a new pre-processor ("sty.y”). Then looking at the VAX compilers for 8th and 10th edition, these too use this “stin” file.
