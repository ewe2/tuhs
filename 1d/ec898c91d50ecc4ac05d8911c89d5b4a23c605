Control-T in TOPS-10 was done straight out of the monitor. If you were 
on a slow 300 baud or 110 baud terminal on say a DZ11*, and kept hitting 
Control-T really fast, you'd slow down everything else on the machine as 
there was no buffering of serial TTY I/O and the monitor would sit and 
wait for each character to be transmitted.

ak

* a DZ11 is UNIBUS and was only available on a KS10 - but I'd imagine 
any straight serial port on a KA/KI/KL10 would do the same. If you were, 
say, on a DCA mux, that had a 14.4K serial link straight into the 
UNIBUS, there was much less of an effect.
