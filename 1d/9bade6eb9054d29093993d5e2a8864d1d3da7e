This reminds me of Western Digital's recent OmniXtend.  It takes a
programmable Ethernet switch and changes the protocol: Ethernet becomes
OmniXtend.  It's a cache-coherency protocol the allows CPUs, custom
ASICs, FPGAs, GPUS, ML accelerators, ... to each hang off an 802.3 PHY
and share one memory pool.

It might be a step towards a room of racks being marshalled as a single
computer.
