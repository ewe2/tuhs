For the record, I'd be a little careful with what you state here.
I've been here for a while and there has been stuff flying by that 
makes me cringe.

I'd like Unix to be free too, see

but I also respect copyright and other IP laws.

I'm somewhat alarmed by what's flying by.  Not from you, John, but others.
Like it or not, those companies have rights.  And also for the record,
I looked over the code in the SCO thing, and they were right IMHO.
Just too stupid to prove it.
