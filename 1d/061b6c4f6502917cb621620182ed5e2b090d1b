I don't even remember a drum for any UNIBUS system.   We had a RF-11 fixed head disk on our PDP-11/45 and augmented that with a "bulk core" box that looked like the RF-11 to the system as well.

Drums were usually fixed head, although those UNIVACers out there will remember the Fastrand drums which had flying head.   Massive units looked like 6' lengths of sewer pipe covered in iron oxide.
It was sort of the basis of UNIVAC storage units.
