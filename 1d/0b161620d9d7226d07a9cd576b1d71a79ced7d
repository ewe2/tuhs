As far as I understand it, the Berkeley FFS didn't appear
until much closer to 4.2; it was definitely not in 4.1 and
was likely not in 4.1a.

Which would explain why V8 would have still had the 14 character
filename limit.

ISTR that System V picked this up at some point also, although I don't
recall if the bigger block size was 1K or 4K.  I may be misremembering
though.

Thanks,
