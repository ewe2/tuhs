Hello again from Gregg C Levine
Here are those questions:
1) What is the status of networking, with regards to the boot images?
2) Has anyone actually managed to dump the image that's contained within the
Soupnik collected UNIX versions to an actual disk?
3) Has anyone actually managed to build a kernel from that source code?
Either native, and on a Simh setup will do.
