Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.11.1512171609190.860@aneurin.horsfall.org>

Ken Iverson was born in 1920; he is (in)famous for inventing APL.  And if 
you haven't used APL\360 on a dumb Kleinschmidt[*] terminal, you didn't 
miss anything.

[*]
And that's the first time I've seen a spell-checker suggest that it be 
replaced with "Consummated".
