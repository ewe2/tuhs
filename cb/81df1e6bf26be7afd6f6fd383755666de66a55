I'm not surprised. Considering SCO's pricing policy (ever looked at
that? They charge for every little bit of configuration above and be-
yond, say, Sony PS2 multiplayer environment, like extra users, more
memory, more processors, ..., uname it, they charge for it), the place
looks more and more like a dominion of marketing folks, and lawyers,
with the latter no longer being considered a defense entity against
unfriendly intrusion, but rather a business division, expected to
generate substantial revenue. If a company trades innovative head-
count (i.e. developers and engineers) for headcount unaware, or un-
familiar with the prime business objective, then the second rate
headcount will come up with many "interesting" schemes to justify
their continued employment.

I might be overdoing it just so. But then I have seen this happen
thrice during my career, so there is a pattern.

Thank you for listening to a not-too-old man rambling ;)

Regards,

Cornelius
