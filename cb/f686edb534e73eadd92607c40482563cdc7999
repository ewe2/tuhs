Precisely. It worked too, at some cost in our time. The DEC salespeople were =
willing to put their lie in writing, you see ...

One of those 8650s was "apple.com" (host) for quite a number of years, as the =
11/780 before it: DNS primary NS for the domain, SMTP server, NTP server (VAXen =
had decent, low-drift hardware clocks), UUCP/USENET host (as "apple" in that =
world), NNTP server - it was our public face to the world. I was given the =
explicit mandate to make it so when I was hired in 1988.

Unix was the OS for a wide range of facilities within Apple. Probably still =
is (I've been gone from there since 1997, but I still hear from folks within =
from time to time). As hardware got cheaper and more capable, other systems =
were added to the mix to provide anonymous FTP (ftp.apple.com started as a =
Mac IIci running A/UX under my desk), HTTP service, and so on.

The main thing that changed over time was what hardware (and version of Unix) =
we were running for whatever task or service (the RISC bloom was wonderful to =
see, even if the vendors tried bending Unix in to a proprietary lock-in thing =
- it's rather sad that we're mostly stuck with the awful x86 ISA after all =
that), and the overall character of the system use. When I arrived, Unix was =
used as a now-classical interactive timesharing system (with Macs as terminals =
- does anyone else remember the wonderful "UnixWindows" multi-windowing =
terminal emulator for MacOS, with its associated Unix back-end?), and by the =
time I left, Macs were TCP/IP hosts (peers) themselves, speaking as clients =
(IMAP, NNTP, HTTP) over our networks to Unix machines as servers.
