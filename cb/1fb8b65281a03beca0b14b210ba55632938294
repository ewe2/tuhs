Were there really that many comments that needed censoring?  It would be
nice to have the idealism to think of Sun as a freewheeling, uncensored
alternative to the corporate structure of DEC and IBM, but having seen the
"released" source for the early '90s Unix operating systems of all three I
never saw anything to indicate that there were censored inline curses
anywhere.  If anything, the DEC sources are now more informational by
virtue of still having a mostly complete changelog in the header.
