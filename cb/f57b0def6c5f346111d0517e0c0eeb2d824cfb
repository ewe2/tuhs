physical copy of the original document (library search engine - The link above is for the RS-232 spec.)

Hi, all!
Sorry for slightly off-topic question, but do anybody have a copy of
original circa 1969 RS232C standard? I need it to resolve conflict with me
and my customer regarding if RS-232C REQUIRES the use of DE-25M connector or just
RECOMMENDS it? It seems that there is a lot of interpretations of this standard, but
no original document anywhere :(


I know it might cost $$$, but I will pay all needed fees.


All the best,

S.
