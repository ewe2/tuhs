Looking through that one again now :)

That site is the basis for what I have at the moment, though I hope to start 
tracking down and mailing people from vendors to get definate dates and to 
fill in the "gaps" pretty soon.

Yes, no problem at all.  I'll forward any results from vendors or other 
sources on to you :)

I have had something back from Caldera/SCO regarding XENIX , OpenServer, and 
UnixWare - both time-line and licensing.

I dont think they're confirmed dates - I'd have to boot back into WinDOHze to 
find out - I wish Lotus would write a "native" Notes client for UNIX.


There are a couple of "unknowns" on my list that I'd love to hear about - 
namely LSX (V6-based),  and MIPS OS (possibly BSD-based)...   MERT, RT and TS 
were on this list, but I see they're on the TUHS page :)

Paul
