Subject: [TUHS] Software Tools now in Wikipedia
Message-ID: <fac65aad-dc08-b606-078b-159f185a2ec9@solar.stanford.edu>

I rewrote the article on the Software Tools project and, thanks to Bruce 
Borden's efforts to upload, they accepted it within 1 day. You can see 
it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_tools_users_group

The Usenix article in Wiki is pretty thin, in case anyone would like to 
spiffy it up.
