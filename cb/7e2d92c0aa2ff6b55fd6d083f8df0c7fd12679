If I understand you correctly, approximately yes.

Entry points are usually defined as "foo$bar", where "foo" is the segment
name, and "bar" an entry point in the segment symbol table. I believe that
the degerate case of "foo$" is treated as "foo$foo" by the shell.

In the following example, the segment name is "hello", the entry point
"world".


*edm hello.pl1*
Segment not found.
Input.
*world: procedure options(main);*
*  dcl sysprint file output print stream;*
*  put list ("Multics rulez; UNIX droolz");*
*  put skip;*
*end world;*
*.*
Edit.
*w*
*q*
r 16:45 0.050 3

*pl1 hello*
PL/1 33e

r 16:45 0.128 36

*hello$world*
Multics rulez; UNIX droolz
r 16:45 0.033 23
