Hello from Gregg C Levine
I've got a question for those of you, who work more in that field then I.Has
anyone successfully gotten, say, NetBSD, or anything along the lines of the
4.4 series to run on a PDP-11? Granted I don't think it would work there,
because of the way its hardware was constructed. Or for that matter, say
Linux? Since the Simh collection builds easily on Linux, I was thinking that
it would be relatively simple to do so.
