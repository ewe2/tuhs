BTW, another reason that I like to run my own mail servers is so that I can
see "spam" in case it isn't.  While I'm sure that filtering tools have gotten
better I recall an issue some years ago while using a clients email address
where the message included a register layout like 0 1 1 X X X 0 1; the message
vanished because of the X X X.
