Subject: [TUHS] RFS (Remote? File System)
Message-ID: <20060514191901.Y6729@dynamite.narpes.com>


In the context of non-local file systems - Sun's NFS
in particular - I've seen RFS be mentioned.  This was
AT&T's implementattion of transparent real-time (for
contrast with UUCP, FTP, etc.) remote file access.

But that's all I know.  Does anyone know of useful
sources of information (or just anecdotes, for that
matter)?
