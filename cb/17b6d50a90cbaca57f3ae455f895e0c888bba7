teach courses that study 'style' and taste in CS."

Some time around 1970, Bob Rosen instituted a program-reading
course at the University of Iowa, by overt analogy to the
study of literature. Style was certainly a central concern;
I'm not sure about the deeper matter of taste. I'm not aware
of other examples, except perhaps for a collaboration between
Don Kunth and a teachaer of (I think) creative writing--a
course whose content I can't recall.
