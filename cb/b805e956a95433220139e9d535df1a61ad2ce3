 |Mailx doesn't do it now, so it probably didn't do it then.

It seems to have entered Mail not before 1988, when Edward Wang
replaced the fixed "\t" prefix with a "tabstr" variable (he
credits Tom Newcomb, newcomb at arpa, for this).  In 1989 he
changed "tabstr" to "indentprefix" and quotes "to be Sun
compatible".
