It's like 99% compatible.  The undo change bothered me a lot, I still
don't really 'get' vim's undo method even having mostly given up on
old vi about 10 years ago.  I'm sure it's better, if I ever got around
to learning it, but I agree with Clem, vim's 'enhanced unlmited undo'
should have moved to a different keybinding.

'vim' also moved the "increment number" command to a new key.

And the one that visually bothered me is 'cw' or 'c<anything>',
immediately removes the text that's going to be replaced.  I liked old
vi's way of leaving it there for you to type over.
