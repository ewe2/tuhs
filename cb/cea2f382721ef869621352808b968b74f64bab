A decent amount, at least for basic productivity software (accounting, etc.) 
and compilers and such. Nothing spectacular, but would have given at least 
an initial library of basic tools.

Ah.. Yes you are right.. De distribution tape only has XView. CDE I probably 
only saw on an in-house demo of. 

I remember it was terribly slow though, especially with the limited RAM 
capacity at the time of max 16MB and a 25Mhz '030, which was already showing
it's age by now and should really have been an '040 with the option
of (much) more RAM.

								Bye, Arno.
