Amen to that though I think our memory is clouded by V6 that was
uniprocessor, no networking.  With all due respect to Unix, that's
not a hard problem.   Systems today are more complex with SMP, NUMA,
networking, etc.

That has changed in the last decade or two.  Pugs did the work to expose
the IOMMU to user process and that has definitely blurred the line.

Thanks for your thoughtful email, I'm still absorbing it.
