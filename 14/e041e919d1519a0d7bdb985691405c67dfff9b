The Third edition was still written in assembly code. The Fourth edition
was the first to be rewritten in C. So there was a time when both
existed in parallel.

This code, from the nsys kernel, clearly shows this. The kernel was
being rewritten in C. The C version had not yet caught up with the
functionality in the assembly version of the kernel, which did have pipes.
