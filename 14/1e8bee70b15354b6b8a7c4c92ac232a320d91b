It is indeed a straight port of BSD 4.x, where x depends in whether is it's
RISC iX 1 or 1.2 (R440 used 4.2, I think; R260 used 4.3).

Take a look at James Carter's page at
http://www.jfc.org.uk/documents/riscix_clone.html

James and I worked this out when we rescued half-a-dozen R260's in various
states of disrepair and with various not-quite-complete copies of RISC iX.

It is a standard 4.3 filesystem (at least for the verison for an R260).  It
even says so when it boots:

RISC iX Release 1.2
ARM3 processor, cache enabled
...
...
Root fstype 4.3, name /dev/sd0a
Swap fstype spec, name /dev/sd0S
...


One of us could copy some stuff for you.  I'm not sure you'd be able to get
what you need onto a single floppy, though.  That's not how Acorn did it.

We'd certainly be willing to help, especially if you have any RISC iX stuff
we're missing.
