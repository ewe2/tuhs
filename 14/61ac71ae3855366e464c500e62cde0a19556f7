BEL *did* ring a bell on the model 33 Teletype.  On the DEC VT52, it
sounded a buzzer that was sort of like an electronic raspberry.  On
the VT100, LA36, and other later terminals, it was the familiar feep
sound.

The character we're discussing here was named LANTERN, not LAMP, but
you may have something there regarding it turning on a light.  We'd
need to find an AT&T 4410 terminal, or someone who's used one, to be
sure.
