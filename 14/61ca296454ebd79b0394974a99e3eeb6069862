Subject: [TUHS] Historic Linux versions not on kernel.org
Message-ID: <CANCZdfqcUiXtznQ2GLG1dnkiehATnZgUMP_X_f_piC83DA836Q@mail.gmail.com>

I have a ImageMagic CD that I got back in 1994 that I found in my
garage. It has a bunch of versions of linux that aren't on kernel.org.
The 0.99 series, the 0.98 series and what looks like 1.0 alpha pl14
and pl15.

Is anybody here interested in them?

I have fallen out of contact with the Linux folks, so don't know if
anybody on kernel.org would be interested in these. Does anybody care?
