Dave not doubt. Sorry. I didn't  publish.  FWIW Ted took that code back to  the USG though :-).  I've forgotten when the 34 was released. I think it was late 77 maybe early 78 but it was before 79 as the 34/A would have been by then. (I'll have to ask Jeff Mitchell who did the CPU if I see him anytime soon). 


BTW Because Gordon Bell was a CMU prof , we tended to have early DEC product. Urban legend is Bell  would match transistors to make the amplifiers by hand when he designed the for runner to 8 cpu. 

We had serial #1 of the Vax and our EE dept had serial #9 of the 8 and I fairly sure the 34 was under 10 too.  My memory is that was the summer of '77.  Danny Klein and I wrote the original RK07 driver for UNIX a year later because we had a very early one of those.

  Another infamous story of CMU and early processors was the KL10 in late 75/early 76.  DEC's site prep book for the KL series had not been written and CMU wired for a KA10 not know any better.  When DEC first powered up, it blew the main circuit in Science Hall putting us all in the bldg in darkness.  I was in the computer room when it went completely silent and dark - very strange.
