In the good old days at Sun, we were very focussed on who would run
this code for decades to come.  I think the engineers at Sun were very
focussed on helping people, the reason we were there was because the
work we did helped people.  The leverage was how much work we could
do versus how much that helped people.  That is product oriented.

I think the reason that any engineer works is because they feel like
their work helps someone.  As an engineer, I wanted to go to the place
and do the work that had the best chance of helping someone.  All of
Sun, when I was there, was like that.  We were there to help.  Yeah,
of course, we wanted to make money, but all of us wanted to help.
It's the dream, you do work, your work helps.
