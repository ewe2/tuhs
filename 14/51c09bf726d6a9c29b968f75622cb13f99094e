​Same here....​  I never fully understood what happened. I was friends with
all of them at the time and tried to stay out of the fight. BTW: I didn't
think it was USENIX as much as a couple members of the CSRG/BSDi crew.   I
know of couple of the folks that he did battle, but not the details nor did
I want to know.

​From a historical perspective, Bill & I wrote the original AT disk
interface code for 386BSD - I was consulting the chief arch if NCR who was
doing their first x86 systems at the time.  For those interested in early
UNIX ports, particularly to the 386 check out the DDJ articles.
