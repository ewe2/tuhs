I like shell scripts for hard to remember things like that.

Call it wget_mirror.sh or something like that:ï»¿

#!/bin/bash

if [ $# -ne 1 ] ; then echo ERRR; exit 1 ; else url=$1 ; fi

wget -c -m -k -np -e robots=off $url


( that was off the top of my head and has NOT been tested ... it might have a typo or two :)
