And of course it is in TUHS! Remember we have 32V and SIII. For example,
look into 

	TUHS/Other/Distributions/Plexis_Sys3/
or
	TUHS/PDP-11/Distributions/usdl/SysIII/

The sources contain 'bs' under cmd/bs

The latter one (under USDL) contains also the man page under usr/src/man/man1
(as 'bs.1').

So, there. You have it.

This leads me to consider we would greatly benefit from an expanded and
indexed TUHS repository tree. I made one on my mirror long ago, but a
series of disk crashes ended with it. Maybe, if there is interest I
could do it again.
