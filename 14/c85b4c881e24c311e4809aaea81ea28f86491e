Yep, an old trick.  Trouble is, whenever I rearranged the cards I had to
use another colour, and then had to remember which...

I've seen something like that; it involved a high-speed CDC reader/punch, 
as I recall.  Cards everywhere :-)  Seems that the deck wasn't 
straightened before inserting by the trainee operator.  Pity the poor 
user.

Have you any idea how fast the IBM 1403 printer can slew blank pages?  
Cough cough...  It chewed through a box in an instant, and I got to 
re-pack it afterwards.  You also learned to not place your coffee cup on 
it (I was doing the midnight shift at the time), because when it ran out 
of paper then the door would open automatically...

I think it was because of an undefined format control character, and the 
printer's control tape went hunting for it.

Closest I've ever been murdered was when I "accidentally" filled the local 
11/70 with an uninterruptible instruction sequence.  And who here hasn't 
"tried out" that self-reproducing program?  The only way to recover was to 
switch it off, as the HALT key was implemented as an interrupt, and guess 
what it wasn't doing at the time?

Try writing a self-reproducing program some time i.e. one that creates an 
exact copy of itself; it's an exercise in computer science, and is not as 
easy as it sounds.
