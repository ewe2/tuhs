I ran both FreeBSD (up through at least 4.11 (and have the Tshirt) and 
NetBSD back in the 0.8 0.9 time frame.  My final -- (I used to move 
between them based on stability and driver support) -- move to Linux was 
caused by a lack of drivers for the Lenovo Workstation that used the 
Marvell 88SE63XX which with 5 SAS/SATA drives on it and 3 available on 
the Intel SATA controller would've been a great in-house server.

I really preferred the FreeBSD stability and docs back in the early 
1990's -- but by 2000 my jobs were all going Linux (Red Hat Sysadmin 
mostly) and I figured the work was moving to supported RHEL.  One of the 
things that often made me migrate was the support (in the early days) of 
all the weird interfaced cdrom drives like the Panasonic and other 
pre-ATAPI stuff.

I'm going to revisit the ZFS on Linux stuff when Ubuntu puts it in their 
installer.  That will finally get me what I want on the D20.
