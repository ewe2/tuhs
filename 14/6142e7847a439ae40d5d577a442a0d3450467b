Note I have not tried this .... but from the simh mailing list:

  * The UNIBUS DH11 and DHU11 had 16 lines per interface
  * The QBUS DHV11 had 8 lines per interface
  * The QBUS CXY08 was DHU/DHV compatible and had 8 lines
  * The QBUS CXA16  "    "   "    "   "    "   "  16 lines

*Supposely, the DHV11 works ..... its been on my >>round tuit<< list for a

Yeah, but since the 780 was slow on interrupt processing, why stress it any
more thsan you have too.

No doubt.   CMU and MIT had front ends that put the serial lines on
dedicated PDP-11s in front of the 10's - so the Tops (or ITS) only saw
canonicalized I/O and it made a huge difference for those systems.  By the
time Vaxen, I don't think DEC had yet realized what a problem the DZ was.
 The DH's issue was cost (and space) since it was implemented in MSI TTL
and took up a full 'PDP-11 System Unit' on the bus.  The DZ11 gave you 8
serial ports in a single PDP-11 slot, which was a huge win.
