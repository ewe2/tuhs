Dennis spent quite a bit of time cleaning up the troff code in the late
1980s, if I remember right, moving it to modern C. He got annoyed by it one
day. It was the "ditroff" variant although honestly I don't remember us
ever calling it that. It was just the current version of troff. Not sure
where the name came from. Perhaps it was us but I think of it as a foreign
name.
