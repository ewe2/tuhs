Aw, I loved TECO - so much so that I wrote a version for every platform 
I used after that until I got into consulting for various different 
companies that used UNIX's of various flavors.

At some point in that transition, I learned vi. Now I wouldn't do 
without it.

The only detrimental thing about TECO to me, was that it was used to 
start off EMACS. ;)
