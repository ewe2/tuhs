This is quite interesting to me. A while ago I looked into building a spell
checker for Gujarati (a Sanskrit based language) and found it to be a
complicated affair -- words can have multiple suffixes since the Guj.
equivalents of from/to/in/ etc prepositions are tacked on at the end of
a word. But the same endings can also appear in normal words. And
there are other complications.... Even though the language is phonetic,
mistakes of using the wrong form of long/short vowel signs are common.
After reading your paper I am tempted to revive the effort.
