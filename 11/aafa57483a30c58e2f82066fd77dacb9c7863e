Subject: [pups] Searching for 8" DSDD drive
Message-ID: <20011105160219.B85031@cs.waikato.ac.nz>

Hi PDP owners,

we are looking for someone with access to a working 8" DSDD floppy
disk drive, presumably running RT or RSX on the PDP system. This is
to retrieve some very interesting historic material regarding the
Internet. As some of you may know, the IMP's in the 1980s, or fuzzball
systems, were running PDPs.

The actual floppies to be read are in Delaware, anyone close there
would be a big bonus.

Thank you.
	Joerg
