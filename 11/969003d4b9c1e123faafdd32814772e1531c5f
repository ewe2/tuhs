You could be right there, for some value of 1988 (FreeBSD came into
being in 1992).  The tools work without being good.  But how often do
you use them?  I've been using FreeBSD since the beginning, and I
can't recall when I last used the disk partitioning tool, though I'm
sure that when I did I overrode a lot of (all?) the suggestions.

FWIW, I find Microsoft "Windows" installation terminally confusing
(that's what you were talking about, right?).  And I've run into
serious problems with various Linux installations too.  That doesn't
make the FreeBSD tools better, but maybe it relativizes it.

The FreeBSD installer *does* install X if you select it.

You're still talking about the installer, aren't you?  The normal user
interface is via the shell, which hasn't changed, and for a good
reason.

There I have to agree with you.  A little TLC would go a long way.
But I hope that you're not advocating the "change your GUI with your
underwear" attitude that Microsoft, Apple and many Linux distros
have.  One of the reasons I don't use Linux is because every time I
try, the interface has changed.
