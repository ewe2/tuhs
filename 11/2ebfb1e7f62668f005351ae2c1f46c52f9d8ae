Jim / Nick,  That's kinda my problem: can't find enough documentation on
2.10 to ascertain if I can / should run it. I know 2.9 is OK for the 11/34,
but 2.9 doesn't have telnet or ftp and I want this machine to be easily
reachable on the net.

  From what I've read, 2.11 is right out except for the little glimmer of
hope in the docs that it "would probably only require a moderate amount of
squeezing to fit on machines with less memory, but it would also be very
unhappy about the prospect," which I think roughly translates to, "don't
try it on a puny thing like an 11/34."

  I wonder if porting telnet and ftp to 2.9 on the 11/34 would be my best
hope?  But with a much more antique tcp stack, it sounds daunting.
