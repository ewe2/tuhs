I think it's more of a "How dare anyone even think licensed code was
lifted?  We all know better than that. I'm gonna show you that you don't
even have a leg to stand on."

Whatever.  Anyone with any sense knows that SCO hasn't got much ground
to stand on.  Sadly, "anyone with any sense" likely doesn't cover
the judge and the jury.

Sigh.  (Fade to black, as Dionne Warwick sings "Deja Vu" in the
background...)
