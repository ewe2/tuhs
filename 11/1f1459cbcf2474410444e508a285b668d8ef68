There already is a project that revived PCC, probably starting
with the one in 4BSD.

	http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/

I have a git mirror, just to make things easier for access through
firewalls:

	https://github.com/arnoldrobbins/pcc-revived

Starting from the V10 compiler would be interesting. It was not available
when the above project was started.

HTH,

Arnold
