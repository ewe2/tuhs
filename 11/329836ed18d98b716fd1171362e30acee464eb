well spec=E2=80=99ed machines where more common in the past. we had all the s=
ource for the interdata 3210 at college.

we had the edition 7 source, the driver source, the diagnostic tape source, a=
nd even  all the schematics.

two of the lecturers even upgraded it from 1mb to 4mb of RAM, complete with a=
ddress decoders on their backs with their legs in the air.
