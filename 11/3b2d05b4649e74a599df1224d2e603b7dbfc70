This may have been answered and I missed it while I was out weedwacking
but have you gotten to a point where you can rebuild the world and install
your newly built stuff?

At Sun this was called "make bootstrap" but I bet that predates Sun.  The
bootstrap process, as I remember it, had the compiler build the compiler,
then the new compiler built the kernel and userland, then there was an
install step, and presto, you were running on bits you had built yourself.
All of them.
