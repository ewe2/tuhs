Message-ID: <412565BB.0036DA5F.00@notestest.mail.abb.com>

Hi,
I was given an PDP-11/84 but I have no idea what OS it has installed.
It says this when it starts up:

        Testing in progress - Please wait
                 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
            starting system

It has controlled the ventilation system on a hospital of that can be of
any help.
Anyone knows what OS this could be?

And another thing. This machine had a Wangtek 5150EQ tape streamer. If I
look
at the cables it seems to be SCSI. And the controller for the streamer is
not manufactured
by DEC. (There's no DEC logo on it at least.)
It says B 01079 ISS.4 1984 CTS-11 CKK 3890 on the board. Is this a SCSI
controller board?
Can I connect SCSI disks to it or is it a streamer only interface?
There're some (bad quality) pictures of the board at
http://spektr.ludvika.se/museum/pics/pdp11-board1.jpg

There's a switch on the front of the CPU box that says "AUX ON | OFF".  And
on the back of
the PSU there's a switch that says "remote | off | local". What function do
they have?

Thanks!

It looks like a version of RSTS/E to me (but that's mainly because I
know it isn't RT-11 or RSX-11...)

It's almost certainly a QIC-02 controller, probably doing TS11 emulation.
The sure way to test if its doing TS11 emulation or not is to drop into
console ODT and see if there's something living at the TS11 CSRs at
17772520.

These control the 3-wire DEC power controller bus.

Warren may want to correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't non-Unix issues
like these best taken to forums such as vmsnet.pdp-11 and comp.os.rsts ?

That's excellent news, Dion. I'll cc this to the PUPS mailing list.

I would think that you should add MasterCard to that list, possibly
instead of Amexco.

Where do we go from here?  Can we start to bombard you with
license applications?

Dion sent me this suggestion:

	So I guess what we have is this:
	1. Prospective licensee gets the license from [PUPS] website.
	2. He signs and sends to SCO and sends his $100 to SF PO box.
	3. Someone here [at SCO] lets [PUPS] know that he is a licensee.
	4. [PUPS] can send him the source code  (and charge a fee for that
   	   as you see fit).

SCO wants the license on paper. I asked him for the final license in a
form suitable for printing, e.g PostScript, PDF, Word format (gasp!).

Greg's suggestion about MasterCard went to Dion as well. I guess we just
have to sit back & wait until we get the word (and the final license)
from Dion.

As soon as I have all the details, there will be a description of the
steps you need to perform in order to get a license placed on the PUPS
home page.

Cheers all,

	Warren

Another suggestion - keep a list of the licencees on the PUPS website. That
way everyone would know who they could exchange software with. Most new
stuff would probably end up on the site anyway, but during development
it might be good to know.

As most all of the "new stuff" lately seems to be 2.11BSD-related,
this brings up a (probably silly) question of mine: what's the
relationship between the SCO license agreement and 2.9, 2.10, and 2.11BSD?
Will the SCO license be functionally equivalent to a WE/AT&T source
license (other than the per-machine limitations)?  In other words,
are the 2BSD distributions "SUCCESSOR OPERATING SYSTEMS" in the language
of the agreement?

Another stupid question: few of us (perhaps I'm the only one) have
CD-ROM readers/writers attached to PDP-11's.  Will those who have to
transfer the source kit through a PC-clone or other Unix workstation
have to license the intermediary machines with SCO?  In other words,
will the intermediary machines need to be registered as "DESIGNATED
CPU"s?

2BSDs are definitely SUCCESSOR OPERATING SYSTEMS as they are derived from
the listed products (6th, 7th Edition and 32V) and are 16-bit operating
systems.

My interpretation is this:

	DESIGNATED CPU means all CPUs licensed as such for a specific
	SOURCE CODE PRODUCT.

	SCO grants to LICENSEE a personal, nontransferable and
	nonexclusive right to use, in the AUTHORIZED COUNTRY, each SOURCE
	CODE PRODUCT identified in Section 3 of this Agreement, solely
	for personal use [..] and solely on or in conjunction with
	DESIGNATED CPUs [...]. Such right to use includes the right to
	modify such SOURCE CODE PRODUCT and to prepare DERIVED BINARY PRODUCT
	based on such SOURCE CODE PRODUCT,

In my opinion, you can't USE the source code unless you have a CPU which
run the machine code which is produced by the source code. I can't prepare
a DERIVED BINARY PRODUCT if I don't have a PDP-11 or an emulator of such.

I'd better check with Dion.

This is a good idea, but I'd be happy for a licencee to opt out from the
list if they so desired.

All,
	I've just created a SMALL mailing list for those people who have
volunteered to write CD-ROMs, cut tapes etc. so we can distribute the
software covered by the up-coming SCO source license.

If you had volunteered but didn't receive any email about it today, please
mail me back as I've missed you somehow.

Still waiting on Dion re the final license document and the questions
regarding Mastercard and `intermediate' CPUs.

Cheers all,

	Warren

Right, that makes no sense at all.  I suspect we (you and I) will 
want to whip up a sort of cover letter for the license that
explains how to fill out the form and, as experience accumulates,
a FAQ, etc.

You can pick up binaries for 5th, 6th and 7th Edition UNIX for free,
as they are already covered by a SCO license. See

	http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/PUPS/Licenses/v7_bin_license.txt

If you also look at the PUPS Home Page

	http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/PUPS

you can pick up RK05 disk images for all three edition, as part of
Bob Supnik's PDP-11 emulator.

I finally got a chance to look at the picture; the board looks to me like
an MTI MSV22, which is a Q-bus board.  There's no way that it's a Unibus
board.  Are you sure you've got an 11/84 there, and not a 11/83?

	If you don't plan on staying current with parts that change then
	a binary only system might work.  I can't see myself volunteering
	to build binaries (especially kernels) for varying configurations.

	The older, 'static' or frozen (for now), distributions can be run
	binary only - but the traditional method of updating systems was
	to either distribute diffs  or replacement source modules.  

	One main reason for this, especially in the kernel (but also some
	applications level stuff), is that the address space of a PDP-11 does
	not allow the luxury of including all ways of doing something.  For
	example:  the C library has to be build for either 'hosts' file or
	resolver routines - can't do both.  So someone's running a binary
	only release but with a hosts file orientation.  THey want updated
	binaries but all my systems are resolver based - building new binaries
	would be painful and time consuming.  What happens when a system 
	include file changes and all (or many) of the binaries in the system
	are affected - who's going to volunteer to recompile the system and
	make a new CD for the folks who don't want to maintain current sources?

	In the kernel arena it's even worse - who ever builds a kernel would 
	have to request a 'config' file (do you want 'quotas' or not, do you
	want 'networking' and if so which ethernet card, do you want 1 or 2 
	MSCP controllers, and so on.  Ick.) and custom build a kernel (can't 
	include _all_ possible devices, etc because it just won't fit).  I 
	don't know about any one else but I'd rather not get into the 
	providing custom kernels and binaries.

	From V5 on (I can't speak for earlier) you were expected to have a
	source license (which thanks to SCO's help we now will have) and
	install/maintain the system from those.  Binary only setups were
	extremely uncommon (except in shops with lots of machines and they'd
	have a single 'master' source system and build and distribute from 
	that).  

	Configurability is very limited without sources and I'd have thought
	that everyone would be dancing with joy at being freed from binary
	only releases.

	As has been mentioned before there are binary only V6, V7, and V5
	images already available without requiring a source license at all.
	There's no need to pay the minimal $100 for the upcoming license if
	all that's desired is a binary only system that's preconfigured for
	a limited set of devices.  (re)configuration takes sources. 

	So I guess the question is who's volunteering to build and distribute
	the binary only kits?  Not me ;-)

All good reasons.  I suppose I could give access to an emulator over
the net if anybody wants to do it themselves.  This is not the way to
go if you have your own machine with enough storage, but it might be
if you're low on storage.

Exactly my understanding and V7 doesn't run on pdp-11/23s though it is 
runable on 11/73.

My interest if to have one of the many PDP-11 Qbus machines I have 
running a nonDEC OS such as unix.  The 11/23s would be a favored target 
as I have a few of them but, devices compatable with binary versions
are not available to me.

I'll look at the archive for the RL02 images.  IF there is anyone that can 
suggest a way to get the images on to the RL02 using RT-11 I'm interested.
I can kermit the files from the PC so that step is not a problem.

<Yup. These images were designed for emulators.

Understood, not much interest to me.  Running a PDP-11 sim with two of 
them behind me doesn't really do it for me.  Running unix on a sim under 
dos on a PC exceeds my grasp of reality. I'm the sort if I wanted unix 
on the PC I'd install *BSD for 386/486 and skip the simulation.  I think 
Bob S. and friends did some great work though.

For me that would be perfectly useless as the only PDP-11 compuler is the 
DECUS-C and ti's far to minimal to crunch that.  Chicken and egg.  Right 
now I need the chicken on my 11/73 before I can consider the sources
and then I have to configure enough storage to hold them.

<	that everyone would be dancing with joy at being freed from binary

I sorta am but for me $100 might as well be $10,000.

<

Their problem is from what I can tell is they are not runable on my 
11/73 with the hardware I have.  There is that little problem of 
transfering them (via RT-11?).

My config, call it a sanity test to see if there is an existant binary I 
can run:

11/73 1mb non-pmi ram
DLV11j
RQDX3 rx33, rx52(x2) (rx53 available)
RX02
RLV12 and one RL02
TK50

I can swap a DHV-11 for the DLV11j.
I can put in 1 more meg of non-pmi ram.
The TK50 is shared with a VAX.
RT-11 V5 running.
There are no RKxxs available.

I expect I'll never be able to network the 11s I have, nor will I have 
adaquate resources (Disk) to compile the kernel.  I will not discuss the
11/23 or the pro350 sitting next to them as it's been implied they could 
only run the oldest versions due to lack of I&D space.
