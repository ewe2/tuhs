It is like clockwork.

Whenever I say something about Texinfo *as a markup language* for use
in *writing books*, the discussion inevitably degenerates into a hate
rant against Info and RMS's (failed) attempt to replace man pages.
Totally missing the point too.

This is a trend on TUHS.  The same discussions, the same rants, often
the same misinformation, over and over and over again.

I start to wonder if I should continue to subscribe.
