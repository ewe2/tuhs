I don't have any preference on that.

Tahoe included both the proprietary code and the code which could "be 
freely redistributed". The same with Reno, which was also "within the 
usual licensing constraints" (as it still had the proprietary code).

Note that Net/2 was not a complete or ready-to-use system, so a better 
genealogy (than those two) may be like:

4.3BSD Reno
  |      \
  |       \
  |      4.3BSD NET/2
  |       /
  |      /
4.4BSD Alpha

Announced in June 1988 (see admin/postings/4BSD/INDEX) but even users 
outside of Berkeley reported bugs specifically against "Tahoe" source  
tree as early as at least May 1987 (see admin/bugs/4.3BSD-tahoe/).

That date is in McKusick's open sources chapter, but the "Yesterday, 
Today and Tomorrow" article says Spring 1988. It was announced in 
November/December 1988 (see admin/postings/4BSD/V1/73 and the 
/admin/postings/4BSD/INDEX). (930108.oppose.txt also says was 
distributed in 1988.) (Two Salus books also mention that it was 
announced at the BSD Workshop in Nov. 1988 to be available.)

As for dates for the files, they were probably still updated even after 
initially released (which you can see in other releases too).
