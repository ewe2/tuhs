I've already asked Clem but I'd love the troff source the network programming
overview (or programmer's guide, whatever it was called it was the intro to
programming with sockets).  The one that Masscomp did.  It was by far the
best version of that stuff I've ever seen.  Be fun to update that or just
post it.

Sun's intro manuals were pretty good.

There isn't any legal way to get the SunOS 4.1.3 source, is there?  Last
4.x release I worked on I believe.
