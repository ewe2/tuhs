Ian,

Thanks for the response and the pointer to the web page. Looks like I can run 2.9 on the machine - I just have to find myself some RL's 8-)

Did some digging around on QBus, and think i found enough info, that coupled with some contiuity tests should allow me to figure out exactly how the backplane is laid out.

regards
alex

My recollection is that these versions have requirements in hardware, such as the switch register, that may make them unsuitable for a Qbus machine - but the PUPS page >has a section that can answer definitively.  -- Ian
