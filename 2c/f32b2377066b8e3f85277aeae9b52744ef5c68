I picked up a Model 37 (ASR) for nothing at one point.   It was sitting in my kitchen and amusingly it was probably the only terminal that I didnâ€™t have to turn on the nl->crlf mapping in terminal driver.   It also handled all those ESC and SI/SO codes that nroff put out for default to do partial line spacing and shifting from the normal roman to the greek letter typebox.    I also liked the fact that it used the full RS-232 modem control lines.   When the modem came online and asserted DSR it then turned on the motor.   When carrier detect came up a big green PROCEED light lit up.   The paper tape unit was a huge side car unlike the little integral one in the model 33.     At 150 baud it was really more of a curiosity at the point I had it.
