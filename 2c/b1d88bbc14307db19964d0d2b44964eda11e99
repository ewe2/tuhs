We called it “half-ASCII”, escaping with codes 74B and 76B.  As far as I recall, it only worked
on some versions of some of the timesharing systems in some modes.  We never had a lower
case print chain at Lehigh, SO ALL OUR OUTPUT WAS IN UPPER CASE.

And don’t get me started on 63- vs 64- character set.

The availability of ASCII on other operating systems was a great improvement in my life.
And certain neurons still remember crap like 22B is R in display code.
