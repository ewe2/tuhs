ugh, I was wrong.. it was not lining up!  The 1ed "as" is also
using a 16-byte header.  This together with the "mount" issue is
making me think they used a different assembler for these sources.

.... so... we may have to either 1) alter the way as works, or 2)
remove those comment characters in the vector table...

I apologize for the earlier incorrect information and the flood of
emails..
