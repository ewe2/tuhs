Mergenthaler(-Linotype) Linotron 202

I used one of these beasts, a CRT based phototypesetter, in the late 1980s - 8” floppy disks, serial communication that pretended to be a paper tape reader. One of those times we really needed a Users' Group and there wasn’t one.

See also the memo, recently publicized here, ‘Experience with the Mergenthaler Linotron 202 Phototypesetter, or, How We Spent Our Summer Vacation’ https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/202/summer.scanned.pdf

I wish I had had access to the schematics at the end of the memo. That would have saved days of work!
