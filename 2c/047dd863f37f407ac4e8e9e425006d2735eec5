But it was fun while it lasted :-)  I learned a bit.

Eunice for certain.  Never seen NULL != 0, but didn't the Interdata boxes 
have the NUXI problem?

And one of the UNSW departments had this 11/34 clone, where the two disk 
packs (one removable) had a common spindle...  I think that was also the 
box where the clock had to be enabled/disabled by a front-panel switch, so 
you disabled it, booted Unix, then hopefully remembered to enable it.

Oh, and if it extends to organic-ware, the UNSW Library's 11/40 had no
password on "root", but had one on "oper"...
