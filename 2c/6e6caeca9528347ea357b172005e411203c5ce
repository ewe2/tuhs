Digging through google search results, I've found stuff suggesting that
it started as Two Guys and at some point they added a Third Guy.  My
VAX/VMS knowlege is long rotted, haven't touched it since the early 90s,
but ISTR having TGV Multinet on the VMS system I used, and "Three Guys
and a VAX" was the expn I remember reading at the time.
