Being British/Australian, I say "ee-dee" and "vee-eye", as they are
not really English words.  Similarly, I say "ee-max" etc.

In that case I would pronounce it as "myke".

You should hear Americans pronounce the Australian cities of Brisbane
and Melbourne.  Also, Wagga Wagga totally throws them (it's pronounced
simly as "Wogguh" here).

OK so far...

eff-user, so take that :-)

jee-roff.

tee-roff.  And, err, how would you pronounce "nroff"?

Likely "dee-eye-troff".
