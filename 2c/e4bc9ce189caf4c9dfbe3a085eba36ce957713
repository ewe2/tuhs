I think that your initial statement is correct. At Georgia Tech AT&T gave
us some 3B20s - vax size and larger, running System V, and I remember some
discussion that they were used inside AT&T as switches.

This, of course, is second hand information; perhaps some of the Bell Labs
alumni can verify for real.
