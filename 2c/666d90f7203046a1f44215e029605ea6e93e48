Indeed

yes ... but ... even UNIX binary folks had troff licenses and many/most at
ditroff licenses.  I know Masscomp just ate $5 per CPU and included it
because we did not want to mess with the older version.  If you were an
academic, it was free so most research academics had either the source or
at least a binary on their workstations.

This did not become an issue until the 386, but by that time Clark had
written what would be groff.

I think your observation is correct, but in practice, I don't think that
was what it was.

I think the academics went LaTex and that had more to do with it.   LaTex
was closer to Scribe for the PDP-10s and Vaxen, which had a short head lead
on all them until it went walled garden when CMU sold the rights (and even
its author - Brian Ried) could not use it at a Stanford.

So your are right, Wall Garden certainly impacted the result, but I think
it was more preference in this case.

Ditto to both.

Maybe -- I think the PC and Word was the real kiss of death, which I find
even more troubling.
