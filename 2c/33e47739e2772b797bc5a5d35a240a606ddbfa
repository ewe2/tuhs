ITS had this feature as well.

I actually implemented this for UNIX in a crude way.    I put a program as my login shell that spawned off a shell on a PTY and the program did sort of a lightweight “telnet” between the PTY and my login terminal.
I could then make the intermediary program go away (effectively logging out of the system) while leaving the shell running on the PTY.    The subsequent login, the program would notice I still had my previous session running and offer to reconnect it for me.
