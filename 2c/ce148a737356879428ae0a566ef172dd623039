Hi,

yet another reference but more in the spirit of what csh does, it only 
checks for a simple hash (#), no explaim mark (!), and is enclosed in 
UCB_SCRIPT define.

http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=2.9BSD/usr/src/sys/sys/sys1.c

2.11 BSD seems to have an enhanced version of this feature in the sense 
where the shell path may be followed by some arguments (i.e.: /bin/sh -x)

http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=2.11BSD/sys/sys/kern_exec.c
