At least on my Mac messages seem to be stored one per file.
Attachments are stored separately. Doesn't seem hard to figure out.
You can periodically rsync to a different place and experiment.

There is not much available that is decent.I too use Apple Mail
but also have a separate MH store that goes way back. MH is great
for bulk operations but not for viewing MIME infested mail or
simple things like attaching documents. What I really want is a
combined MUA.
