I'd love something like this to work, but the semantic interpretation would
need to also somehow be omitted, otherwise how do you replace

#ifdef AIX
ioct(fd, AIX_SPECIFIC_IOCTL, ...)
#endif

on a HUPX system that doesn't define AIX_SPECIFIC_IOCTL...

I remember hearing that BLISS could cope because it deferred the semantic
interpretation of the identifiers until after a round of dead code
elimination so it didn't need a pre-processor...
