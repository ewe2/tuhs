As others mentioned, recursion and real data structures make code
easier to read. They also refined the text some.

But in general, I think the principle of "ANYTHING written by Brian
Kernighan is worth reading, at least once" applies, even in this case.

FWIW, Brian has told me more than once that he wishes they'd done "Software
Tools In C" instead of in Pascal, and that the Pascal book was a failure
to read the market correctly.

Long ago, I once dreamed that I found "Software Tools In C" in a bookstore;
the cover had green lettering instead of the red and blue used in the
real books. I was sorta disappointed when I woke up... :-)

HTH,

Arnold
