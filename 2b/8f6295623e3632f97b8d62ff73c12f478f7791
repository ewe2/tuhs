FORTRAN, yes. BASIC (which dialect might we be talking about?) normally 
actually start with 0. However, BASIC is weird, in that the DIM 
statement is actually specifying the highest usable index, and not the 
size of the array.

Thus:

DIM X(10)

means you get an array with 11 elements. So, people who wanted to use 
array starting at 1 would still be happy, and if you wanted to start at 
0, that also worked. You might unintentionally have a bit of wasted 
memory, though.

True.

In a way, PASCAL makes the most sense. You still what range you want, 
and you get that. Anything works, and it's up to you.
That said, PASCAL could get a bit ugly when passing arrays as arguments 
to functions because of this.
