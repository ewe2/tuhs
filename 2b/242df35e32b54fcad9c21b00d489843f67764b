Anyone have UNIX News newsletters from 1975/1976 and ;login: from 
1977?

For details see 
https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_apr15_16_unix_news.pdf 
I don't know if is a complete transcription of the July 20, 1975 issue. 
That article suggests others will be reprinted, but I only found:

Number 4, March 19, 1976
https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_june_11_unix_news.pdf

Number 10, October 1976
https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_aug15_10_unix_news.pdf

Volume 2, Number 5, May--June 1977
https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_oct15_12_unix_news.pdf
(webpage wrongly says Number 10)

Volume 2, Number 7, August 1977
https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/login_aug77.pdf
excerpts: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_dec15_11_history_login.pdf

Do you know of others?

In an article, Salus wrote Number 2 is October 8, 1975 and Number 3 
is February 10, 1976.

Thanks

p.s. I have read many AUUGN issues over the past few years. Thanks for 
hosting those.
