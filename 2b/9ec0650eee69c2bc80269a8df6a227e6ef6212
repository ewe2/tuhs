I was in the kernel group at Sun at the time.  The pictures I posted
are of the guy that did the bring up.

In no way was SVr4 even remotely derived from the SunOS 4.0 kernel.

The only relation the two had was that both were derived from the 
original Unix sources but by this time they had diverged so much
there was very little in common.  Very little.

There was good reason for all the SunOS people being butt hurt, 
Scooter threw out a lot of very hard work that he wasn't smart
enough to value.  I get the $200M part, he didn't get the value
part.
