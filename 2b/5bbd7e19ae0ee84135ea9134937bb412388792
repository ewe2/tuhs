At Dual Systems, we never shipped AT&T USG System III to our customers, other than a few alphas/betas - it was such a disaster, we spent a year fixing show-stopper bugs in it. By the time we got System III into what we considered "shippable/supportable" shape, System V was out, so we started work on that. Our customers had to jump from v7 to System V, but they were spared System III.

System V was pretty awful too, but it was "industry standard" and we had to put up with that idiocy from AT&T USG. I daily retreated back to the much more pleasant use of BSD UNIX systems at UCB that I still had access to.
