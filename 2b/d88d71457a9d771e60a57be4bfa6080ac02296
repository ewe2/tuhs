God, I spelled "ancient" wrong last night. :)  It's hell getting old.

The license says:

<< 3. LICENSED SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS

The SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS to which SCO grants rights under this AGREEMENT are
restricted to the following UNIX Operating Systems, including SUCCESSOR
OPERATING SYSTEMs, that operate on the 16-Bit PDP-11 CPU and early versions of
the 32-Bit UNIX Operating System with specific exclusion of UNIX System V and
successor operating systems:  

16-Bit UNIX Editions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 32-bit 32V >>

It does not mention System III explicitly either by inclusion or exclusion so
it depends on interpretation.  The System III distribution includes both PDP-11
and VAX source but only PDP-11 binaries.  Do you think the term "early versions
of 32-Bit UNIX Operating System" covers something that came out four years
after 32V, is still fully 16-bit compatible, and does not take advantage of the
full 4GB address space the way that a true 32-bit system would?

The README says

<< The version of System III here ran on the PDP-11 platform, and was
supplied by Keith Bostic.

boot contains the tape bootstrap,
cpio.tape contains the standalone cpio(1) program,
and mini-root contains a dump of the root file system.

A tar archive of the whole of System III is available in sys3.tar.gz >>
