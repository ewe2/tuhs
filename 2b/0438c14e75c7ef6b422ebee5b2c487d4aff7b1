It was.  So was DOS-11, RT-11, RSTS/E, RSX-11-*, IAS, etc.

Anything but the very lowest end (11/04, 11/03, etc.) if you want
to run Unix.

While Unixes show up on -11's in many applications, they were
least popular in industrial-control type situations, which is where
most -11's are used.  Of course, just to complicate things, they
were using Unix variants on 11-based industrial control systems too!
And you are right, it is indeed possible that this particular 11/23
has some Unix packs in the deal, I'm just pointing out that it's
unlikely.

And you were especially correct that a buyer would be unwise to
ditch the drives and packs.  An -11 is more than just the CPU box,
if you want to do anything even vaguely useful/interesting!

Tim.
