Forgive me, but I think that's a bit of an odd analogy (or perhaps an
indication that I did not adequately explain what I meant).  However, let
me run with it for a moment and rephrase my statement: there can only be a
discovery if one decides it's worth doing the sort of investigation that
would lead to a new discovery, and I wonder whether "we" still have that
kind of curiosity or drive.  Or has Linux become so entrenched that no one
can imagine bothering anymore?

To whit: it appears that "we" (for some large value of "we") have
collectively decided that it's not worth looking for a replacement for
Linux.  If nothing else, I find that interesting.
