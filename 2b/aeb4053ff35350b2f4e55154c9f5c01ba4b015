This.  This is it.  You and I must be the same kind of weird because when
I wanted a scripting language that wasn't TCL weirdness, I had a compiler
built that compiled stuff that so looked like C, I had a guy fix a bug in
a patch that flew by.

My big complaint with stuff like Rust, or even Go (sorry Rob), is that they
picked a different syntax.  Why not just use C syntax and extend it to do
what you want?  Why must every project redo everything.
