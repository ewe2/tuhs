I'm tinkering with the pageout daemon so I'm trying to apply memory
pressure.  I have 10 25GB processes (25GB malloced) and the processes just
walk the memory over and over.  This is on a 256GB main memory machine
(2 socket haswell, 28 cpus, 28 1TB SSDs, on loan from Netflix).

It's the old "10 pounds of shit in a 5 pound bag" problem, same old stuff,
just a bigger bag.

The problem is that OOM can't kill the processes that are the problem,
they are stuck in disk wait.  That's why I started asking why can't you
kill a process that's in the middle of I/O.
