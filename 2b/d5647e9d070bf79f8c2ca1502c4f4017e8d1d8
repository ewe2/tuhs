Now that's an interesting question.  Being paper tape, it's from the days
in which you could see a bit with the naked eye.  Another industrial
artifact that I have somewhere is a paper tape reader, but it would take
time away from skiing to get it working.  Does anybody know if the
Computer History Museum or equivalent has a DEC paper tape reader that
works?  I could probably lay it out on a scanner but that would be
tedious.  Might actually be best, it's over 45 years old and probably
fragile.
