I think that perhaps some codewords should be adopted for various *nix
flavours/implementations/reimplementations. For example: linux =
frogboat. Nobody will ever come here to ask about fixing problem with
this.

And besides, I would really not mind if there was a single place where
I could read something about frogboat and other dolls. Reusing this
list for such purpose is ok for me, since I am already subscribed.
