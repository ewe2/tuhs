(my apologies, I sent this the other day assuming it would
  be sent to the list, but instead it got sent directly to
  rob pike! oops!)

I agree, but I do believe that the time itself is a mitigating
factor.

To me this is much more akin to replicating a key for a lock
that is no longer used, than anything else. It really doesn't
serve much more purpose than pure curiosity and is of historical
interest at best.

On a (slightly?) related note, it's very, very surprising to me
that this has hit news outlets. I never considered that this
would get much more than a handful of replies, let alone this
much interest.
