I had a stint in life where my "primary" environment was a VT320 hooked up
to a VAXstation running VMS, from which I'd telnet to a Unix machine.
Subjectively, it was among the more productive times in my life
professionally: I felt that I wrote good code and could concentrate on what
I was working on.

Fast forward 15 years (so a little 10 years ago), I'm sitting in front of a
Mac Pro desktop with two large displays and an infinite number of browser
tabs open and I feel almost hopelessly productive. I just can't
concentrate; I can't find anything; things are beeping at me all the time
and I have no idea where the music is coming from. Ads are telling me I
should buy all kinds of things I didn't even know I needed; the temptation
to read the news, or email, or the plot of some movie I saw an ad for 20
years ago (but never saw) on wikipedia is too great and another 45 minutes
are gone.

So I go on ebay and find a VT420 in good condition and buy it; it arrives
an unproductive week later, and I hook it up to the serial port on my Linux
machine at work and configure getty and login and ... wow, this is
terrible! It's just too dang and limiting. And that hum from the flyback
transformer is annoyingly distracting.

The lesson is that we look back at our old environments through the rosy
glasses of nostalgia, but we forget the pain points. Yeah, we might moan
about the X protocol or the complexity of SMP or filesystems or mmap() or
whatever, but hey, programs that I care about to get my work done are
already written for those environments, and do I _really_ want to write
another shell or terminal program or editor or email client? Actually...no.
No, I do not.

So I'm sympathetic to this.

I get it.  I love the clean simple lines that were the original Unix
> but we live in a more complex world.


But this I take some exception to. Yes, the world is more complex, but part
of the complexity of our systems is, as Jon asserts, poor abstractions.
It's like the recent discussion of ZFS vs merged VM/Buffer caches: most
people don't care. But as a system designer, I do. One _can_ build systems
that support graphics and networking without X11 and sockets and with a
small number of system calls. One _can_ provide some support for "legacy"
systems by papering over the difference with a library (back in the day,
someone even ported X11 to Plan 9), but it does get messy and you hit
limitations at some point.

I'd just like to stress I'm not trying to criticize Ted, or anyone else,
really. We've got the systems we've got. But a lot of the complexity we've
got in those systems comes from trying to retrofit a design that was
fundamentally oriented towards a uniprocessor machine onto a multiprocessor
system that looks approximately nothing like a PDP-11. I do agree with Jon
that much of Linux's complexity is unjustified (functions called `foo` that
call `__foo` that calls `__do_foo_for_bar`...I understand this is to limit
nesting. But...dang), but much of it is forced by trying to accommodate a
particular system model on systems that are no longer really amenable to
that model.

        - Dan C.

I'd argue listen to Ted.  He's got the balance.
