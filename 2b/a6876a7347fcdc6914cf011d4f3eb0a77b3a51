Yes, seems that we all gave Warren the same thing.

I've had 4.2.10 running on a box for a while now - not done a thing
with it yet re network stack.

Photos of the box in "action".

There is a TCP/IP stack floating round for Coherent (I have Tulip and
NE2000 drivers for it), but I forget where to obtain it now.  If I
locate it, I'll upload it for Warren to add.

Incidentally, there is also no virtual memory support with 4.2.10.
