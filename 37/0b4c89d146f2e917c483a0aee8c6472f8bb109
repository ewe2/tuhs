Sure, but here again you can have the shell hang on to the
(kernel allocated) pgroup, and any control operation amounts
to, e.g., "set tty pgroup to the one for my pgroupid X".
Since the shell is waiting for everything in the pipeline
to exit, the shell knows when to close its "pgid descriptor".

(If you abandon the pipeline entirely, you also abandon the
ability to attach it to a tty.  There should be some way to
"rejoin" pgroups, which would let you attach them to new tty
sessions, which is something that is missing from the current
system.  But that's another thing entirely.)
