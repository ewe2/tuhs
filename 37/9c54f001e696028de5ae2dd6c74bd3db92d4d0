No; that doesn't ring any bells with me.  It was definitely for CP/M, for 
the Australian Microbee, but I have since lost the CD and the floppies.

And the most amusing thing about the Microbee (yeah, getting OT here) was 
that serial comms was done by bit-banging on a parallel port...  9600 
half-duplex, or 2400 full-duplex.

I tried to bring up KA9Q with a view to getting SLIP working, but no.
