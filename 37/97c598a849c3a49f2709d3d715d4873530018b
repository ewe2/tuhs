I wonder if it used troff or ditroff and then what it used for the ps
engine (probably Ghostscript) and if ditroff, from where the font metric
tables came?  I also wonder what it was using for cat4 to ps conversion
again like Ghostscript.  Like most folks in those days (even most
Universities) since Transcript was reasonably inexpensive, most people
bought it after they got their first PS based printer, particularly if they
had chosen to upgrade to ditroff.    For Masscomp (one advantage of being a
$10K-$50K machine not a $4K one), I did manage to convince management to
buy ditroff and transcript and buy the distribution license for both.  It
increased our price by less than $100 but we justified it that we really
did not want to have to support the original troff and the price to AT&T
and Adobe was just cost of doing business and cheaper for us from a cost of
maintenance standpoint.   We then just bundled ditroff/transcript on every
machine.  Funny, Sun charged for both, it was fairly cheap - I want to say
$500 a node (Larry may remember).   But you had to buy it from
Sun ala-cart.   Many (most) universities did not because they already had
the sources for their Vaxen, so then tended to recompile and move it.

At Stellar we used Sun's as the 'porting base' - since we had to buy AT&T
redistributions licenses anyway, we didn't pay the Sun per node tax.
