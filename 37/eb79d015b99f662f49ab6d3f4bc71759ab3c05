Bob,

Sorry! I think I was actually talking about a different Bell title. I  
checked my past orders and found the following:

Author: Bell, C. Gordon; Newell, Allen
Title: Computer Structures: Readings and Examples

Author: Siewiorek, Daniel; Bell, C. Gordon; Newell, Allen,
Title: Computer Structures: Principles and Examples

Both of these contain many architectural case studies (each book  
covers a different set). And both should be findable in this list:

an=bell&sts=t&tn=computer+structures

I also have Computer Engineering but it's a different book! Sorry  
again about the confusion.
