Ya....  From what (little) I know about 3270 (and 5250 for AS/400s?) 
reminds me of HTML forms with the mainframe as the web server and the 
terminal as the client web browser.  What with the mainframe sending 
[protected,hidden] fields to the terminal that displayed them and 
trusted what the terminal sent back.  *headshake*  Times were different. 
  I am guessing that there is also security through obscurity based on 
what information was available at the time.

I wonder if USS / OMVS terminal ~ application on more modern mainframes 
still run into issues.
