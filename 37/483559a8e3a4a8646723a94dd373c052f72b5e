If you mean specificall the dash, I can't help much.  But there were
similar ideas elsewhere.  UNIVAC EXEC-8 (for the 1108, late 1960s) had
options that followed the command with a comma, like:

  @RUN,G GOPU,STANDARD,STANDARD
  @ADD,PL ASGDMS              . ASSIGNIERT DATENBASIS
  @ASG,A PF.                  . PF IST PROGRAMM-FILE MIT GOPU
  @XQT PF.GOPU

The letters after the comma were option letters, conveniently packed
into a machine word so that they didn't require parsing.

OMEGA on the Univac 494 had something similar, but delimited by a
space rather than a comma, reminiscent of earlier tar syntax.

I don't know any other systems, but since UNIVAC and Unix aren't
closely related, I'd guess that there were similar ideas elsewhere
too.
