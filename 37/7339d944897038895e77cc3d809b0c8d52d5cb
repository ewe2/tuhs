Early directory services were rcp/ftp, in all their glory. :). Mostly
though at the small school I was at it was moot. THE VAX we had was 100%
ASCII terminals to access it, except if you were logging in from the
Tops-20 box via telnet from one of its ASCII terminals.

SunOS 4 definitely had YP. We used it in school when the Tops-20 machine
was replaced by a boatload of 68000 machines running SunOS and Suntools...
I can't recall if 3.5 also had it or not... it was later it changed to NIS.
