Oh, definitely. I'm trying to limit myself to Latin-A at the moment. 
Otherwise the list will just be ridiculously long.

You have, of course, U+41, but you also have U+FF21. But if you want to 
go slightly silly, you also have U+1F110, U+1F130, U+1F150, U+1F170, 
U+1F1E6, U+E0041... And god know if I've missed some other ones.
Of course whitespace and other typographic details matters. That's why 
we have different code points for the letter, depending on things like 
whitespace.
