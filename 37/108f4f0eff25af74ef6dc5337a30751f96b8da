The test suite seems to be written to test for the problems of a genetic UNIX.

It does not test a lot of things that are known to be correct in e.g. Solaris.

If you like to verify other implementations (like e.g. Mac OS X), you need to 
check other places in the interfaces and the problem with "waitid()" is that 
the POSIX text has been correct when waitid() has been introduced in 1996, but
later a bug slipped in. A bug that has been fixed just a year ago (in case of
e.g. waitid()).

In order to get a fix for waitid(), we would need to wait until Apple certifies 
their OS for ISSUE 7 + TC2. This is because ISSUE 7 + TC2 has been accepted by 
IEEE in December 2016...
