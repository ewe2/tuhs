"The processor arrived at the end of the summer [1970], but the PDP-11
was so new a product that no disk was available until December. In the
meantime, a rudimentary, core-only version of Unix was written using
a cross-assembler on the PDP-7. Most of the time, the machine sat in
a corner, enumerating all the closed Knight's tours on a 6×8 chess
board—a three-month job."
