Thanks for that!

Indeed they are on the /dev/fd man page of 8th Edition.

I=E2=80=99m thrilled that https://unix50.org is back up and could =
quickly check. They are not symlinks, but character special files (with =
the same major/minor, of course). In the /dev/fd directory all 128 =
possible device entries were added.

It certainly suggests that a virtual /dev directory (like /proc) would =
have been useful.

Googling for /dev/fd also answered my other question: =
http://poincare.matf.bg.ac.rs/~ivana/courses/ps/sistemi_knjige/pomocno/apu=
e/APUE/0201433079/ch03lev1sec16.html

"The /dev/fd feature was developed by Tom Duff and appeared in the 8th =
Edition of the Research UNIX System.=E2=80=9D
