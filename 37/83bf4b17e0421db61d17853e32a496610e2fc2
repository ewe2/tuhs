Hi Larry,

> I miss Brian on this list.

I too think it would be great if he was, but I suspect if he wanted to
be here, he would already be.  He gets forwarded the odd list email by
some ex-colleagues that want his input on a bit of history and they feed
back his recollection.  By not being here he probably gets a lot more done
with his time.  :-)  Especially with the recent influx of new subscribers
and the possible growth in number of emails and change in signal:noise.

Cheers, Ralph.
