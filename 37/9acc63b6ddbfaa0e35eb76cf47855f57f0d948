A note on the PC hardware front:

Solaris 11+ has been doing very well for me on PC-based platforms for 
quite a few years now. The drivers handle everything up to probably the 
lastest-gen( minus 1) LSI or Emulex or any other disk/fiber controllers, 
10Gbe Intel or Mellanox ethernet cards, and generally support enough USB 
stuff to make it worthwhile for me - USB serial port adapters actually 
DO wind up in /dev/cua ;)

The Intel processor support has been great w/NUMA aware scheduler (check 
out lgrpinfo on a Solaris box) which is very useful for Oracle DB, and a 
few other things I can't think of right now.

I don't use it for desktop though, except for Xvnc with a bunch of 
xterms open so I don't lose my mind when my Windows workstation gets 
more perpetual updates and I have to reboot it. Xvnc also helps to deal 
with the inevitable Oracle GUI-based installations.

One thing I left out of my original post on this thread was that when I 
say "Unix" - I include Linux in that. It's not, technically, and being 
the anti-Linux snob that I am, I wouldn't include it in the term "Unix". 
However, I left that up to the individual as to whether or not they want 
to call Linux "Unix" ;)
