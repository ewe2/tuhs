Hi,

If the following  README sounds interesting to you, maybe we can
arrange to put a tar ball of it onto minnie?

I also prepared postscript files of the V6-documentation.
Anyone interested?

Wolfgang

First README:
UNIX V6 on the Supnik simulator:
--------------------------------
This directory contains tape files for the Supnik simulator and
accompaning README files, which I produced when preparing an OS
course at the Berufsakademie. Further it contains C-sources of two
commands (enblock.c/deblock.c). These commands prepare a tapefile for the
simulator (enblock) and produce a plain file from a simulator
tapefile (deblock).

The Supnik simulator can be obtained from:
	ftp://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/pub/PDP-11/Sims/Supnik_2.3/sources/
I used the sim_2.3d.tar.gz tar ball.

This directory contains a *.README and *.enb files with the following
basenames:

ctable: A bug in the input table for the C-compiler code generator is fixed.
ctime:	Some y2k related changes to V6.
dcheck: Bug fix and enhancement of dcheck. 
dist:	The V6 distribution tape: dist.README explains how to install
	and setup UNIX-V6 with the simulator. The file dist.enb is missing
	for copyright and space reasons, you have to prepare it yourself.
	(see enb.README). 
dotdot: Kernel enhancement: If in a root directoy of a mounted filesystem,
	let ".." mean the parent of the mount point, not the root directory.
enb:	Conventions and usage of .enb files. Explains how to
	prepare tape files for the Supnik simulator and tells you
	how to prepare the V6 distribution tape.
ludiv:	Derivation of a double word unsigned division algorithm, which is used
	in ctime. (no corresponding .enb)
man:	The man command, which was missing from the distribution, and some
	changes to make V6-nroff output readable on an xterm.

So enb.README and dist.README are the next files you should read.

If you have questions or find bugs or whatever, mail to
	helbig at informatik.ba-stuttgart.de

Last but not least I thankfully acknowledge the work of the people
who talked SCO into offering the ancient-UNIX source license, who collected
the old distribution tapes and run the PUPS Archive. And of course I thank
Bob Supnik for this great simulator!

Second README:
This directory contains some documentation as found on the UNIX V6
Distribution tape. The files were converted to postscript with
groff and the usage of the V6 ms-macro package. (See the print
shell script)

Assembler:				as.ps		(*)
Beginners Guide:			beg.ps		(*)
C-Language Reference:			c.ps		(***)
C-Tutorial:				ctut.ps		(**)
ED-Tutorial:				ed.ps		(*)
Summary of UNIX:			hel.ps		(*)
Description of the C-IO-Library:	iolib.ps	()
Description of the kernel IO/Subsystem:	iosys.ps	(**)
Some thought about security:		secur.ps	(*)
Instruction how to install V6 from tape:start.ps	(***)
Table of Contents of the Online Manual	toc.ps		(**)
Overview of UNIX (ACM-paper)		unix.ps		(***)
YACC - yet another compiler compiler	yacc.ps		()

The more stars the more useful for the OS course. Two or more stars
indicate high recommended!

From the V7-distribution I included "A tour through the UNIX-C-Compiler"
(ctour.ps), which describes the internal workings of the said
compiler. The format and meaning of /usr/sources/c/table.s is
particular interesting reading if you want to learn about how a
compiler generates machine code.

The shell script "print" can be used to format the *.ps files.
(on a contemporary UNIX system with groff)

The file tmac.s contains V6-ms macros, which are used by some of
the doc files.

Some of the V6 doc files needed to be adopted to groff to render
acceptable output. But the 25 year old troff sources were amazingly
compatible with groff.
