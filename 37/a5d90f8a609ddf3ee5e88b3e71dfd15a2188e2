I never used realloc(), only malloc() and calloc().

Checking a few unixes I have access to all reallocs() seem to state
either nothing on contents of memory added or state explicitly
'undefined'.

The only function which zeroes allocated memory is calloc() it seems.
Unixes checks: SCO UNIX 3.2V4.2, Digital Unix 4.0G, Tru64 Unix V5.1B,
HP-UX 11.23, HP-UX 11.31

Cheers
