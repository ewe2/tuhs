And I believe at the time, KO was commenting in terms of Bell=E2=80=99s  =E2=

 12 bit systems) of the day -DEC=E2=80=99s PDP-8 not the 10.  IIRC The 8 pre=
tty much had a base price in the $30k range in the mid to late 60s.  FWIW th=
e original 8 was discrete bipolar (matched) transistors built with DEC flip c=

Also please remember that originally, mini did not mean small.  That was a c=
