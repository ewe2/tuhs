Don't make me cry in my coffee :(

Personally, I'll either run with it for as long as I can and deal with 
it, and hope that Oracle at least releases the last ZFS so it can be 
incorporated somewhere, or go back to FreeBSD which I used to run before 
Solaris X86 was available to me as Solaris 7, and use the earlier 
version of ZFS.

Professionally, there's only Linux now - I'll use Oracle Linux for 
servers with Oracle products on them, but even then, I'm not liking the 
NUMA support.
