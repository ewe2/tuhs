That's your maximum, right?   I see $2.25.

Possibly.  It's a pity it's not confirmed to be readable.  In any
case, the rule for eBay bidding is to wait until the very last minute
(literally a minute or two before the auction closes) and to know what
your maximum bid is.  Specify it and you'll only pay enough to outbid
anybody else (if possible).

I'd be inclined to go to about $20 or so, but that's my feeling.

I'm surprised that Warren said no here.  It's possible that some of
the code might be different; it would certainly be worth comparing.
