For V7 tapes, you can run the V7 binaries using apout with very little
effort.
This is a user-level emulation of a pdp-11 with the system calls for v5,
v6, v7 and
some of the BSDs. It's in the tuhs archives under
Distributions/Research/Dennis_v1/unix72/tools/apout.
I used it to extract files from V7 automatically that I used in the 2.11
back-patching-to-the-original-tapes
script I wrote.

Very cool. I suspect if you want one tool for them all, you'll need to take
restore
and teach it to cope with multiple endians and word sizes... It's likely
not a huge
effort, but the restor code from V7 makes use of a lot of type-punning...
