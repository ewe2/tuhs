Personally I've yet to think of a single use for Caps Lock and Num Lock.

Whenever I get stuck with a M$ keyboard (which seems to be most of them) I 
prise off a few irritating keys so that I don't hit the poxy things by 
mistake.

Best keyboard I ever used was the PC-101, with the runner-up being the one 
with the function keys down the LHS.  Can't remember the Sun keyboards, 
but they did have some pretty ghastly ones, such as the first one; it was 
so heavy that you could've used it as a lethal weapon.
