(if this is better suited for COFF, that'd be fine too)

I've been trying to set up UUCP on my V7 system and its raspberry Pi host.
This plus the "s" editor (already working) are really all that's needed to
make this something pretty close to a daily driver, if all I wanted to do
was write text files (which in some sense is all my job _is_, but to be
fair I get a much more immediate feedback loop in my current environment).

I was following
https://github.com/jwbrase/pdp11-tools/blob/master/howtos/V7%20UUCP%20Installation%20Guide.pdf
more or less--I had already rebuilt v7 with the DZ terminal driver and was
using it for interactive sessions (albeit, before I started trying to get
UUCP running, with 7-bit line discipline--but I've since changed that).

I have 16 DZ lines, I've set them to 8-bit mode.  They're working fine,
because I can use them for terminal sessions.

I've built UUCP, set a node name, and set it up on the pi.

I can execute uucico to send files, and it, frustratingly, almost works.

From the Pi side, I see (with uulog):

uucico v7 - (2020-07-03 08:11:34.97 23106) Calling system v7 (port TCP)
uucico v7 - (2020-07-03 08:11:42.25 23106) Login successful
uucico v7 - (2020-07-03 08:11:44.44 23106) Handshake successful (protocol
'g' sending packet/window 64/3 receiving 64/7)
uucico v7 adam (2020-07-03 08:11:51.61 23106) Sending

uucico v7 adam (2020-07-03 08:16:21.79 23106) ERROR: Timed out waiting for

uucico v7 - (2020-07-03 08:16:21.80 23106) Protocol 'g' packets: sent 86,

uucico v7 - (2020-07-03 08:16:22.51 23106) Call complete (283 seconds 5440
bytes 19 bps)

So it's clearly logging in, and if I telnet in directly, the v7 end is
starting uucico as expected:

login: pi-uucp
Password:
Shere

uulog -x on the v7 side has no output, and nothing ever appears in the
spool directory, which I suspect is a direct result of the timeout waiting
for packet.

So my question is, what else do I do to debug this?  Clearly the pi (Taylor
UUCP) side is expecting something else--maybe an acknowledgement?--from the
v7 side to let it know the transmission was successful.

Any help would be appreciated.

Adam
