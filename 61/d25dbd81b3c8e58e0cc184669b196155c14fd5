Hi all, would anybody have a copy of this paper:

Multiprocessor UNIX operating systems.
Bach, M.J., and Buroff. S.J.
Bell Systems. Tech. J. 63. 8 (Oct. 1984) 1733-1749.

If so, would you be able to scan it in and e-mail it to me, or even
photocopy it and post it to me? I'll reimburse you for time & postage.

Thanks in advance,
	Warren
