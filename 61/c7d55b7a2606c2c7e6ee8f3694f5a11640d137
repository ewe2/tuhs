Does anybody have a PDF of the 1974 Unix CACM paper, I seem to have
misplaced my copy.

The 6th Edition update to the CACM paper says:

	Our PDP-11 has a 1M byte fixed-head disk, used for file system
	storage and swapping, four moving-head disk drives which each
	provide 2.5M bytes on removable disk cartridges, and a single
	moving-head disk drive which uses removable 40M byte disk packs.

The 7th Edition update says:

	Our own PDP-11 has two 200-Mb moving-head disks for file system
	storage and swapping.

Thanks,
	Warren
