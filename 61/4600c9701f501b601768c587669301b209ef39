What a great story.  There is today a website (heavens-above.com) that
does the same thing as Joe's azel.  Amateur Astronomers visit it
regularly to get the night's predictions for visible satellite
transits, visible passes of the International Space Station, etc.  I
had no idea the idea went back that far.
