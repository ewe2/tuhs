> Has anyone experimented with building Unix using C++, to take
advantage of strong typing?  My guess is no--it would be a Herculean
task likely to introduce more bugs than it would fix.

How Unix didn't get written in C++:

When Bjarne Stroustrup joined Bell Labs, he hoped to write an
operating system, but he wanted to do it in an object oriented
language, so he took a small detour to make an object-oriented
sibling of C. That turned out to be a maelstrom from which he
never escaped.
