And this also misses the point, I think.  Defining a core as 'wimpy' or not i=
s dependent on when you make the definition: the Cray-1 was not wimpy when i=
t was built, but it is now.  The interesting question is what happens to the=
 performance of serial code on a core over time.  For a long time it has inc=
reased, famously, approximately exponentially.  There is good evidence that t=
his is no longer the case and that per-core performance will fall off (or ha=
s fallen off in fact) that curve and may even become asymptotically constant=
.  If that's true, then in due course *all cores will become 'wimpy'*, and t=
o exploit the performance available from systems we will *have* to deal with=
 parallelism.

(Note I've said 'core' not 'CPU' for clarity even when it's anachronistic: I=
 never know what the right terminology is now.)=
