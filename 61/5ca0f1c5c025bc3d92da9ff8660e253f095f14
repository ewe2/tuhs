Those are both pretty funny!


BTW, Epsilon (that 250KB Emacs that I was raving about) not only runs under
Windows, it also runs under Linux, Mac OS, FreeBSD, etc. Here:

I can't say enough good things about it (hence my 30-year addiction to it).
If you want an Emacs clone that is very small; very fast; and wildly
extensible and modifiable (it comes with almost all the source), in C
(effectively); this is the one.
