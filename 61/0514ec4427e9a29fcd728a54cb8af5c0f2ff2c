1961 is about the time I was learning to type (in Britain), and I was 
taught it as "slash".  My mother - who was an excellent professional 
typist but never had any contact with computers - almost always referred 
to '/' as "slash".  The one exception I can recall is in the usage "... 
and/or ..." where it was sometimes spoken as "... and or or ..." 
(though often the first "or" was simply omitted).
