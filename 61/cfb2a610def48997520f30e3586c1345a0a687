I've only tried it in virtual machines. It feels slower and more 
sluggish than OpenIndiana (which is based on Illumos, which is the 
post-Oracle open solaris) -but I don't use OI a whole lot either.

Since there's an opening I'm curious about something mentioned earlier 
in the thread, so I'll ask.

It was said earlier that SunOS included a compiler, but it was dropped 
in Solaris. Was it possible for people to carry over the old SunOS 
compiler and use it on Solaris? Did people do that, or did they just 
have their companies spring for the actual Solaris compiler?

            It was stupid.  Having a free compiler meant that more

            software.  Most <br>
            &gt; end-users couldn't even pay their vendors for ditroff
            -- their vendors <br>
            &gt; didn't want to have to license it from AT&amp;T, even
            when they had <br>

            System V Release 4 <br>
            &gt; became more widely available that systems based on it
            were more likely <br>
            &gt; to have ditroff, and sometimes (though much more
            rarely) the "new" dpost <br>

            started on how hard it <br>
            &gt; also was to get some end users to buy a C compiler too.
            <br>
            <br>
            Yep, lived through this as well.  I fought with Sun to make
            more stuff <br>
            free for developers, it just didn't make sense to not do
            that but the <br>
            powers that were didn't get it. <br>
            <br>
            One thing that Sun did do, probably in spite of itself, was
            fund <br>
            Michael Tiemann's work on C++.  He worked out some deal that
            that <br>
            work would be open source and he pretty much made GNU C++
            work <br>
            for some definition of work (C++ is a mess). <br>
