Writing a new OS in the 70s or even early 80s meant that you had to =
replace or port a compiler toolchain, an editor, an email client, a news =
reader, an IRC client, a couple of simple games, and whatever =
applications your university/research lab needed to justify its grant =
money.  It was a chunk of work, but it was surmountable by a small team =
or even a dedicated individual.  It was demonstrably possible to build =
your own machine from CPU upward within a reasonable timeframe (eg. =
Wirth=E2=80=99s Oberon).

It=E2=80=99s still possible (and perhaps even easier) to do that today, =
but no-one=E2=80=99s really happy with an OS that only provides a =
handful of applications.  In particular, as has been widely stated, a =
modern web browser is orders of magnitude more work than an OS.  But =
expectations for every type of application have moved on, and a modern =
editor, chat/messaging app, or game is also likely orders of magnitude =
more complex and feature-rich than what was once acceptable.

For a while, it was possible to have a =E2=80=9CPOSIX emulation=E2=80=9D =
module/layer/whatever (was Mach the first to go this route?) as a =
shortcut to this but the breadth of the APIs needed to run, eg. =
Chrome/ium is again orders of magnitude more work than what was needed =
to port vi/emacs/rn/etc.

And it=E2=80=99s not just those applications: to have your new OS be =
useful, you need to support a dozen languages, a hundred protocols, =
thousands of libraries =E2=80=A6 a vast range of stuff that would take =
years, perhaps decades, to port over or reinvent in your new paradigm.

The idea that you=E2=80=99d turn your back on the accumulated value of =
50 years of countless people=E2=80=99s work because your set of system =
calls is slightly better than the one you=E2=80=99ve got now =E2=80=A6 =
that=E2=80=99s a very, very big call.

So I think the notion that =E2=80=9Cthe kids=E2=80=9D are less willing =
to understand, or to drill deep, is doing them a disservice.  They do =
understand, and they (mostly) make the choice to leverage that body of =
work rather than embark on the futility of starting afresh.
