And perhaps a bit more importantly, does he still have the raw data that drove creating the maps?  It would be very interesting to see and compare those byte counts against today's internet. (I'm also very curious to see the relative flow between the hubs, and how data fanned out from them.)

I remember when the newsgroup traffic on Usenet hit 5 MB/day.  I think that was the third "death of the net" predicted event.  Then someone stepped up and explained (in a newsgroup) how to work your way through the entire mess, using very optimized applications of rn and kill files :-)  Where is Henry Spencer these days, anyway?!
