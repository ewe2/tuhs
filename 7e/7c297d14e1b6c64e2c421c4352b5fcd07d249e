Call me a cynical old bastard (which I am), but I can't see M$ raising a 
flag for Unix...  Wasn't it Billy Gates who reportedly said that any PC 
running Linux is one not running Windoze, and did his best to discredit 
it?

I still have horrible memories of porting Unify (an early RDBMS) to Xenix, 
and getting tangled up in the poxy small/large memory models on the 
equally-poxy 286 (no, not the 386).
