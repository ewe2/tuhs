With no offense intended, I can't help noting the irony of the
following paragraph appearing in a message in the company of
others that address Unix "bloat".

>'\cX'    A mechanism that allows usage of the non-printable

Except for the ISO citations, this paragraph says the same
thing more succinctly.

'\cX'    represents a nonprintable character Y in terms of the
          printable character X whose binary code is obtained
          by adding 0x40 (decimal 64) to that for Y. (In some
          historical contexts, '^' plays the role of '\c'.)
          Alternative standard representations for certain
          nonprinting characters, e.g. '\a', '\n', '\t' above,
          are preferred by S-nail. '\c@' (NUL) serves as a
          string terminator regardless of following characters.

And this version, 1/3 the length of the original, tells all
one really needs to know.

'\cX'    represents a nonprintable character Y in terms of the
          printable character X whose binary code is obtained
          by adding 0x40 (decimal 64) to that for Y. '\c@'
          (NUL) serves as a string terminator regardless of
          following characters.
