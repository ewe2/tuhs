Oh brother. I use FreeBSD all the time. I prefer it for its stability and ZFS=
 which has NEVER let me down and I=E2=80=99ve done my share of stupid user e=
rror. Now that Linux has ZFS, it doesn=E2=80=99t seem as stuck in the dark a=
ges, but uptime on my fbsd instance is 10x any of my Linux instances. We are=
 soooo off topic, I think :). But, I=E2=80=99m always up for talking up FBSD=
. I use it in my classes, too and the system is much more coherent for my sy=
stems programming classes than linux.
