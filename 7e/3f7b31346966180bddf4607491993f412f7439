daytona was always a separate commercial product.
it was an extremely large, very efficient database.
you should think of it as analogous to a large postgres system.
rick greer was the primary author; an overview paper is
http://www09.sigmod.org/sigmod/sigmod99/eproceedings/papers/greer.pdf

for many years, probably now as well, it was the main way that
at&t stored per-call information. as of the mid 2000s, it had over 2 trillion
calls in it.
