Heidi Heiden...now there's a name I've not heard in many a year, Noel.

I don't know if it got shut off right at midnight on Jan 1, but it certainly
was pretty close to that time.    Oddly enough as time went on we started to
get link 0 messages again.     We didn't have anything set up to process
them, but we did print a message when it happened.
