Talk about brain-damaged software...  BDS C is irretrievably broken, with 
all sorts of things missing.  I used to use Hi-Tech C for CP/M, but I 
don't know whether they're still in business.  It was a full ANSI C 
compiler, with function prototypes, initialisation assignments, static 
variables, etc.

As Henry Spencer once said, to be called a C compiler it ought to at least 
be able to compile C...

(And as I've said on many occasions, the true test of a compiler is 
whether it can compile itself.)
