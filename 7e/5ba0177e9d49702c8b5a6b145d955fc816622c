Wait, so it was easier to write an emulator for a PDP-10 binary than it
would have been to port BLISS to the PDP-11?  Given the different word
sizes I would not have expected that.

I'll definitely look at those early USENIX tapes - I have copies of them
and I did think of them when I was writing this, but (at least the early
ones I looked at) don't appear to have a good index of any sort.  Did they
have a cover sheet or something equivalent that they came with?  I'm having
trouble imagining dealing with that much unindexed data on an early system.

Fascinating.  Thank you as always for the insight.
