​Interesting characterization....   It had all of the primary BSDism in
there.  As I said it was intended for the Education market., and it would
have been lost without it.   I never saw anything from a BSD that did not
pretty much just recompile on AIX/386 - but I admit I never pushed it very
hard, since it was not a primary system for me.

​It's too bad you missed one of the coolest tricks that TCF would allow you
to do​.   If you had a running TCF node (370 or 386) with a full install on
it, all you needed to install another node was the boot floppy.    The OS
would load into memory from the boot floppy, send out a couple of packets
on the network (never touching its disk) and the node would join the
cluster and immediately be a part of the system.  If the was disk was
empty, it would start to be populated in the background using replication,
if it had data, then the rebuild protocol started -- al behind the scene.
It meant a node boot was really the time to perform the cluster management
join protocol, which on TCF was fairly fast because it was bounded to 32
nodes.   Later TNC clusters the CMS was a lot more complicated.

All very, very cool.  I do miss some of those ideas.
