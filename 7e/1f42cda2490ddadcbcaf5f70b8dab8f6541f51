Hey,

You may have seen it already, but I haven't seen an announcement on the
PUPS list -

SCO has got Unix 5th, 6th and 7th Editions, Mini Unix, System III and 32V
available on their site for download. You can access them by going to
www.sco.com/offers/ancient.html and accepting the license.

Congratulations PUPS, this is a milestone.

Efton
