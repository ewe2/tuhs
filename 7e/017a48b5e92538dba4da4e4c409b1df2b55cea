WinMainCRTStartup isn't the replacement for main.   It's the replacement for begin or location zero back in the old days.  (Anybody remember seeing p&P6 printed by errant programs?).   There are different versions of that CRT startup (actually all compiled from the same module with ifdefs) that start:

main - for non-MFC console apps
wmain - same thing but with wchar_t arguments (SOMETHING C/C++ standards hasn't ever addressed to my satisfaction).
WinMain - MFC main function
wWinMain - Ditto, with wchar_t

Actually the bulk of the CRT involves converting between the command line argument as a string and argc/argv (something UNIX does by the OS), and some gook necessary to support C++.

The  fake UNIX environment (POSIX) (read/write/seek, etc...) actually is NOT initialized here, but when it is actually referenced.
