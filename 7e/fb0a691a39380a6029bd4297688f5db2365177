I finally realized that the MUA i maintain never supported these
kind of (output character set) iconv(3) errors for the main body
of the message, even after iconv tweakings (including
a n_ICONV_IGN_NOREVERSE flag).
Thus i could fix that with credit due to Doug McIlroy and you,
and will release v14.9.5 tomorrow.
Yes, so thank you both!
