Looking at the ashell sources on the 1BSD tuhs utree viewer suggests that ~
wasn't there yet, but that it was planned:

sh.c:
...

	Features remaining to be fixed up and/or implemented
	======== ========= == == ===== == === == ===========

...

 * Changes to glob to allow ~, prevent too long path, and prevent
 * perhaps running out of directories.

...

Looking at glob.c, there's no ~ nor 126/176/7e in the sources. Editing
the cont.a archive directly confirms no ~ or similar constant is
present.

By 2BSD, it was in sh.glob.c in the 'expand' function. Later versions
define TILDE as '~' and used that. V7 had no ~ in the shell, but as
you point out uucp there supported ~ for user home directories. V6
didn't have any of this included that I can find.
