Subject: [TUHS] Anybody with V7M experience?
Message-ID: <20170407092138.GA1909@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, I'm trying to build a split I/D kernel for V7M. I've installed
the system following my notes at
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/DEC/Jean_Huens_v7m/simh_notes.txt

Reading the setup.txt document in the same place, I should be able to do:

cd /sys/conf
make all44		(build the kern & dev components split I/D)
mkconf < hptmconf	(set up for hp and tm devices)
make unix44		(link the kernel)
cp unix_id /nunix	(copy it to the root)

However, when I try to boot the kernel:

PDP-11 simulator V4.0-0 Beta        git commit id: 24f1c06d

#nunix
Trap stack push abort, PC: 071752 (BIS #1,(R3))

Thanks in advance for any help.
	Warren
