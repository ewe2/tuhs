I found the same document online at

Incidentally, does anyone know anything about the 1961 DoD 8-bit
character set standard it refers to?

This does not appear to say anything about LF vs "Newline" (as either a
name or a function), though the 1986 version of ASCII deprecates it, so
was most likely acknowledged in versions between these in response to
practices on OSes such as Multics. ECMA-6:1973 acknowledges it, for
example (the fourth edition at
https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-006-arch.htm).
