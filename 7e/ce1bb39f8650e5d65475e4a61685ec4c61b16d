Subject: [TUHS] Usenix this year, anyone?

All, looks like I will be attending the Usenix technical conference in
San Diego in June this year, to present a paper on restoring some of the
early Unix artifacts. If anybody else is attending the conference, or is
in town, I would very much like to catch up.

P.S Unix turns 40 in mid-2009 as well. Happy birthday Unix!

Cheers,
	Warren
