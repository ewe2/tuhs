There is an archive on ftp://www.opensourcedepot.com/pub/32V, but it 
doesn't contain the latest code I'm working on.

The reason is that I'm working on locore.S, and the drivers, using a 
small kernel I developed some time ago as part of the 32 bit 
FreeDOS/DOS-C effort.   That kernel is easily adapted to any 
"personality" and is easy to test with.  In my version of the 32 bit 
FreeDOS effort, this kernel was akin to the "bios" in real mode, but I 
digress.

Eventually, files that contain VAX specific code, i.e., mfpr(), mtpr(), 
etc., will be modified and the bulk of the code will be processor 
independent, with processor specific code contained in separate 
directories.  The key files from this test kernel, including drivers, 
will then be rolled back into the 32V source, creating the first 32I 
kernel.  That will probably happen by the end of the month and will be 
my next code drop.  I'll announce that here when its ready.
