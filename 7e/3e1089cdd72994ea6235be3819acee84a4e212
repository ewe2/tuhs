This is a good idea, but... Here's my results from just running awk for 
\t, \n, and \b:

$ awk 'BEGIN { print "a\tb" ; exit }';
a       b
$ awk 'BEGIN { print "a\nb" ; exit }'
anb
$ awk 'BEGIN { print "a\bb" ; exit }'
abb
$

Strange. It looks like it's just ignoring the backslash in the case of 
\n and \b.
