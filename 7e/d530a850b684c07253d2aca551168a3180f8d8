7 page sizes. AL39, page 40:

 PTWAM.ADDR
The 18 high-order bits of the 24-bit absolute main memory address of
the page. The hardware ignores low-order bits of this page address
according to page size based on the following:

Page size in words    ADDR bits ignored
    64             none
   128              17
   256            16-17
   512            15-17
  1024            14-17
  2048            13-17
  4096            12-17


I am unsure of exactly which model supported this, but somewhere in the
evolution from 645 to DPS8-M.
