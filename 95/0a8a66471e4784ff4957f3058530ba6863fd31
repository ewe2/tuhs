Warren,

    Have you followed Groklaw?  Years ago, we put together a simple 
database to capture information on UNIX, books, technical papers, etc., 
for Groklaw.  It is still running to this day:

http://groklib.anteil.com/books/basic_list

It has a permanent spot on Groklaw's left hand menu ... 
http://www.groklaw.net

We have physical and virtual servers located in a colo-center with dual 
10-meg fiber to 8 N. Broad St. in Philadelphia.  The site has battery 
and generator backup.

Cheers,

Jim
