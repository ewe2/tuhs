As I understood it, there were no bootable 4.4 BSD lite releases from 
Berkley.  The 'lite' releases had the AT&T encumbered stuff removed and 
not replaced, it wasn't a complete and functional OS.

If you want something bootable, your closest bet is probably the 1.0 
releases of Free[1] or NetBSD[2].
