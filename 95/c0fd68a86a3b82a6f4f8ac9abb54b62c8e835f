ftp.mayn.de used to serve the stuff, but it they switched servers,
and it looks as if their archives are still high&dry. Planetmirror
pleads amnesia.I grabbed a copy of mayn's coherent tree last April,
some 2GB tgz'd.  This is the complete Coherent installation, in form
of a copy of .dd floppy images, and some additional pieces.
Unfortunately I don't have any FTP server set up anywhere, so do you,
by chance, have a place where I can drop it off?

BTW.. should anyboy's response get nuked by my smtpd, please respond
to usenet54 at keck.us.
