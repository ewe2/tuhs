This came up on this list back in 2017 and I posted something about this at
the time:

https://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2017-January/009325.html

If the language had been extended to support a "compile-type conditional"
syntax ("if #(LINUX)", for example) it would have obviated the need for
most preprocessor conditionals. As long as, syntactically, the compiler
could tokenize a block in absence of e.g. type definitions, dead-code
elimination could do the job.
