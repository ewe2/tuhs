It appears to be a transcription of an interview (yes probably subsequently imprecisely OCR’d).   It doesn’t sound like it’s actually the quality of a published article (since it still has inline comments about skipping things as requested), but likely is some piece of correspondence between Bill and whoever.

Given some of the events he is talking about in current situation it seems to date to the mid 90’s.   It is after Mosaic (1982) but refers to Jon as if he is still alive (he died in 1998).   It’s also incredibly off the cuff.   Bill is off by a couple of years on the dates (ARPANET/TCP conversion, VAX 11/750 availability).



I thing E-bid? ASCH is 8-bit ASCII.   EBCDIC doesn’t make any sense in that context.
