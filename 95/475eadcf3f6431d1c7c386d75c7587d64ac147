For a simple example, see http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/4/ftpfs .

This uses the usual filesystem interface to the network stack to manage the underlying TCP connections.  The FTP protocol is implemented inside the ftpfs fileserver process which itself exports a directory into the filesystem namespace.  Fileservers are the natural representation of RPC protocols in plan9, and they work quite well.

Of course, not everything will naturally map to a filesystem namespace.  But a surprisingly large number of things will, given some thought to the problem.

http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/names.pdf is a must-read to appreciate the nuances of how this works.

P.S.  A fun example of the simplicity of the plan9 network API is this implementation of rlogin: http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sources/contrib/rsc/rlogin
