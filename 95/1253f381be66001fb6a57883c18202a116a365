Larry McVoy scripsit:

> GNU has an SCCS clone.  A so-so one but James and his crew fixes bugs.

OpenIndiana has a derivative of the SVR4 version, and so does the
Heirloom Toolkit.

Consider the matter of Analytic Philosophy.  Dennett and Bennett are well-known.
Dennett rarely or never cites Bennett, so Bennett rarely or never cites Dennett.
There is also one Dummett.  By their works shall ye know them.  However, just as
no trinities have fourth persons (Zeppo Marx notwithstanding), Bummett is hardly
known by his works.  Indeed, Bummett does not exist.  It is part of the function
of this and other e-mail messages, therefore, to do what they can to create him.
