Current loop to EIA RS-232 (which is the relevant standard) converters
are readily available, saith Google.  There are also RS-232 to USB
converters for the other end.

I dialed up The World's local dialup line for my area, and heard a large
variety of tones including Bell 103-compatible FSK, which is 300 baud.
I suspect that anything that can do Bell 103 can fall back to Bell 101,
which was 110 baud.  I admit to never trying it.

Note that it's 110 baud because there are a start bit and two stop bits,
so it's really 10 cps.  300 baud has only one of each, hence 30 cps.

The LA36, the only one I ever used personally, was 30 cps, ergo 300 baud.
(Note that it buffered and could print faster to catch up after a long
carriage return.) There was also an LA120 at 120cps.
