Editing that way seem is bass ackwards -- probably more code
would needed to interface with readline than just implementing
it in ed. As a one line version requires just line movement
commands, there is no reason why you can't use full power of
vi through a narrow window - such as d} to delete to the end
of para and have the next line dispayed. Readline wouldn't
help there. And readline weighs in @ 28K LOC to ed's 3.5K (on
plan9 it is under 1.6K).

Ditto!
