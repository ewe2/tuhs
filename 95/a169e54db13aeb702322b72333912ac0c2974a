At times I=E2=80=99ve been pondering this as well. All of =
creat/open/pipe could have been rolled into just open(). It is not clear =
to me why this synthesis did not happen around the time of 7th edition; =
although it seems the creat/open merger happened in BSD around that =
time.

As to pipe(), the very first implementation returned just a single fd =
where writes echoed to reads. It was backed by a single disk buffer, so =
could only hold ~500 bytes, which was probably not enough in practice. =
Then it was reimplemented using an anonymous file as backing store and =
got the modern two fd system call. The latter probably arose as a =
convenient hack to store the two file pointers needed.

It would have been possible to implement the anonymous file solution =
still using a single fd, and storing the second file pointer in the =
inode. Maybe this felt as a worse hack at the time (the conceptual split =
in vnode / inode was still a decade into the future.)

With a single fd, it would also have been possible to have a cloning =
device for pipe=E2=80=99s as you suggest (e.g. /dev/pipe, somewhat =
analogous to the implementation of /dev/stdin in 10th edition). =
Arguably, in total code/data size this would not have been much =
different from pipe().

My guess is that from a 1975 perspective, creat/open/pipe was not =
perceived as something that needed fixing.
