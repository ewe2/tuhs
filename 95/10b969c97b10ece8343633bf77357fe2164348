Dear all,

Apologies for this semi-spam message from a long-time appreciator of =
classic computers and nostalgic obsolete products, but I hope this will =
be of interest to at least a few people here.

So, yes, by way of context, I've been acquiring what I consider to be =
characterful and/or historically interesting computers for coming up to, =
maybe, 15 years now, with the intention of being able to curate =
multiple, interactive temporary exhibits on the history of computing, =
but since moving continents (amongst other things), my paths and =
passions have changed, so I am currently in the process of re-testing =
(and repairing) my machines, and will be trying to sell them off in the =
coming weeks and months. Under different circumstances, finding people =
(or groups) with similar interests and plans would have been an =
equal-first priority, but given my more recent 'life changes', sale =
price =E2=80=94 and the ability to better pursue my new focuses =E2=80=94 =
is now more of a factor.

(That said, if you are (or know) a developer of an open source machine =
emulator who could use one of these machines --- particularly one of the =
more obscure ones --- please do get in touch, as the prospect of people =
being able to keep older / rarer operating systems and software running =
once the physical machines are not longer available or working /is/ =
actually still kinda important to me, and I'd be open to a lower price =
and/or setting up some remote access with some kind of kludged-together =
iLO and vaguely 'dual-ported' disk access via, e.g., an SD2SCSI setup.)

But before I list them on eBay (and/or by way of a heads up), I wanted =
to let people here know, just in case I have something that someone here =
particularly wants / needs / could use. The current list of systems I =
will be parting with is accessible at =
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QqUrO11gnn4fwAPDxqO_phKDt1M0O15G7w=
JxHoQrL9s but some (hopefully) highlights include (*big breath*):


DEC: MicroPDP-11/53+; MicroVAX 2000; VAXstation 4000 VLC/60/90A/96; VAX =
4000 100A, 105; DECstation 5000/240, 260 (MIPS-based); DEC 3000/300X; =
Personal Workstation 600au; AlphaServer 4100; AlphaServer DS20, DS25 =
systems; Letterwriter 100; VT 101, 220, 520 terminals
HP: HP rx2800 Integrity2; 9000 715/100 and Visualize C110 PA-RISC =
systems
SGI: Indy and O2 systems
SUN: ELC, SPARCstation Voyager (the portable one), 5 and 20; Ultra 1; =
Ultra 5; Netra T1-105; Enterprise T5240
Apple: IIc, IIe Platinums, IIgs; Mac 512ke, Mac Pluses; SE/30 and Quadra =
700s (also for running A/UX); iMac G3s and a G4
Commodore: PET 3000 systems, PET 8032-SK; various C64 / C64C and 128D =
systems; SX-64; Music Maker keyboards (the big one, inc. SFX modules); =
Amiga 1000


Apologies again, please feel free to contact me with any queries or =
reasonable offers, or even if you'd just like to be kept in the loop as =
more machines become available, and all the best.

Thanks in advance,

Peter


P.S. In light of the responses I've received to posts I've made =
elsewhere, I've included a 'Default Reserve' price in the aforementioned =
spreadsheet. I've written more about this there, but the gist of it is =
that, given that very few of the more obscure / awesome machines have =
gone through eBay recently, it's kinda hard for me to gauge what a fair =
and reasonable (to me and the future buyers) price is for quite a few of =
my machines --- I've started to put in rough figures for /some/ of them =
based upon 'what feels right', but if there's nothing there, please =
don't ask me what I might want for them as I don't know yet (though do =
feel free to make me an offer). Thanks again!=
