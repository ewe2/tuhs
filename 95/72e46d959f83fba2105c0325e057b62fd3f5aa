The RK8E bootstrap for OS/8 was even shorter: just two instructions.
The first loaded a block from the disk (you forced it to be block 0 loaded
at address 0 of field 0 by using the CLEAR key on the front panel first),
and the second was jump-to-self, which executed until the disk overwrote
it with code that waited until the block had been loaded and then continued
executing the newly loaded code.
