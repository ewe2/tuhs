Here are scans of non-unix roff in 1971: https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/roff71/roff71
I also have 1969, but it's bedtime and that will have to wait.

Relative numbers (+n), roman numerals, .ti, top and bottom margin settings,
.po, running titles, tab settings, hyphenation and footnotes were not in
Saltzer's runoff. Most other features were.
