When I look at "readme.txt" on my RT11 disk from Tim Shoppa I find the
following paragraph:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The second part of the disk is seven RT-11 partitions.  Each is a 65536
block RT-11 device that is accessible on a PDP-11 machine with a SCSI
host adapter and a SCSI CD-ROM drive.  They appear as RT-11
DU partitions 13 through 19.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

The implication to me is that any of these partitions could be copied
to a 32MB file on a hard drive, and then attached to the PDP11 simulator
of your choice and read as an RT-11 drive.

The tool I would use for copying the partition is dd(1).

	dd if=/mnt/cdrom bs=32M skip=13 count=1 of=dskimg

This requires that you have 32MB available RAM for the dd "copy in"
and 32MB available disk space for the dd "copy out".  You could
trade off a smaller "bs" for a more complicated calculation of the "skip".
I suppose I am making the assumption that this work is being done on
a Unix-like system, which seems reasonable in the PUPS context.
