Subject: [TUHS] Harvard and Von Neumann Architectures and Unix
Message-ID: <6b6fd55e-d1f9-5ee2-42ac-309d6b2923b3@gmail.com>

I am curious about how the Harvard Architecture relates to Unix, 
historically. If the Harvard Architecture is predicated on the 
separation of code from data in order to prevent self-modifying code (my 
interpretation), then it would seem to me to be somewhat at odds with a 
Unix philosophy of extreme abstraction (code, data, it's all 0's and 
1's, after all). In my naive understanding, the PDP-11 itself, with the 
Unibus and apparently agnostic ISA seem to summarily reject the Harvard 
Architecure...

My question is - was there tension around Harvard and Von Neumann 
architectures in Unix circles and if so, how was it resolved?

Thanks,

Will
