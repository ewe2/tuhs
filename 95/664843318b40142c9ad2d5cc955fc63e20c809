This is the same story Peer-to-Peer gave me about two months ago
when I enquired after a copy of Lions' Commentary. I hope they
are able to arrange the reprint. FWIW, they offered to take a
pre-order, which offer I declined because they were disappointingly
vague about when the order would be filled. :-(
