Yep already fallen into that trap. Glad I'm running on a sim! Yes I'd
considered writing a small program to reset the STTY settings, and you've
helped me to understand how I can run it!

In answer to the CR question, is it that in raw mode, the CR does not get
mapped to LF, and therefore the shell doesn't see the LF character and
recognize the end of the line? Incidentally, why the ^J before ft? Just to
clean up the shell input status?

I'll write my own ft, thanks. I'll try raw mode, because I want some better
line editing capability.

Alternatively if I toy around with /dev/tty does that interfere with the
operation of the standard console outside of my app?
