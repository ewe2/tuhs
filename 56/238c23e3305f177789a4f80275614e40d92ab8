New installs of Debian will use a /usr merged configuration.  However,
for pre-existing installations, we are not yet forcing, or even
strongly recommending, system administrators to install the usrmerge
package which will transition an legacy directory hierarchy to be /usr
merged.  So at the moment, Debian packages need to support both merged
and non-merged configurations, which is not ideal from a pacakge
maintainer's POV.
