I suspect that releasing source to virtually any substantial, recent
commercial Unix is a hideous political nightmare.  They almost
certainly have code that came from many other companies, under lots of
different license agreements, none of which were designed to allow for
open source distribution, and every one of which has to be looked at
very carefully in case someone pops up and sues.  And all the code
will have been mangled together in all sorts of exciting ways.

I remember that getting BSD 4.x released was a huge saga, and SunOS4
is bound to be much worse politically.

Surely small Sun3s should be easy to come by?  They were until
recently, anyway.
