Message-ID: <Pine.BSI.4.64.0804240837140.20990@malasada.lava.net>

I've started an SVN for the OCR'd results:

    http://code.google.com/p/unix-jun72/

if anyone needs commit access email me your account name.  I've already 
assigned some blocks to people.  If you want a block either claim it in 
the notes.txt file or email me and I'll add it.  Also if you have plans to 
perform raw OCRs of large sections of the original doc, please let me know 
or make a note of it in the notes.txt file.
