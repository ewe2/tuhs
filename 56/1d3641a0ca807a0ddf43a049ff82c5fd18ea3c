reminded me that Vic Vyssotsky liked to say of his BLODI (block diagram)
language for simulating sample-data systems that it was the only card-safe
language. You could toss a program deck down the stairs, pick it up at the
bottom, submit it to the compiler, and it would work. That was 10 years
before the filing of the famous "natural order" patent on spreadsheets,
which ordered execution the same way.
