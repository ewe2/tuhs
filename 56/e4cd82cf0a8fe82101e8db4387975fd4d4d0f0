Yes, I noticed the similarity too.

That was the trouble; had he bothered to test it on a private network (as 
if a true professional would even consider carrying out such an act)[*] he 
would've noticed that his probability calculations were arse-backwards, 
and so spread much faster than it "should" have.

Yep.  Don't use fixed-length buffers unless you *know* that it will
not overflow (i.e. the data is under your control), and don't trust
user input (especially if the reader is an interpreter with the
possibility of spawning a shell); there are of course others.

This is what you get when people call themselves programmers because
they once took a course in programming or read a book; that's like
calling oneself a doctor because you took a first-aid course...

One of my favourite examples is "Barbie the Computer Engineer" (grep the 
net for it, but warning: the title contains a naughty word).

Oh, OK; here's a sanitised URL:

    http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2014/11/barbie-fks-it-up-again/

Yes, that really is the URL; I've just tested it (but contents may offend
some viewers; you have been warned).

[*]
And for those who slagged me off for calling him an idiot, try this quick 
quiz: on a scale from utter moron to sheer genius, what do you call 
someone who deliberately releases untested software designed to compromise 
machines that are not under his administrative control in order to make 
some sort of a point?  I don't know about other countries, but try that in 
Australia and you'd be seriously out of pocket and/or doing porridge.
