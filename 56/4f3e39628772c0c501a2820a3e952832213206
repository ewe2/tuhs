You'd have to ask ken why he chose the characters he did, but I can answer
the second question. The beginning and end of line are the same. If you
make ^ mean both beginning and end of line, what does this ed command do:

s/^/x/

Which end gets the x?

<br>
I&#39;m interested in the early design decisions for meta characters<br>
in REs, mainly regarding Ken&#39;s RE implementation in ed.<br>
<br>
Two questions:<br>
<br>
1) Circumflex<br>
<br>
As far as I see, the circumflex (^) is the only meta character that<br>
has two different special meanings in REs: First being the<br>
beginning of line anchor and second inverting a character class.<br>
Why was it chosen for the second one? Why not the exclamation mark<br>
in that case? (Sure, C didn&#39;t exist by then, but the bang probably<br>
was used to negate in other languages of the time, I think.)<br>
<br>
2) Symbol for the end of line anchor<br>
<br>
What is the reason that the beginning of line and end of line<br>
anchors are different symbols? Is there a reason why not only one<br>
symbol, say the circumflex, was chosen to represent both? I<br>
currently see no disadvantages of such a design. (Circumflexes<br>
aren&#39;t likely to end lines of text, neither.)<br>
<br>
I would appreciate if you could help me understand these design<br>
decisions better. Maybe there existed RE notations that were simply<br>
copied ...<br>
