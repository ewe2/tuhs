Subject: [TUHS] OpenLook CDs in the Unix Archive
Message-ID: <20130122235721.GA9292@www.oztivo.net>

Hi all,
	Arnold Robbins has donated a couple of OpenLook CDs to the Unix
Archive. I've put them into Applications/OpenLook.

Here is his note:

	I have a CD from ian at darwinsys.com dated 9/2005 with
	OpenLook-XView-1.0e on it, and what looks like another one with
	the same date with version 1.2.  I'm still extracting the first
	one onto disk; it's in the 550+ Megabyte range. Files are dated 1995.

Right now it's only on minnie until the mirrors pick it up:

Cheers & thanks Arnold & Ian,
	Warren
