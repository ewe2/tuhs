Yeah, you're right. I was thinking of the 2.9BSD code which only does the backup
in certain cases and when stack parameter mode was used (the 0200 bit), but
stating it like I did is indeed incomplete to say the least.

Another difficulty in stock V6 would be code like this:
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V6/usr/source/s4/chmod.s
where the data at label 9: could be overwritten by a signal handler
and re-executing the sys call would not work as intended.
