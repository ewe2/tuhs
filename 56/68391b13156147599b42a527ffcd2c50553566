Subject: [TUHS] Another mail list idea
Message-ID: <20170926062610.GA5298@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, I just had a whole bumch of gmail addresses disabled on the TUHS
list because of DKIM. I had an idea. I'll create a second list which
munges the From: line. E-mail to tuhs at tuhs.org will go to both lists.
I'll move the gmail people over to the munging list.

This is just a test e-mail to see if the munging list works. I'm the only
one on it. If it seems to work, I'll move the gmail folk over.

Cheers, Warren
