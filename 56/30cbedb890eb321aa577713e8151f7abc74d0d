You (specifically) don't see a lot of evolutionary paths beyond
Linux because you're not looking for them.  There is a lot of
innovation happening in illumos and BSD.  Thanks to the
aforementioned rms, Linux has been about evangelism almost from
the start.  The illumos and BSD communities are more focused on
great engineering rather than proselytization.  Let Linux have
the fame; everyone who wants to do great work (that Linux users
will then want to steal, and then gripe about because of
licensing FUD) is elsewhere.
