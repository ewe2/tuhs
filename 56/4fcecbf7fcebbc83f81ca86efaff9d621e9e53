Does the AT&T have a serial port?

Kermit would be the way I'd go, but since you say you have nothing with 
serial ports, that could be a problem. A cheap usb-to-serial port might 
be in order. Then you can run Kermit 95 on a Windows 7 or earlier 
machine. (might work on later OS's too, but it's not supported)

The flip side is how to get Kermit onto the DOS machine.

I used a floppy recovery service a while back to read my old Commodore 
64/PET disks - he was relatively inexpensive, and very responsive.
