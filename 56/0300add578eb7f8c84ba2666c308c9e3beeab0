We worked with Apollo for a few years before they got absorbed into HP. =20
   I had a DN10000 wthat we used to use.   Amusingly, the window system=20
was some X variant with the Apollo's idea of a GUI wrapped around it.  =20
When I fired up the Motif Window Manager I found that the three little=20
windows at the bottom of the screen got their own Motif border.

The DN10000 came with a great set of documentation in five volumes to=20
describe all aspects of the hardware.   I really needed volume 3 which=20
covered the graphics system.   After much hunting around (even by some=20
senior Apollo engineers) everybody came to the conclusion that Volume 3=20
never got written.   The other cute thing is that when you opened the=20
latchless gull wing doors on the thing it powered off.   I had to tape=20
signs on the thing warning people not to open the thing casually.

A few years after HP shutdown the whole Apollo domain thing, I was=20
visiting an FAA facility and they showed me this "brand new system they=20
just got in."   It was essentially the system that eventually powered=20
things like flightaware.com.   It was running on the new obsolete DN300.

The other humerous (to me at least) was when we visited the factory,=20
they listed my bosses title as "Present" on the agenda.   We're not sure=20
what Steve did, but he was always there.
