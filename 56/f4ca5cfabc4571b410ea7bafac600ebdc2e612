I may be wrong but I thought there was a version of 'pi' for debugging
code running on the Blit/Jerq. Does that run in the emulator?

Hello folks,<br>

I realized I should mention this here on TUHS, since it is likely of<br>

I wrote it because DMD 5620s are becoming incredibly rare, and showing<br>

This emulator is using ROM version 2.0 (8;7;5) dumped from my personal<br>
