That's an interesting document, but it refers to the Z1, not the Z3.
But Wikipedia confirms that the Z3 also didn't have conditional
instructions.

Conditional branch is only one way to do that, of course.  The PDP-8,
for example, didn't have one, just (like many machines of the day)
conditional skip instructions.
