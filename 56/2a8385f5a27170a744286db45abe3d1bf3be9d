That is what the =E2=80=9CV6 with TCP=E2=80=9D on TUHS is:

Following the success of NCP Unix, it became a base for various TCP =
experiments in the =E2=80=9977-=E2=80=9979 era. The first was an =
implementation by Jack Haverty, that wrapped an existing TCPv2 stack =
that was written in PDP-11 assembler into a Unix application. It ran in =
user mode and depended on Rand ports and several extensions that Jack =
added to the kernel (await/capac and a user mode timing variable, where =
the clock routine incremented a variable in user space). He used a =
PDP-11 with little core and the pipes (ports) did not stay in the file =
buffers, but flushed onto disk. This killed performance: Jack recalls =
that a bad run would average a few characters per second.

Next Mike Wingfield wrote a TCPv4 stack in C, more or less using the =
architecture of the above. It was the =E2=80=9Cwinner" of the December =
1979 bake-off. I think it is the first TCPv4 implementation for Unix and =
maybe the oldest surviving source for TCPv4 overall. I wanted to try if =
it would still interoperate with modern TCP/IP, but I never got around =
to that. An actual printout survives in the SRI archives and I =
painstakingly retyped that source, just weeks before Noel found the =
right tapes :^). Later still, Craig Partridge found a full report and =
listing in the BBN archives (report no. 3724). This NCP Unix with the =
Wingfield library is the version that is labeled =E2=80=9CBBN V6 with =
TCP=E2=80=9D on TUHS.

Some of the code in the Wingfield stack is to test the protocol. Arpanet =
essentially offers circuit switching, and some of the code is there to =
simulate dropped packets, out-of-order packets, etc. It also tested =
security features that were under consideration, but subsequently =
dropped as interest shifted to end-to-end encryption.

Again, user mode TCP was not found to be practical, the 16-bit era was =
ending and that is when Rob Gurwitz was assigned to write a new stack =
for the VAX (1980). By that time Jack Haverty was his boss. Some parts =
of the BBN VAX-TCP design still echo the user space origins and =
experiences of the BBN team in the immediate years before. This stack I =
got working and it still interoperates with modern TCP/IP (at least it =
did some 5 years ago).

Jack Haverty can easily be reached via the internet-history mailing =
list.

I=E2=80=99ve summarised the history here: =
http://chiselapp.com/user/pnr/repository/TUHS_wiki/wiki?name=3Dearly_netwo=
rking
I should transfer it to the TUHS wiki or to Gunkies one of these days.

=3D=3D=3D

I am not sure I understood which files are missing or corrupted and in =
which NCP Unix trees. Noel retrieved the files from old (mouldy even) =
tapes so some corruption is quite possible. Pulling together material =
from various sources can hopefully lead to a working source tree. Glad =
to help.

Further note that NCP Unix was initially developed on 5th Edition, but =
soon migrated to 6th edition. I am sure that the various installations =
tracked new developments and installed extra bits and pieces. The =
surviving images are from 1979 and for sure would have picked up bits =
from newer releases and other sources (such as the Uni of Calgary buffer =
extensions).
