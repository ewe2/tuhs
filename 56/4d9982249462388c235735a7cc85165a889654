Had Ken thought that way, Unix's universal byte-addressable file format
would never have happened; this mailing list would not exist; and we
all might still be fluent in dialects of JCL. dd was sufficient glue
to bridge the gap between Unix and **Most** Operating Systems.
Meanwhile everyday use of Unix was freed from the majority's folly.
