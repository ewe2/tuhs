Registrars are a late 1990s concept :-) They are a consequence of the
effort to break up the Network Solutions monopoly - the IAHC and the
foundation of ICANN. (Another consequence was the introduction of new
TLDs.) The early technical mechanism underpinning this policy decision was
the registry-registrar protocol (RRP, RFC 2832) which has a much more
straightforward name (and design) than its successor EPP, the extensible
provisioning protocol.
