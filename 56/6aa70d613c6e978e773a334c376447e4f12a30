A =E2=80=9Cfile=E2=80=9D descriptor is very much like a capability, a handle=
.
This is separate from hierarchical naming intended for humans.
They are both needed. An ability to name something doesn=E2=80=99t
give you an automatic right to access it. And you don=E2=80=99t always
need to name something. For instance creating a pipe. The
third feature was capturing IO operations to a rather diverse set
of devices and files in a relatively simple interface. The fourth
feature that first attracted me first to Unix was its simple scheme
of major, minor device numbers. The =E2=80=9Celegance=E2=80=9D of Unix was t=
hat
you could get a lot done using a few abstractions. They were not
perfect but were good enough for the most part.
