This was my fault, and it happened because I confronted DMR about the -u
flag for cat. He said it was there because it seemed important that cat be
writable in stdio, which was new at the time. I agreed but said the point
had been made and avoiding unnecessary flags was a higher goal. So cat was
simplified to do what it said, no more and no less, with read and write and
no nonsense.
