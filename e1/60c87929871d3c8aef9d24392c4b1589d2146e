Fsck was very much a CMU program. I had a small hand in it - the reason why
the errors Messages are upper case in fact. (a different story).    That
said it was hardly a new idea - Ted modelled it from a similar program he
saw at UMich on MTS and one I ran on TSS called the file system checker.
 im guessing there may have been other programs like it.

Before fsck Ken had icheck ncheck and dcheck.  IIRC Masheys team in PWB @
Whippany I think, wrote fsdb which shows up around the same time     I also
think the Columbus folks may have something early on also.

Ted took fsck back To USG and it became part of the Summit releases.  Bill
Joy had been his roommate at Michigan which I think is how to made to ucb.
But Joy had it there before I showed up.
