Indeed, I remember this.  It was either at the UDEL or UToronto meeting =
if I recall

I also remember a talk from a fledgling Microsoft group (when all =
Microsoft was known for at the time was BASIC).

It was also at the UDel conference where MIke Muuss got booed for =
announcing he was from the Army=E2=80=99s lead laboratory in =
Vulnerability and Lethality analysis.

I also remember this guy getting booed off the stage for making a =
commercial sales pitch.    Years later I=E2=80=99m having dinner with =
Mark Krieger (then of UniPress) and it dawned on me:
You were the one who got booed at UDel.   He said he had been half of =
Whitesmiths.   I laughed.    I recounted when I saw their VMS C compiler =
came with a license =E2=80=9Cstamp=E2=80=9D you were supposed to stick =
on your machine.
I wanted to know if that was so when the Whitesmith=E2=80=99s police =
came by they=E2=80=99d know we were licensed.  He said he was gone by =
that point and that was how he knew Plauger had gone over the edge.

I was working at Rutgers at the time and on a visit to a site on the =
Newark canvas I found someone actually stuck one of these stamps on the =
CPU there.   I carefully peeled it off and gave it to Mark for =
sentimental reasons.
