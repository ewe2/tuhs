Should answer. It's up and running... unless someone's made a mess around
here with the firewall. I'll ask our network manager when she arrives this
morning.

Meanwhile, as someone else noticed, www.es.embnet.org should work as well
(it's a different computer but both share disks). Indeed both of them are
waiting to be phased out as soon as the upper level DNS admin approves the
changes.

Sorry for the delay in answering, on this side of the pond it was already
after hours, and this being the last day of Holidays of my brother at my 
home (he's flying now back to America) I didn't look up my e-mail from
home.
