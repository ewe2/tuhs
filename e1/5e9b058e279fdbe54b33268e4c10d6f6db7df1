op dst, src is Intel syntax.  AT&T syntax has op src, dst like MACRO-11.
There are a number of other differences: (a) | instead of / or # as a comment
character (b) different mnemonics (beq instead of je) and (c) # instead of $
as the comment character.

Without seeing some more code, I'd say it's not AT&T syntax.

Will have a look!

Thank you for trying to dig up the source.

OpenWatcom still works, but it's not too compatible.
