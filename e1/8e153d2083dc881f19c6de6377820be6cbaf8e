This has now been worded to make it obvious that masking off bits is not 
permitted - except for the historic UNIX wait()/waitpid() interfaces.

SUSv2 is the standard with the correct text:

Here is a part of it's wait() description:

WEXITSTATUS(stat_val)
    If the value of WIFEXITED(stat_val) is non-zero, this macro evaluates to 
the low-order 8 bits of the status argument that the child process passed to 
_exit() or exit(), or the value the child process returned from main(). 

from the signal.h description:

int           si_status exit value or signal

So masking is only mentioned for wait() and waitpid()

In SUSv2, it did just describes the waitid() interface without mentioning that
there is a mask. People at that time seem to believe that everybody knows that
si_status is a full int.

Note that the WEXITSTATUS() macro does not apply to waitid().

Later, the wrong masking text has been added.

POSIX never introduced own inventions, but rather standardizes existing 
features. The siginfo/waitid() interface has been introduced by SVr4 in 1989 
and platforms that correctly implement SVr4 compliance of course all return the 
full int.

Apple seem to have known that the compliance test did only check for

	"more than 8 bits"

by using a 16 bit exit() value in the tests...
