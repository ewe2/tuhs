Wow, I've had the opposite experience.  I find lex/yacc/flex/bison really
easy to use.  The issue, which I believe was covered in the early docs,
is that some languages are not designed with regularity in mind which makes
for ugly code.  But to be fair, that code is at least as ugly with hand-crafted
code.

I believe that the original wisecrack was directed towards FORTRAN.  My ancient
experience was that it was using lex/yacc for HSPICE was not going to work so I
had to hand-craft code for that.
