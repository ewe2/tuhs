You might want to wait for 8.0, it's supposed it'll be a big release.

-f/-F is a nonstandard (i.e. non-POSIX) option. BSDs have -f, GNU
Coreutils (and BusyBox, which most of the time copies GNU behaviour)
do have -F. Other Unix userlands (IRIX, HP-UX, Heirloom, Solaris(?))
don't have it at all. So, it's not a Penguin OS thing.


Cheers!
