That can't be right.  Bc was just an overlay to dc that parsed bc
language, compiled it into dc language, and fed dc from a pipe (all the
output was direct from dc).  So the arithmetic capabilities were exactly
the same.

I note that bc first appeared just about when bas(1) disappeared, so
perhaps there is a connection in their names.
