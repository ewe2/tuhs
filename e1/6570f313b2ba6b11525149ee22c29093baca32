Yep; his USENET fame did not go to his head.  And if my failing memory 
serves me correctly, he wrote C-News in conjunction with Geoff Collier, as 
B-News was starting to show its age and limitations.  All of which of 
course got blown away when NNTP arrived...

There was an infamous USENET forgery of him, complete with his style and 
diction, and Henry actually congratulated the forger!

Sigh; those were the days...  Now everything is based upon instant 
gratification by the kiddie brigade (overnight batch jobs on ye olde 
360/50, anyone?).
