Further to the below, I=E2=80=99ve now tried to build the Blit toolchain =
(on a contemporary OS). Other than the usual little issues, it does not =
take too much effort to get running.

Rebuilding the rom contents using the pre-existing libraries builds the =
exact same bits, however here is also where the good stuff ends: this =
only assembles two files, compiles vitty.c and the rest is library; =
rebuilding the libraries is different.

The roms rely on four libaries (libsys, libj, liblayer and libc) and =
none of the four rebuild to the exact same bytes or size. In several =
cases the archives do not even have the exact same files in them. In =
general, the regenerated object files often appear to be a little =
smaller (even when compiled with optimization off). So far I cannot tell =
whether this is because the compiler is different, or because the =
underlying source code is different. Probably a bit of both.

So, it would seem that an adapted rom can be compiled, but how =
functional it would be remains to be seen.

The note about the missing compiler remains intriguing. First a =
correction: I associate =E2=80=9Cccom=E2=80=9D with the DMR compiler, as =
it lives in a directory by that name; I had not realized that pcc also =
names its main binary ccom. Beyond that it would seem that two different =
versions of this 68K compiler were floating around and maybe the =
surviving one puts different debug info in the symbol table.
