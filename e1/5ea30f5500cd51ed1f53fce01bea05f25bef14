​I would think so.​

​I can not say.  I'm sure who that would have been.​  The Locus AIX/370 was
mostly in LA [lead by Bruce Walker and late Gerry Popek].

IMO: The issue was less understanding how channels worked, as much as the
biasing between the UNIX I/O model *vs.* the mainframe I/O model.   360 and
CDC boxes for that matter, were a coprocessor that was programmed for the
I/O.   Figuring out how to splice that into the UNIX world efficiently was
not always easy.

I fought this war many times over my career.   Often it was just easier to
have a lot of really fast similar processors in the main CPU.   The idea
being that if you have enough of them and anyone will do, you don't have to
think about it/do anything special in the SW.

In the the case of the IBM channel or the CDC PPUs, or even later the
Masscomp machines, if you have these coprocessors that can do a lot of the
work for you, but are not as fast as or as flexible as the main processor,
what is best to process what part of the I/O where?

In the case of the MC500 the network processor was a 186 then a 286, and we
ran the TCP stack on it so the host would not have to do anything.   By the
time of the MC5000, we just ran the 286 as a very large packet buffer but
could smooth out packet or interrupt storms, which was the same trick we
did on the CDC Cyber years earlier (the PPU  had monitored the network link
the same way).

I believe that AIX/370 struggled with some of those same choices.
