This is getting a little off topic ...

There are still lots of motivated people. I found for myself that
working on security products is very motivating; you're developing something
that people really NEED, that protects them and their assets, and
it's IMPORTANT, not just adding another shiny gadget onto Word or
whatever.

So, do I care about code quality? Very much. My workplace does too.

That said, work/life balance is a real issue. I work to feed my family
and keep a roof over their heads.  Of course I want to enjoy my work
and feel value from it, but out of necessity I've spent a lot of time
where it wasn't so good. I'm fortunate that today it's good on both
ends. :-)
