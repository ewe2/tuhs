SETTING UP UNIX âˆ’ Sixth Edition is as official as it gets. There is
the issue with the non-existing man command. What are other things
you are missing? I'll gladly flesh out a simh EXPECT/SEND .ini with
comments and more things than just the bare install it currently
does.

I initially wrote it to demo V6&BSD, running in simh, in linux,
in jor1k, in javascript, in your browser. Unfortunately, anno 2016,
it is too slow for prime time. The great thing about the builtin
EXPECT/SEND is that it is easy to test if cookbook actually works.
