Random832:

  The existence of cd as a real command is a bit silly (Ubuntu doesn't
  seem to bother with it), but it is technically required by the standard.

===

Just for the record, Fedora 21 supplies /bin/cd, as part
of package bash-4.3.42-1.  Interestingly, it is a shell
script:

lu$ cat /bin/cd
#!/bin/sh
builtin cd "$@"
lu$ 

As has been said here, it's hard to see the functional point.

Others have remarked on the continued life of /bin/true and
/bin/false.  There are some who use those as shells in /etc/passwd
for logins that should never actually be allowed to do anything
directly.  I have no strong personal feeling about that, I'm just
reporting.

And to be fair (as has also already been displayed here), the
copyright notice inserted in the once-empty /bin/true was hundreds
of bytes long, not thousands.  Let us call out silliness, but let
us not make it out as any sillier than it actually is.
