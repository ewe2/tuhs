Subject: [TUHS] looking for 4.3BSD Berkeley software License Agreement
Message-ID: <alpine.NEB.2.01.1011100944310.29574@t1.m.reedmedia.net>

Anyone have a scanned (or text) copy of the 4.3BSD License Agreement 
from 1986 they can send me?

Much of the code shipped in 4.3BSD says ``The Berkeley software License 
Agreement specifies the terms and conditions for redistribution.'' As 
far as I can see, it is not included in the source, nor in the Univ. of 
Wisconsin fork, and not in Tahoe release.

I do have the agreement between UC and AT&T and copies of some of their 
letters during that period clarifying the licensing.

The Net1 release included the license agreement in the source files. But 
does anyone have a separate license agreement for Net1 too? (The README 
seems to imply there was a separate license agreement too.)

I am also looking for addendum for Tahoe and the addendum for Reno. And 
was there any agreement to sign for those who chose to pay for statement 
that Net2 was freely redistributal (I guess that wouldn't make sense)?
