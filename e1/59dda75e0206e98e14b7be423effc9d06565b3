Rich was kind enough to look through the Joyce papers to see if it =
contained "CSRG Tech Report 4: Proposals for Unix on the VAX=E2=80=9D. =
It did.

As list regulars will know I=E2=80=99ve been looking for that paper for =
years as it documents the early ideas for networking and IPC in what was =
to become 4.2BSD.

It is an intriguing paper that discusses a network API that is imo =
fairly different from what ended up being in 4.1a and 4.2BSD. It =
confirms Kirk McKusick=E2=80=99s recollection that the select statement =
was modelled after the ADA select statement. It also confirms Clem =
Cole=E2=80=99s recollection that the initial ideas for 4.2BSB were =
significantly influenced by the ideas of Richard Rashid =
(Aleph/Accent/Mach).

Besides IPC and networking, it also discusses file systems and a wide =
array of potential improvements in various other areas.
