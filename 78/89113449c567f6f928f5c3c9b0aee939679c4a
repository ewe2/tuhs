<Raises hand>

The normal reason why I'm starting subshells is because I need to
control various environment variables on an ad-hoc basis.  It might be
PYTHONPATH, KRB5CCNAME, GPG_AGENT_INFO, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or some
combination of the above.  Back when I was regularly using Kerberos
root/admin bits, I had some hard-coded shell aliases to indicate
explicitly I was in a shell that was using my
tytso/root@ATHENA.MIT.EDU or tytso/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU kerberos
tickets.

But for ad-hoc use cases, SHLVL is great way to track whether I'm a
non-standard shell environment.  For me, some use case probably comes
up at least week or two.

Before I was using bash regularly, I had hard-coded something like
SHLVL in my .tcshrc.
