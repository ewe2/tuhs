Here's a start.

I did the 10 pages of section E00.  It took me about
3-4 hours.  The files should probably be reviewed, so I'm estimating
about 5 hours of work for 10 pages.

If other people are interested in committing their time, I'll commit to 
another 10 pages plus reviewing 10 pages of someone elses work if someone 
will review my work.
