From 1984, when I stopped using vi (vee eye), until the early 1990's, when
I could use Sam, I used a slightly hacked version of ed. I added
what the Labs called the "b" command. I had use some other character. Denni=
s
Ritchie sent me a 8th Edition Unix manual, and I saw they had added almost
the same thing and called the command by the second letter. Vi called
it the last letter, "z."=20

I've never found ed slows me down. Some things I would have used awk/sed
for that I now use Sam's command window for, but that's a bad thing. I stil=
l
use ed a lot along side Sam.
