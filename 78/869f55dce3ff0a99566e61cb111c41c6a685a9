For my taste, the various Unix file system switches that I've seen are too
firmly tied to the idea of blocks and disks and all that, making them less
flexible than they should have been. That's why the Plan 9 version is about
names and byte streams, to make it as general as possible.

That's one of the reasons the possibilities of the file system approach to
data has not reached its potential in Unix.
