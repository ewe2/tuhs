On CDC machines, the return jump (RJ) instruction generally used to call subroutines deposited a jump instruction (EQ B0,B0,caller+1) in the called routine and jumped to the word after it.  Clearly, languages like Pascal didn’t use that.

I seem to recall that the CDC SORT routine built and executed sort computations in memory, a la bitblt, which came a few years later. Of course, CDC had no concept of I and D space.  We aren’t talkin’ Burroughs here….
