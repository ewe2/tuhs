I don't consider myself to be an 80 column person.  -  I default my 
XTerm windows to 132 x 50.  (Rows matter less.)

I don't know if it plays into preferences or not, but I do find that 
having things on one line makes it significantly easier to 
programmability modify the line with a Regular Expression.

Maybe I need to learn some more about RE's to make working across lines 
easier.

My $EMPLOYER does have CR processes that complain about lines longer 
than 80 characters.

Interesting.  I wonder if that's where the 132 column (alternative) 
standard came from.  I.e. XTerm's "Allow 80/132 Column Switching" option 
in the VT Options menu.
