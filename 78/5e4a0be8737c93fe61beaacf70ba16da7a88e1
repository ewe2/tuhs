Well, sometimes.  BA23 box was used for VAXstations, but there was also the
BA123 box, which looks more like a dogs house.  

Both my BA23 11/73 and my BA123 MicroVAX are in my storage downstairs
otherwise I would make some pictures.

The PRO series ran P/OS (really.. weird acronym).  I think there used to be
an Ultrix variant for them too.  Never used that, did use P/OS while I was
at DEC in the late 80s for my graduation work.

Pro350 was an 11/23 CPU (F11??), the Pro380 was an 11/73 CPU (J11?)
