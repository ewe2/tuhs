I think it might have been in the original COFF which came from those days, but its possible its from one of the many bastardization of COFF that occurred after its birth.    I don't remember it being in any of the a.out flavors and I don't think macho has it.

My recollection is that this was driven by (late) Larry Loucks, with assistance from Jack O???Quin and several of the ISC folks.

What was the underlying technology that enabled them in AIX?
