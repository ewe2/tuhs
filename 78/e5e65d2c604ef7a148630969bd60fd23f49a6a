Noel,

Regarding the boards, the non-DEC one is the 16kW board I bought installed
in the '03, so I guess that works fine.

I managed to follow instructions for SimH and install and configure a V6
system. Was quite satisfying, and was quite an education. So many lessons
in one session, a really good exercise.

I'm checking with Peter Schranz about whether or not his RLV12/RL02 boards
can run on the '03. May be a similar issue with knobbling some of the pins,
if I'm lucky.

Yes, DEC 256KB boards are what&#39;s called Q22, and those don&#39;t seem t=

LSI-11&#39;s; not even CPU ODT works. I just tried a 256KB MSV11-L with an =

probably also won&#39;t work.<br>

What the Q22 means is that early in the lifetime of the QBUS, it only had 1=

boards.<br>
<br>
My theory on what the problem is is that the LSI-11 uses some of those pins=
<br>
for other things - I think the &#39;run&#39; light, IIRC. So that confuses =
Q22 memory.<br>
If one tries to use one with an LSI-11, the machine is totally dead - not e=

ODT. It doesn&#39;t do any harm, though; unplug the Q22 memory, and plug in=
 a Q18<br>
card like an MSV11-D, and it&#39;ll be fine.<br>
<br>
If you need memory for the LSI-11, MSV11-D boards are pretty common on eBai=

Well, if it&#39;s Q22 it won&#39;t work either. Both that and the DEC board=
