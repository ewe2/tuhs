Subject: [TUHS] Installing Amix on FS-UAE, English Amiga Users's thread
Message-ID: <d39f90bf-36ad-b8d7-9365-1f47c4b938d9@gmail.com>

I'm this close to figuring out how to get netbsd to work on fs-uae with 
no prior amiga experience. Searching around the English Amiga Users's 
board for clues, I found a guide on downloading and installing Amix. 
Complete with amix download links. Haven't tried it myself -I'm still 
working on my bsd tangent. But for anyone interested:
