It was never commercial, but there was Virtue (later known as the Andrew 
Toolkit, and even later than that known as the Andrew User Interface 
System) - the windowing system developed at Carnegie Mellon University 
as part of the Andrew Project (an early campus-wide workstation 
computing initiative).  It started out as a completely self-contained 
user interface system, but (much) later was changed to use X11 to drive 
the workstation's display (in the early days of the Andrew Project, 
there was no X Window System....).

I still fondly recall using Andrew workstations (my favorites were the 
Sun-2's... :-) ) when I was working at CMU.

You could probably still find the older Virtue code if you look. Getting 
it to build on anything anymore - that's probably a more difficult 
problem.  ;-)
