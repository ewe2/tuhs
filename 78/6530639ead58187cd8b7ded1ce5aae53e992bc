Branden,

I like these intro paragraphs and the elision of the ominous
adjective, "advanced".

>  An environment is created for the footnote so that it is set at a smaller typeface.

To avoid implying that one must create an environment with each
footnote and to illustrate that environments are collections of
settings, you might say something like this

> Switch to a previously created footnote environment with a smaller typeface and distinctive line length.
