Sure.  just make the directory and add files to it and "svn add dir"
or "svn mkdir dir" and start adding files.  Either way, once you commit
it'll get pushed up.

I'm fine renaming things..  the early names were just kind of ad hoc.
though "rebuilt" should probably be named "clean" and the "build"
directory that has the patches applied should probably be "sys".
