I'm surprised that Norman Wilson hasn't spoke up about these editions. Here
is a bit of an e-mail he sent w.r.t 10th Edition a while back:
---
The system included intellectual property with five types of ownership:
a.  Stuff that came out of 4.1a (approx) BSD.
b.  Borrowings from contemporary System V, often then
worked over further within 1127, but still identifiably theirs.
(make and pcc2 are clear examples.)
c.  1127 inventions that were adopted in some recognizable
form into System V.  (Aspects of the stream I/O system, for
example.)
d.  1127 inventions that were never adopted by anyone else.
(Much of the connection server.)
e.  Chunks of third-party software that we had under various
licenses, and stored in /usr/src/cmd because we put everything
there; some public-domain, some private.

The problems involve b c d e. ...
e doesn't really matter because none of that code
matters (and in fact I have thrown it all out).  Probably nobody
is worried about d because it's all a dead end anyway from
a commercial point of view; certainly the Ancient Systems
License terms are likely to work fine.  (This is actually Dennis's
opinion too.)  b and c are the real problem: the attachment to
System V is recent enough that it is not obvious that the
Ancient Systems License applies
