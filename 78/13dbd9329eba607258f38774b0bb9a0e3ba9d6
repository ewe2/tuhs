Been reading the heirloom docs.  Remember one thing that I disliked
about troff which maybe Doug can explain.  It's the language in the
docs.  I never understood "interpolating a register" to have any
relation to the definition of interpolate that I learned in math.
Made it a bit hard to learn initially.

Any memory of why that term was used?
