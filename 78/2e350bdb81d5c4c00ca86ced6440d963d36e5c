I think that the root cause is AT&T USL.  When UNIX went from research
to "product" different people worked on it.  And those people seemed to
lack the artistry, vision, and craftsmanship of the original developers.
AT&T pushed their SVR4 crud hard onto the rest of the world.  Meanwhile,
the folks at Berkeley produced code more in the original tradition
possibly because of Ken taking a sabbatical year to teach there.  SunOS
was the result of the pipeline between Berkeley and Sun.

Solaris was the result of Sun abandoning the Berkeley branch for the USL
branch.
