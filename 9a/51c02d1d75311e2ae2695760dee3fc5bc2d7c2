Linux runs on _everything_.  From your phone to the top 500 HPC clusters.

Unix, for all that it did, never had that level of success.  I credit
Unix for a lot, including showing Linux what it should be, but Linux
took that model and ran with it.

Plan 9 is very cool but I am channeling my inner Clem, Plan 9 didn't meet
Clem's law.  It was never compelling enough to make the masses love it.
Linux was good enough.

We can argue about if that is a good thing or not, I've watched Linux
become more complex and seen docker et al react to that.
