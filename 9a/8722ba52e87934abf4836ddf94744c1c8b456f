For general information on CTSS, the grandparent of Unix, see
<http://www.multicians.org/thvv/7094.html>.
Unfortunately, all it says about RUNCOM is:

    Louis Pouzin also invented RUNCOM for CTSS. This facility,
    the direct ancestor of the Unix shell script, allowed users
    to create a file-system file of commands to be executed, with
    parameter substitution. Louis also produced a design for the
    Multics shell, ancestor of the Unix shell.

That's a great site for everything Multics-related, and has a lot of
ancestral stuff that we've mostly heard about from the Bell Labs side.
