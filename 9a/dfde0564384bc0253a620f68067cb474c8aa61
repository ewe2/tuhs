# bas
i=25
print i
2.50000000e1
for i = 1 10 print i next
1.00000000e0
2.00000000e0
3.00000000e0
4.00000000e0
5.00000000e0
6.00000000e0
7.00000000e0
8.00000000e0
9.00000000e0
1.00000000e1

So, that's asm, C, fortran, basic, and shell: 5 languages.

I'm sure we could get ed and roff to perform as turing machines, but
I will leave that as an exercise for the reader :-)
