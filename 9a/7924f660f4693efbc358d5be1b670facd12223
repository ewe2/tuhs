Not to be pedantic but the OSF/1 =E2=80=9Cdataless=E2=80=9D trick is =
from 1993 in Jon Forrest=E2=80=99s writeup:

=
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.unix.osf.osf1/-s1xW80zXPE/OGENDhH2Sc0=
J

As one of the three people figuring out what DEC had told us was =
impossible I=E2=80=99m pretty sure we were the first - our DEC 3000/400s =
with OSF/1 T1.0 did not have enough disk space so we struggled to get =
our network operational serving /usr and /home from the =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=
=9D DEC 3000/600 which had two disks (one of which was /home).

Cheers,

Arrigo
