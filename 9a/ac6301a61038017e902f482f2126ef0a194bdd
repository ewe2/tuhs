   Pretty much, yeah, along with PS/2 (and/or whatever).  I'm surprised that 
   they chose Ed5, as Penguin/OS is normally the choice for weird devices.

It is running V5 in SIMH on the Gameboy.  Pretty nifty, however, the ARM
processor varient does not have a memory manager, so I suspect that it had
to be something simpler then one of the modern systems.  This wasn't a
bare iron port.

If you go to the page, he does not one of the early BSD systems running in
SIMH on it too.
