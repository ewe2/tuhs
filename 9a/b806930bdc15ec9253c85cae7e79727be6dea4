Subject: Request: More volunteers for PUPS Archive
Message-ID: <200004170408.OAA36672@henry.cs.adfa.edu.au>

Hi all,
	It's time to call again for volunteers to help out with the
distribution of the PUPS Archive. In particular, if you have received
a CD of the archive within the last 9 months, and you can duplicate it,
then please let me know if you are willing to distribute a few CDs a month.

We have a need for people in Asia, Japan, Australia, South America, but
I'll take anybody anywhere!

Many thanks in advance for your offers.

Cheers,
	Warren
