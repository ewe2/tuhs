The entire point of the SunOS 4.0 VM system was that the page you
saw via mmap(2) is the exact same page you saw via read(2).  It's
the page cache, it has page sized chunks of memory that cache 
file,offset pairs.

There is one, and only one, copy of the truth.  Doesn't matter how
you get at it, there is only one "it".

ZFS broke that contract and that was a step backwards in terms of
OS design.
