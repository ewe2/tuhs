It probably was the partition/slice confusion that, well, confused me,
then.  My experience, such as it was, was from the DOS world.

Although the period I am thinking of was way pre-slackware.  You had a boot
floppy and a root floppy and that was about it, I think.  I think the
kernel had MFM/RLL disk drivers for an ISA bus interface?  I remember that
I could boot the thing on the MCA machines in the lab but not actually
install it (even had I been allowed to), and I think installation was
pretty much fdisk/mkfs, extract the tarball...I don't remember how you
installed the bootloader...which I guess was already LILO at that point?
Probably just dding the bootsector to the first physical sector of the
disk?  Version 0.08 or so, maybe?

It was quite a while ago, and I was drunk for most of college, so....memory
is imprecise at best.
