I cracked a root password for a certain system, back in the ARPANET days.

If memory serves, it was 5 characters.

I was able to get my hands on the crypt() source, and figure out that 
the first part of it was intentionally "lengthy" and it just 
pre-computed a bunch of stuff on purpose. At least, that's my memory of 
it at the time.

I was able to separate that precompute part, and then loop through all 
combinations further down the crypt() function. Made it a lot faster.

Was able to crack a 5-character password in less than a week (or maybe 
it was a few days) on a VAX-11/750. Of course, it was a simple password 
consisting of lower-case alpha and no numerics.

I think the first letter of the password was "b" which helped a lot ;)

Nowadays, run hashcat on an HPC cluster and you can break a lot of stuff...
