Yes, that is my opinion and clearly yours is different.

Being as I have a huge hi-res screen, I often have other windows
open and ready to do, so all I have to do is move the mouse.

But really to me you're opening yet another can of worms, which is what
I call the "string theory school of design" where every new program
creates its own universe instead of functioning in the existing one.
I'm working on a demonstration project to illuminate a different path,
but it's gonna be a while before I have something to show.
