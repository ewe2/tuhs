Thanks for sharing, very interesting history to me.  You guys were pros..
particularly amazing to me how far ahead the machine abstractions were on
the various IBM machines (CP, S/38, VRM) compared to most of the industry.

emories here and not looking at the various papers and manuals that might i=

<br>
I joined Glenn&#39;s AFWS project July 5, 1982. There was no well defined s=
oftware plan yet. Glenn wanted to do something useful and significant, and =
proposed that we do the VRM. We had several distinct user environments in m=

with abstractions along the lines of the single level store of (Glenn&#39;s=

ta virtual memory chip, yet still heavily influenced by CP/CMS. After a few=
 months, Al Chang, primary person behind CP.R, came to Austin for a design =
review of what we&#39;d done. He told Glenn he&#39;d grade our work &quot;C=

<br>
We scaled back our ambitions dramatically, started working with ISC. About =
the time (1983) of the transition from &quot;ad tech&quot; to &quot;product=
&quot; organization, it became clear that our virtual memory manager needed=
 to be scrapped and we lifted what Al had done for CP.R and put it in the V=
RM.<br>
<br>
In hindsight, the VRM turned out better than it might have. Besides AIX the=
re was a version of Pick for VRM that sold about 4000 copies according to <=

<br>
Anecdotal comments on other TUHS/COFF discussions:<br>
<br>
If I recall correctly, pcc, eventually including the HCR optimizing phase, =
was bundled with base AIX. Initially, the C compiler based on the PL.8 comp=
iler would only run on CMS, so it was not generally available outside of IB=
M, but app vendors, especially CAD vendors, were enabled and encouraged to =
come to Austin to use it to get the best performance. The native C compiler=
 based on PL.8 compiler concepts ended up being a complete rewrite, outside=
 of Yorktown, and sold as a separate product.<br>
<br>
Producing software products, getting them released, priced, etc. was very c=
onfusing to me most of the time I was at IBM. Part of it was the history th=
at Clem has cited. Part of it was confusion about the antitrust suits again=
st IBM. Part of it was confusion about whether and what software was patent=
able. Academics and others wanted access to the modeling &amp; simulation s=

uot;Research Distributed Program&quot; was agreed upon and RESQ was the fir=

 However, we were forced to price RESQ much higher than I thought reasonabl=

<br>
When OSF was announced, with the intention of making AIX source available t=
