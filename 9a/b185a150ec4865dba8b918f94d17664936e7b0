There's also Margo's paper on LFS, which added logging to UFS, though
by the time it was over it wasn't recognizable.

https://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sd93/seltzer.pdf

The Journaled updates, though, is that someone added an intent log to
UFS + SoftUpdates. This was used to replay the last few operations
when doing fsck coming back up after a crash. There's also something
called gjournal, which adds a different type of journaling to UFS, but
the less said about that train-wreck the better.
