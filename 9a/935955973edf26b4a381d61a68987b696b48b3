It's the Processor Status Word, which contained the CPU's hardware priority

I wonder why it was written as "0177776->integ", rather than "*017776"?
Probably the former allowed the C compiler to work out what size the operand
was. (BTW, 'integ' was declared in a structure declaration as follows:

    struct {
	int	integ;
    };

(Did the code looked at actually say "0177776->int"? The compiler might have
barfed on a reserved keyword being used like that.)
