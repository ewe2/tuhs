Yes. There's no actual code in the System V or earlier kernels to block any
of the sync calls. At least none I could find in examining all the 'leaked
sources' I could find on the internet.

sync just schedules I/O. There's nothing in the system call that waits for
anything: it just goes through the list of all non-busy buffers calling the
driver's strategy routine and marking the buffer as busy.

Later systems, like SunOS did have a wait, but that was a later addition,
done a half a dozen different ways. BSD had one that waited for a while,
but gave up after some tens of seconds...
