I took 6.001 (with Scheme) in the spring of 1983, which was using a =
course
handout version of what became Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs by Sussman and Abelson. My impression was that it had been
around for a year before that, but not much more, and it was part of
revamping the EECS core curriculum at the time.

In at least the early 80s, CLU was used in 6.170, Software Engineering
Laboratory, in which a big project was writing a compiler.

And Fortran was still being taught for the other engineering =
departments.
In 1982(ish), those departments had the Joint Computing Facility for a =
lot
of their computing, of which the star then was a new VAX 11/782.
