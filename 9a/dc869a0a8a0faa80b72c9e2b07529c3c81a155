Warner and I have been going back and forth about this.  We're both pretty
sure that shared libs were part of the 4.0 release (that was the release
that had the VM system rewrite by Joe Moran (mojo at sun.com) with mmap() as
invisioned by Bill Joy while still at Berkeley.  

I've got a number of papers about it:

http://mcvoy.com/lm/papers/SunOS.shlib.pdf - that's the shared lib paper
http://mcvoy.com/lm/papers/SunOS.vm_arch.pdf - that's the VM architectue paper
http://mcvoy.com/lm/papers/SunOS.vm_impl.pdf - that's the VM implementation paper

There's other stuff there too if you are bored.  SunOS.smoosh.pdf is the basic
idea that is the under pinnings of every distributed source management system,
SunOS.tfs.pdf is Dave Hendrick's copy on write file system writeup, 
SunOS.ufs_clustering.pdf is the work I did in UFS to get platter speed perf
out of UFS, etc.  Most of that stuff is Sun stuff though there is some other
random bits.  If you are curious about any of it I can go into detain off
(or on) list.
