The login "dlw" included DLW as part of SCCS commit messages. The 
claudio entry also says "DLW". So probably David L. Wasley.

One of the files says "Wirth" and note that other files have spellings 
like "funktion", "prozedure", "konstant". So maybe all this is from 
Wirth?

I think this portlib is from Eric Allman.

I guess Thompson, Haley or Joy.

I assume you are refering to parts not from 32V...

I guess Babaoglu, maybe Juan Porcar, and Joy. Note that the TODO 
mentions code given to Joy.

I think some of the improvements came from the upstream (November 1978 
1.16 vs. January 1980's 2.00).

> usr/src/new/libI77uc 4379 5395

Files say originally P. Weinberger and modified by David Wasley.

> usr/src/cmd/versatec 3885 4271

sidebyside was written by Joy (per Len Edmondson personal 
correspondence).

> usr/games/advfiles/cave 1772 1772

It was common that some source for games weren't included.

Says originally developed by Willie Crowther and most features added by 
Don Woods (don @ su-ai). And the file says to ask "ark" for questions. I 
think was in a group called MHTSA (but I don't kno what means).

Maybe Dave Nowitz?

> usr/src/sys/stand 1350 3382

Some of this is just from 32V. I can only guess the changes were from 
Joy.

Mark Horton (see corresponding man page!)

(As a reminder to list readers ... I am authoring a very detailed book 
covering the history of Berkeley Unix. I have done interviews either by 
email, phone, and some in person with over 80 of the very 
early contributors.)
