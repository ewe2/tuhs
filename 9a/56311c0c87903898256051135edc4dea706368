Warren,

Nelson Beebe's massive UNIX bibliography is exhaustive. Perhaps linking 
to it would help folks looking for a definitive list:

http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/unix.bib

The site also has practically every UNIX related Journal's up to date 
BIBTEX entries.

That said, it's not where one would look for a selection of titles with 
annotations and I don't know if it's accessible by author, though I 
expect it probably is.

You probably can't imagine the hours that I spent hunting down the BSTJ 
papers in pdf form, thanks for adding them into the site!

Will
