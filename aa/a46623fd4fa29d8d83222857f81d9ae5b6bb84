I think this link -  https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html i- s the
best place to start. Superb exposition on the background, theory, and
implementation as well as a bit of history of how the industry lost its way
with regular expressions.

Regular expressions are beautiful, simple, and widely misunderstood.
