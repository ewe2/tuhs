The 1956 consent decree required AT&T to provide licenses
to patented technology when asked. It isn't hard to imagine that the
seven years of anti-trust litigation, culminating in the consent
decree, cast a long shadow when it came to how AT&T wrote and
enforced the UNIX licenses.

Judge for yourself whether it is fact or not:

See particularly Chapter 3, which establishes pretty clearly that
almost all of the users of the UNIX system were talking to each
other.
