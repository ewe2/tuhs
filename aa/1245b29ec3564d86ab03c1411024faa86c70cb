Was MERT anything like Victor Yodaiken's RT linux?  He did a real
time kernel that ran all of Unix as the idle process in the real
time kernel.  It was pretty slick, unfortunately Wind River bought
it and killed it so it wasn't competition to their less well thought
out system.

Victor's paper is here http://mcvoy.com/lm/papers/rtlmanifesto.pdf
