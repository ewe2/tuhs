Dude, you are talking to the guy who wrote webroff, a tool that takes -ms
markup and puts on the web.  Our website was done in webroff for years and
you could take all the source and produce a pdf.

I'm with ya.  Where I get off the boat (heh) is texinfo, it was useful in
its time, it sucks now.  I actually prefer man pages to texinfo by a long
shot.
