	Neither have I ;)   I thought (for 30 seconds or less) about 
	porting it to BSD/OS - it's not that big and didn't appear to be
	overly tricky.

	Only reason I knew about 'tap' was that P11 has support for it and
	a pointer where to fetch 'tap' from.

	Publishing an ARP entry has the benefit of not needing to wander
	around to all the systems on the LAN (I've several) and add a static 
	route.   In my case I don't own/run the local router so I couldn't 
	add a static route if I wanted to.   Having the host system 
	'arp ... pub' works was the simplest way to deal with the situation.

	Well, i'd have to see it working or have it explained in a bit more
	detail.  Having been thru the DEQNA driver and IP stack in 2.11 I
	can't see how an 11 will communicate with anything over an ethernet
	if it can't perform the IP<->ethernet address mapping.

	Ouch!  On the 11 side?  Or on the hosting system's side?

I had to replace the RS 423 drives on my PDP-11/24 and in the connected 
VT-100 terminal after a problem on a PC clobbered the 11/24 console ports 
which in turn clobbered the VT-100 some time ago.

I don't know the details either, unfortunately.  I really need to find
some time to get the thing running again.

On the 11 side.  I'm not sure what happened, but it looks like it.
It's not a big deal, since I have backups somewhere.
