Subject: [TUHS] make inn automatically accept new group control messages
Message-ID: <slrnofd53m.smn.john@nova.jfloren.net>

Looks like INN isn't quite as trusting as CNews, so it doesn't
automatically create a group when it receives a control message.
Anyone know how to make it do that, or at least email me
to notify of the new group?
