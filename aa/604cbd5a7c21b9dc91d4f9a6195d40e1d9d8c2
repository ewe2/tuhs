Pat,

I still know a few people from the 36-bit world so I could put you =
in touch, but if you really want people to understand primitives, =
you might want to start with a simpler model, e.g., 16-bit =
minicomputers like the DEC PDP-11 (smaller models), the DG Nova, =
perhaps the original mc68000 (no MMU or FPU on-chip in that).

Once you add MMUs to the picture, life gets a lot more complicated, =
and I'm pretty sure the typical applications programmer doesn't =
really need to know that class of details, but going for PDP-10 =
(more "mainframe-ish" system) is going to take them there.

	Erik
