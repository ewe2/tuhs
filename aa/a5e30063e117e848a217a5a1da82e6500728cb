I think you are more or less agreeing with the author.  (I also think, as
Unix die hards, we all bridle a little when anyone dares to say anything
negative about C.  We should resist that if it gets in the way of making
things better.)

The author at least has me thinking about how you could make a C like 
language that didn't ask as much from the hardware.
