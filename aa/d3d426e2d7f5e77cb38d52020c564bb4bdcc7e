I was an ardent OS/2 supporter for a long time.  Sure, IBM's anemic
marketing, and their close-to-outright-hostility to 3rd-party developers
didn't help.  But what killed it, really, was how damn good its 16-bit
support was.  It *was* a better DOS than DOS and a better Windows than
3.11fW.  So no one wrote to the relatively tiny market of 32-bit OS/2.

I fear that had Linux not made the leap, MS might well have won.  It's
largely the AOL-fuelled explosion of popularity of the Internet and Windows
ignoring same until too late that opened the door enough for Linux to jam
its foot in.

Hurd was, by the time of the '386 Unix Wars and early Linux, clearly not
going to be a contender, I guess because it was about cool research
features rather than running user-facing code.  I kept waiting for a usable
kernel to go with what Linux had already shown was a quite decent
userspace, but eventually had better things to do with my life (like chase
BeOS).  It was like waiting for Perl 6--it missed its moment.

Plan 9 and Amoeba were both really nifty.    I never used Sprite.  Neither
one of them had much of a chance in the real world.  Much like Unix itself,
Linux's worse-is-better approach really worked.

I have a hypothesis about Linux's ascendance too, which is a personal
anecdote I am inflating to the status of hypothesis.  As I recall, the
*BSDs for 386 all assumed they owned the hard disk.  Like, the whole
thing.  You couldn't, at least in 1992, create a multiboot system--or at
least it was my strong impression you could not.  I was an undergrad.  I
had one '386 at my disposal, with one hard disk, and, hey, I needed DOS and
Windows to write my papers (I don't know about you, but I wanted to write
in my room, where I could have my references at hand and be reasonably
undisturbed; sure Framemaker was a much better setup than Word For Windows
1.2 but having to use it in the computer lab made it a nonstarter for me).
Papers, and, well, to play games.  Sure, that too.

Linux let me defragment my drive, non-destructively repartition it, and
create a dual-boot system, so that I could both use the computer for school
and screw around on Linux.  I'm probably not the only person for whom this
was a decisive factor.
