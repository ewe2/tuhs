This is a really strange way to deal with a different memory.

Given that Larry does not even mention what he has in his memory and as his 
previous claims have only been partially verifyable, his mail must be seen as 
non-helpful.

It however may help to mention that from my memory, Larry was no longer at Sun
when Sun bought the additional rights from Novell (which happened IIRC in late 
1994).


Larry: please try to be constructive. If you believe I am wrong, explain where 
and if you have different memory, give verifyable statements. My statements are 
taken from statements from people who have been Sun employees during the time 
in question and from one of the few SCO employees that survived the SCO story 
up to xinuos.com.
