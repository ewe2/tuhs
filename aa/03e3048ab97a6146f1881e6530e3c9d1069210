I had not realised that the Research group expanded in 1980, but it =

I did realise that bit, and it made me wonder if the =E2=80=9973 burst =
was in part driven by the arrival of a 11/45.

Yes, as you may remember from this list I dove into that last November - =
schematics, tools & firmware.

Chesson=E2=80=99s MPX files remain a puzzle piece that is somewhat =

To be honest, late 1981 sounds a bit too early for the merge. The 4.1 =
code was ready in June 1981 and the =E2=80=99select=E2=80=99 system call =
was first proposed in July 1981, so it is possible. However, in the BSD =
line =E2=80=99select=E2=80=99 was not fully implemented until =
March/April 1982.

It is certainly possible, even likely, that =E2=80=98streams=E2=80=99 =
date from 1981 or earlier. Networks don=E2=80=99t mesh well with TTY =
line disciplines and clist buffering - that pain will have become =
apparent already in 1979. Maybe it was among the first things to be =
fixed when the VAX arrived.

If someday you have time for this, it would be much appreciated!
