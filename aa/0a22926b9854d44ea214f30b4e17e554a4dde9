Certainly, but the question is whether it's enough to imply causality.
I am a very fast typer, but when we got our Tandem machines back in
1977, we discovered that the shell was called COMINT and the editor
was called EDIT.  Too long for my liking, so I shortened them to C and
E respectively, much to the disgust of the field technicians.  This
was long before I was exposed to Unix, and we were really happy with
our 9600 bps ADM-2s, so much faster than the IBM 3270s we had been
using on the /370.

Even now I tend to shorten file names.  And I suspect I'm not the only
person who hates these excessively long
--options-that-could-have-been-written-more-succinctly.  Probably it's
at least partially a mentality issue.
