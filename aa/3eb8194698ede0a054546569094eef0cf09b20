TUHS Disclaimer: I will claim this is primarily about getting Unix onto
the Arpanet, but it does also contain trace amounts of off-topic
information.  Reader discretion is adviced.

The hardware interfaces between a host and an IMP came in three flavors:
local host, distant host, and very distant host.  The first two are more
or less directly connected and I forget what the difference is.  But a
very distant host is basically connected over a phone line with a modem
at each end, so it's a different beast.  The VHD driver would be for
this, whilst IMP11A and ACC are local or distant.

Side note: apparently tapes from the unique Hawaii BCC 500 have been
saved.  So maybe that's one more possible re-Arpanet host.

Here's my take:
https://gunkies.org/wiki/Network_Control_Program_(ARPANET)#Implementations

So there are like four PDP-10 systems and two PDP-11.  The ELF system
will be a major challenge, RATS haven't been scanned off the printer
listing, and the BCC 500... oh boy, let's not go there now.

I think so.  I "almost" got one running but there was some problem...

TOPS-20AN seems to be there.  TOPS-10, nothing so far.

I asked around; found nothing.  CDC, same.

Nothing for the 316/516 IMP, as far as I know.  Pluribus IMP emulator,
anyone?
