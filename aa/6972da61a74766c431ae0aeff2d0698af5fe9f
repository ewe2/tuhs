FreeBSD also has Taylor UUCP; /usr/ports/net/freebsd-uucp:

    This is a port of the Taylor UUCP Unix-to-Unix Copy Program suite
    of utilities.  This source was formerly a part of the FreeBSD base
    system, and this package is based on the final version of that
    source code, so it includes all previous FreeBSD customizations.
