The relationship with GNU & SUN would be that the SUN & VAX were the first target platforms for GCC/GAS/Binutils.  So it would have been expected that if you were running a 68000 version of GCC it’d probably be running on a SUN-2 or SUN-3.  Not to mention it was their build platform as mentioned here:

ftp://ftp.cs.purdue.edu/pub/comer/XINU-68K.README


There is some additional platforms here:

ftp://ftp.cs.purdue.edu/pub/comer

I haven’t tried to run any of it yet though.

Small clarification: The AT&T 3B1 isn't related to Suns. It was
made for AT&T by Convergent. It was a nice box; I owned one for a while
and have many happy memories thereof.

Hmmm, are there other Xinu versions in the archive?

Thanks,
