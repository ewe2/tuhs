Oh, right, I'd forgotten about that: the KS-11 - I've previously enquired to
see if anyone had _any_ documentation for this, but so far, nada.

Alas, I'd already had that idea (to try and at least re-create a programming
spec, at least, for the KS11). There do not seem to be any traces there,
perhaps because that code came from a document entitled "Preliminary Release
of Unix Implementation", which argues that it's a very early 'version' of V0
(the early 'versions' weren't very formal, there was a continuous process of
change/improvement going on, apparently).

No, they came in first for 'pure text' (0410):

  http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V4/nsys/ken/sys1.c

which I would expect arrived to minimize swapping on machines with small
amounts of real memmory.

Support for user split-I/D (411) didn't arrive until Version 6:

  http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V6/usr/sys/ken/sys1.c

although IIRC split I/D in the kernel was supported supported slightly
before it was in user - although V5 didn't:

  http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V5/usr/sys/conf/mch.s

so it couldn't have been much earlier than V6.
