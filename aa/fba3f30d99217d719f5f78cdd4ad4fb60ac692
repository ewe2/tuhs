Another small point about this: consider that `diff` et al prepend
special characters to the beginning of a line in their output. So if
one wants to run e.g., `diff -u a.c b.c`, and the line-length limit in
a source file is 80 characters, then won't one see a non-trivial
amount of either wrap-around or truncation in diff output? This,
again, begs the question of why not use a shorter line-length limit
than the presumed maximum screen width?
