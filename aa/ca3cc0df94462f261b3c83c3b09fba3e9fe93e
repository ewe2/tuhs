The title page is on page 42 (PDF page 8). The bottom of page 42 
continues to top of page 44:

"For the most part we stayed out of trouble, although on of our rank 
once had his phone records subpoenaed by the FBI ..."

That same article is at
http://www.mindspring.com/~cavu/85may.html

And yes that Unix Review is fun. Note that the first article was 
expanded or reused in "Berkeley UNIX Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow" 
(prior to Sept. 1993, included in lawsuit as Kennedy Aff. Ex.  8) and 
then as a chapter in O'Reilly's "Open Sources: Voices from the Open 
Source Revolution", 1st Edition, January 1999.
