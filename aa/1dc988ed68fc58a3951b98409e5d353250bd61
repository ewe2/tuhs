Didn't xkcd do a graph of alcohol consumption vs code output? Alcohol isn't
really my thing wrt drugs (I like the taste but don't prefer the effects)
so it doesn't much work for me, but talking with friends, it seems to be a
popular enough thing to do that there must be at least a little basis in
fact (obviously anecdotal too).

I know I used to better at thinking about the best way to approach
something under some influence - but that's not when you want to try to
debug stuff (friends who drink and code agree with that too).

Wrt the thrill of making something work - I dig that. OTOH, if I didn't
have to write code to see stuff get done, I probably wouldn't (or might
switch to something that is just for fun like smalltalk or make joke
projects like cobol on cogs - which is actually kinda cool).

Programming is actually an addiction. What makes it addictive to a certain
type of personality is that little rush of satisfaction when you try your
code and it *works*... and while this is still true to an extent of batch
systems from the 50s and 60s it was the interactive systems of the 70s
onwards that really spurred the development of the hacker subculture. It
was not just the convenience and productivity improvements but that the
'hit' was coming harder and faster.

This theory is well known to those who design slot machines and other forms
of gambling, it is called the theory of occasional rewards. With this in
mind, frequent long debugging sessions do not make the process any less
addictive, indeed MORE addictive since the occasional rewards are less
predictable etc. With this in mind it is unsurprising that programmers tend
to have other fixes too such as coffee, harder drugs or even gambling. Some
personalities seem to be quite susceptible to occasional-rewards things.
