I'm doing my best!

If I get it, I will make whatever sources are useful generally
available.

Dear All,
There is a complete 11/34 for sale on EBay (1 day to go).  It comes with

a complete V6 with source.

Somebody buy it please.  This is nothing to do with me, I just saw it 
tonight.  It's in Pontypridd South Wales

Cheers

Robin
