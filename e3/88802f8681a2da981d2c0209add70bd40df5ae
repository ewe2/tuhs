Well, my take on this is that C was developed with UNIX,
of course, and UNIX early on decided to use a single
character rather than a two-char (CRLF) sequence for
end-of-lines.  So, since the CR was already in use for 
the leading char in the two-char sequence, it made it a lot
easier to use the LF character for the single newline, so
programs wouldn't always have to be checking a second
character...

Regards,

Greg
