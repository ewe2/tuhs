Since i now own a (used!!) smartphone i unfortunately have to live
with such things when doing my little bit of SMS messaging.  It is
terrible.  Ooften do i have to delete the word entirely to unlock
the screen.  Ach! for the Asians who commit suicide because they
messed up a calligraphical painting.

It seems to me TUHS has lost its Sender: message header btw, which
longs for fixing as it is SHOULD in RFC 5322 in this ML case
(except for Warren himself, maybe).
