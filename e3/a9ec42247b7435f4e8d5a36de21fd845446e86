My understanding was that the 8-bit bus was a requirement so IBM could
have a 64KB base model using the then new 64kÃ—1 chips.  IBM also
emasculated the PC so it didn't compete with their existing minis.  The
68008 wasn't available until later (and this would explain why Motorola
pushed the 6809 as a solution).

Both the 8086 and M68k could relatively easily use 8-bit peripherals
(both Intel and Motorola had a range of 8-bit peripherals that they
didn't want to make instantly obsolete).

Since IBM was buying the software, I'm not sure how much of a driver
this was.  Definitely, porting from 8080 to 8086 was easier but writing
from scratch would be far easier on M68k.
