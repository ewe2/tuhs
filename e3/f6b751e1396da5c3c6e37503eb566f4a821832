One thing to remember about Mach is that it really was a *research* =
project. Some of the things that have been complained about, e.g. =
=E2=80=9Cpointless=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cneedless=E2=80=9D abstraction =
and layering, were done specifically to examine the effects of having =
those layers of abstraction. Does their presence enable different =
approaches to problems? Do they enable new features altogether? What=E2=80=
=99s given up by having them? And so on.

Just as an example, a lot of the complexity in the Mach VM system comes =
from the idea that it could provide a substrate for all sorts of =
different types of systems, and it could have all sorts of different =
mechanisms underneath supporting it. This means that Mach=E2=80=99s =
creators got to do things like try dedicated network virtual memory, =
purpose-specific pagers, compressing pagers, etc. You may not need as =
much flexibility in a non-research system.

For another example, Mach did a lot of extra work around things like =
processor sets that wouldn=E2=80=99t be needed on (say) a dual-CPU =
shared-cache uniform-memory systems, but turns out to be important when =
dealing with things like systems with a hierarchy of CPUs, caches, and =
memories. Did they know about all the possible needs for that before =
they started?

Having met some of them, the people who created and worked on Mach were =
passionate about exploring the space of operating system architecture =
and worked to create a system that would be a good vehicle for that. =
That wasn=E2=80=99t their only goal=E2=80=94they were also part of the =
group creating what was at the time CMU=E2=80=99s next-generation =
academic computing environment=E2=80=94but the sum of their goals =
generally led to a very pragmatic approach to making things possible to =
try while also shipping.
