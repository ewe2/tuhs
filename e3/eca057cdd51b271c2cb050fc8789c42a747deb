As I remember it, DEC announced the VAX in 1976 or 1977, and first
official customer ship didn't happen until 1978.  Holy Cross had one
of the hardware beta machines in 1977.  It ran a beta version of VMS
(version X0.5 initially).  I ported a bunch of programs to the VAX,
including the PDP-10 version of Adventure.
