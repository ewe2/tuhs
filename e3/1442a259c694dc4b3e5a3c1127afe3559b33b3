This is a problem that I regularly face, when keeping a global calendar.

I'm in Australia (Sydney time), which is pretty much at the leading edge 
of the dateline, but most of America is close to the trailing edge, and 
therefore events can happen "yesterday".

So, which reference should I use?  My time, US time (for US events), or 
UTC?  I'm starting to lean towards the latter, but it's equally confusing; 
I'll have people saying that it happened yesterday, by their reference.

I dimly recall that the moon landings were on GMT (not the same as UTC),
for example.
