Hi Doug,

> Surely JIT compiling must count as self-modifying code.

If it does, then my computer just runs one program from when I turn it
on.  It switches memory formats and then is forever extending itself and
throwing chunks away.

_The Story of Mel_ about self-modifying code is well known.  What some
that read it a long time ago might not know...  Mel has been identified.
