Bell Labs' decision to pull out of Multics still ranks in my mind as one
of the best management decisions I've ever had close contact with...

With respect to Dec's OSs vs Unix, I remember a visit from a Dec repair
person who ran "preventive maintenance" on our disc that wiped out the
file system!  His excuse was that Dec didn't support "permanent storage"
on the disc at the time...
