Yes -- this is the (or at least "an") argument for two-column text
on wide (8.5x11 or A4, or larger) paper pages.

I am too, but I still use a big screen: I just fit a lot of
smaller windows in it.  I'd like to have a literal wall screen,
especially if I'm in an interior, windowless (as in physical glass
windows) room, so that part of the wall could be a "window"
showing a view "outside" (real time, or the ocean, or whatever)
and other parts of the wall could be the text I'm working on/with,
etc.

(But I'll make do with these 27" 4k displays. :-) )
