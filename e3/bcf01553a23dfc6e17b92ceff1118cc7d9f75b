That sounds like the Teletype model 33, and probably other Teletypes.

If you don't give it the extra .1 second of the LF, the first printed 
character will overstrike in the middle of the line you just typed.  And 
it will be "bold" because the print head is moving very fast to the left.

Normally you'd want the LF to advance, but if you're trying to underline 
by overstriking an underline character, you'd need to pad with a NUL.

The first model 33s I used didn't have an underline.  That character was 
a leftward pointing arrow, which I think was intended to visually show 
backspace, and some systems (GE BASIC, IIRC) used it as an erase 
character.  (Of course, there was no ability to backspace on a 33.)   
The caret printed as an upward pointing arrow, hence it's often called 
"up arrow".
