So you're taking on the guy who won the Unix wars, has stayed in charge for
a couple of decades, created the OS that runs on 498 of 500 super computers,
the OS that runs on more phones than apple's phones, tablets, and computers
combined?

I've worked with Linus, I know him pretty well.  I stand by my description
above and nothing you've said has changed (and isn't likely to).

As for interfaces, huh.  I've got two decades of supporting a commercial
product that uses file system, networking, VM interfaces and I can't
remember a time were we had to change something because Linux broke
an API.
