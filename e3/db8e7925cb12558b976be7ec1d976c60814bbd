Yeeha, I actually understood your answer :). I didn't know that the 
delete key served a purpose, interrupt, which is good to know. The code 
works, but it's odd without the backing up and erasing, I may just stick 
with # and @.

Great answer, didn't even cross my mind, but of course a # at the start 
of a line is ignored, the backslash is obvious in retrospect too.

I'll go with easier :).

Thanks!
