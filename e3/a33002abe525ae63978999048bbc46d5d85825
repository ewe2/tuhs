More specifically, the issue is data space. Using overlays, you can
have a process with more than 64Kbytes of instruction space on a PDP-11,
but the maximum data space that a process can have is 64Kbytes.

The kernel is in a similar situation, but with some PDP-11 models
there is kernel mode and supervisor mode, giving you two separate
64Kbytes instruction + 64Kbytes data address spaces (and overlays
to increase the I space).

I can't see Linux fitting into 128K of data space, and GCC is definitely
out of the question. Besides, 2.11BSD already looks pretty close to 4BSD :-)
