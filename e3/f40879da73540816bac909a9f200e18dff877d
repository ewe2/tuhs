Several v0 manpages say 11/3/70

See
https://github.com/DoctorWkt/pdp7-unix/commit/14a2a9b10bd4f9c56217234afb321cd5e8509d72#diff-77750bb85687a23c2469f0679ad2c24b
The commit message says
"I've borrowed the V1 manuals from
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V1/man/man1
and changed them to reflect the PDP-7 utilities."

Where did that 1970 date come from?  Was it just made up? (Notice it is 
one year earlier, same day.) Maybe v0 didn't have any manuals? This was 
just an exercise in learning PDP7-Unix better? I understand they weren't 
in roff anyways.

Also ... what is the earliest known date where we have some 
scanned/printed document?

https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/McIlroy_v0/
says "runs on the PDP-7 and -9 computers; a more
modern version, a few months old, uses the PDP-11."
but no specific date.

The earliest date I see is from the 1stEdman / Dennis_v1 docs of 
November 3, 1971.  That is a full set of docs. There must be something 
prior to that date.

Anyone know of some early printed memo or other correspondence that 
mentions the work?

Thanks,

  Jeremy C. Reed
