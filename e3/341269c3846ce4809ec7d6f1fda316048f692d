We have a similar scheme which has been running (with minor changes) for
about 40 years, with a throughput of about 250,000 people in the last 20
years (the era of bulk user registration). A while back I wrote a note
about some of the reasons it works well, but I didn't mention that if
someone ends up with an unfortunate username, we can (modulo language
barriers) blame the parents...

We also allocate unique permanent Unix UIDs for everyone. This numbering
started in 1982, and with some foresight my (mostly retired) colleagues
decided to start numbering at 100, to allow space for system IDs.
Unfortunately nowadays a few of my older colleagues have UIDs that clash
with preallocated system UIDs on some recent Linux distributions.

Tony.
