I needed an FTP server some time back to support only *non*-anonymous
logins, where the logins had nothing to do with the underlying system.
I came up with this:

<http://ccil.org/~cowan/publish-ftpd>

I was going to add HTTP support with basic auth, but never got around
to it.

But it won't be owned by the original owner, which means any setuid bit
will give it the permissions of the copy-maker.
