Well, seeing as though Paul referred to me (see below), I'll throw my
own $0.02 in. I'd recommend V7 for several reasons:

	- it's more portable
	- the flavour of C used is more modern
	- it's got more useful applications (yacc etc.)
	- you get the stdio library
	- one last thing, there were some awful race conditions and
	  bogosities in V6 that just had to be fixed. See the
	  `50 bugs' tape, and also Dennis' own admission about

You could port that in a short amount of time, and treat it as a
warming-up exercise!

I think the list needs some traffic :-) It might be worth setting up
a list for the e-mails between co-developers, but also to have periodic
status reports and questions sent to this list.

Why do you think I set this list up in the first place ;-) ??!
