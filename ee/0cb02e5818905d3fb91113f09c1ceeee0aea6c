It's what Clem said.  You should acclimate yourself to your environment.
Pushing info into man environment is a lot like being an immigrant and
wanting to bring your laws into your new homeland.  That isn't a thing
and shouldn't be a thing.  Doesn't matter that people think ITS is better,
they are in Unix.  If you think ITS is better, go live there.

When in Rome....
