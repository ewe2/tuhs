Subject: [TUHS] BSD/386 and its ilk
Message-ID: <200807051828.52614.wes.parish@paradise.net.nz>

Hi.

I'm reading TCP/IP Illustrated - for the first time; talk about slack! - and 
noticed Stevens used BSD/386.  I remember seeing in DDJ in the early '90s ads 
for various software-plus-source from a Texas repackaging company, and they 
had BSD/[386|i|OS] at various times for $1k.00.

That was then - this is now.  Is it likely, or even possible, that BSDi the 
company would be ready to consider BSD/386 and such early releases, legacy 
that could be donated to TUHS?  And if so, who should we contact, to ask?

Thanks

Wesley Parish
