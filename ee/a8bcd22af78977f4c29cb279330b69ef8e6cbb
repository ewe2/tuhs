Yes, correct - I don't want to bring the list too off-topic, but Unisys (UNI=
VAC + Burroughs) still maintains those two platforms (OS 2000 from the UNIVA=
C line and MCP from Burroughs), and they have a hobbyist program for both sy=
stems.

s/clearpath-os-2200-software/clearpath-os-2200-express

and

https://www.unisys.com/offerings/clearpath-forward/clearpath-forward-product=
s/clearpath-mcp-software/clearpath-mcp-express

Unisys has also released older versions of MCP (1970s) as well with less res=
trictive licensing, and the community has built an emulator capable of runni=
ng them on an emulated B5500 system - http://www.phkimpel.us/B5500/

The Burroughs MCP name supposedly inspired the MCP villain in TRON as well.=20=


I've never used Burroughs Algol nor Honeywell Algol, but I am aware you can u=
se Honeywell Algol on Multics via gcos_tss (the GCOS Time Sharing Simulator)=
.
