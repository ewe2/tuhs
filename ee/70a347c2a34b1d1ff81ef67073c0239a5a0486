with the last versions, its missing a lot (i.e. I'm the person that

was also the mail for CS-NET/PhoneNET, when BBN picked it up.=E2=80=8B

=E2=80=8BMail-11 is DEC's mail standard. And is mostly a protocol spec.

PMDF was a pseudo open source rewrite of MMDF (from on the mid western
universities I believe), that got taken closed and I never knew all of the
politics.  Larry M correct me here, he might know some of it, as I'm
thinking PMDF came out of Wisconsin originally.  Whoever wrote it, took the
CS-Net C MMDF implementation and rewrote it into Pascal for VMS - this was
during the height the C vs Pascal war in CS Depts and also the time of the
UNIX vs VMS wars.=E2=80=8B     The DEC Pascal Compiler was very good and wa=
s an
excellent teaching compiler.   Paul W might remember the ordering of the
releases from the compiler group, but I think VMS Pascal was released
before VAX-11C -- which I think played into the MMDF/PMDF thing.   As I
recall, VMS Pascal definitely was bundled in the University package and was
'cheaper' if you were willing to run VMS instead of Unix at your
University.       Anyway, the folks that did PMDF formed a small firm and
sold it for a while.   There was a commercial IP implementation from France
call TUV for VMS and IIRC, the TUV folks bought PMDF and whole thing got
sold to a lot people and had quite a ride .

=E2=80=8BThat would sound more like it.   Also left and right hands not tal=
