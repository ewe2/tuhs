I'm curious what Rob and others think of the Linux /proc.  It's string 
based and it seems like it is more like /whatever_you_might_want.

The AT&T /proc that Faulkner worked on was much more narrow in scope,
in keeping with the Unix tradition.  The linux /proc was both a way
to dig into kernel stuff and control kernel stuff, it was way broader.
