Yeah, that makes sense.  Without -n, the .data segment starts right at
the top of .text, but you can't do that if you are going to share
.text but not .data.  So it's painless to round up the size of .text
so that .data starts at a memory protection boundary.

Historians aren't constantly confronted with people who carry on
self-confidently about the rule against adultery in the sixth amendment to
the Declamation of Independence, as written by Benjamin Hamilton. Computer
scientists aren't always having to correct people who make bold assertions
about the value of Objectivist Programming, as examplified in the HCNL
entities stored in Relaxational Databases.  --Mark Liberman
