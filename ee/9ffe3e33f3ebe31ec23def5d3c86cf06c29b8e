You don't even have to install a godoc server unless you want
a web interface. You can just type for example

go doc regexp			-- get top level regexp documentation
go doc regexp/syntax		-- regexp syntax
go doc regexp.MustCompile	-- help on just one exported function
go doc regexp.Regexp		-- help on exported type Regexp and a list of its methods

Often this is quite handy. I just open 6 to 8 windows in acme &
can have help text for various things, all accessible at once.
In contrast browsers feel quite clunky. They waste a lot of white
space and yet you have to scroll even on a HDMI+ rez display!
