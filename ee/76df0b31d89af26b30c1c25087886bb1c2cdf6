I'm coming into this late (and tired, been working on my water system
and the carbs on my boat all day) but I *loved* the single namespace
for all structure fields.

Instead of 

	p->size

we have

	p->st_size

and I instantly know that p is a struct stat pointer.  

I get that it doesn't scale but man, oh man, do I love the early Unix
data structures that had one namespace.  I kinda wish you hadn't fixed
that Steve.

What was the push that made you fix it?
