Subject: [TUHS] A decision
Message-ID: <20170405222255.GA4109@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, in the 25 years of running this list, generally things have gone
well and I've not had to make many unilateral decisions. But today I
have chosen to unsubscribe Joerg Schilling from the list.

I'm sending this e-mail in so that there is a level of transparency here.
I've sent Joerg an e-mail outlining my reasons.

Cheers, Warren
