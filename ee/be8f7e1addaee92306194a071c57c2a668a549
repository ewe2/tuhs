I don't think so.  I ended up springing for the compiler when I purchased
my Ultra-60.  But, it was extraordinarily clunky and unreliable because of
their licensing scheme.  It commonly refused to work thinking that there
were too many instances runnining or something like that.  It was a big
relief when the GNU compiler because available and I never touched the Sun
compiler again.
