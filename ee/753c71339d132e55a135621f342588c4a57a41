This almost exactly mirrors my experience, except we moved off the VAX
before the 8600. (And I did my PDP-11 assembly programming on the DEC
PRO-350, DEC's PDP-11-based "personal computer.")

I came from TOPS-20, and I agree that the hardest part was learning the
command names and different behaviors. I read the manuals, a couple of
books (including, ironically as it turned out, Steve Bourne's), a bunch
of various source code, and a lot of unix-wizards discussions.
