That's still the case with modern-day sh(1).

explains that a simple command doesn't need to result in a command name
to execute.  In your first pipeline, there's nothing to copy the data
from the first subshell's stdin redirected from ./word to the subshell's
stdout that's pipes into sed's stdin.  Adding a command to do the copy
works.

    <word cat | sed 20q
