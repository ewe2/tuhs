You might get a better answer by asking on comp.lang.lisp, but my
guesses are that mc500_2_0 is a Masscomp 500 (?) running RTU 2.0.
Dual seem to have been people who made early 68k boards and machines
and (according to
http://www.clock.org/~fair/computers/dual-systems.html) were Unisoft's
first customer.  Didn't Sun use unisoft as well, before the BSD ports
(so sometime pre SunOS 1 I guess...).

All of these, look like early 68k Unix machines - there must
have been hundreds of kinds of these, I guess.
