People working on emulators run into these issues all the time as well.
There was a greater diversity of object formats when Unix was younger
as well, most have been displaced by ELF (PECOFF being the only exception
that's still around outside of Windows).

Also people that try to decompile things back into .o files run into these
issues as well... There's been efforts over the years to extract different
kinds
of drivers from old binary-only kernels, for example, that have met with
differing
degrees of success. Though putting the relocation info back in after the
fact can be quite tricky... The successful ones I know of disassembled and
reassembled to cope with this issue after some post-processing phase to
cope with places where there were tables...
