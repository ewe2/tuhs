While it isn't identical, you might find the user guide for the original 
M8063 Falcon SBC 11/21
to be at least somewhat useful. It can be found at:

As far as I can remember the Falcon and Falcon+ are functionally very 
similar with the Falcon+
supporting larger memory devices and having a more flexible set of 
options for the memory map.

Chapter 6 of the 1985 edition of the Microcomputer Products Handbook 
lists all of the configuration
options for the Falcon+ and also shows the DC331 at E20 as being a "gate 
array". I have a copy
of this manual and could send you a copy of the relevant pages if that 
would be helpful.
