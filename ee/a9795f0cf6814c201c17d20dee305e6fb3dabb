VAX/VMS version 1 (1978) had email, capable of sending messages either
locally or over a DECnet network.  In keeping with standard DECnet
syntax, it used "::" instead of "@".  Len Kawell was the author of VMS
mail.  He got the idea, and copied the UI, from the University of
Illinois PLATO CAI system, which had email capability.  I don't know
if PLATO's email was capable of transmitting messages between computer
systems; Tomlinson may have been the first to do that.

But the concept of email goes way back.
