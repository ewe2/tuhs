No worries, I already did -- but I also sent it back to the pubs' folks at
USENIX.  They have slowing scanning the print archives on an as-needed
basis; which is where it belongs.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes one thing leads to another.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Following the recent mention of some retro-brew 68K sing=
le board<br>
&gt; &gt; systems, I decided to build a CB030 board (in progress). I figure=
 it is a<br>
&gt; &gt; rough proxy for a 1980 VAX and would allow for some experimentati=
on with<br>
&gt; &gt; the 32V / SysIII / 8th edition code.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; My first thought was to use the M68K compiler that is in=
cluded with the<br>
&gt; &gt; Blit sources (see THUS Archive for this), as I had used that befo=
re to<br>
&gt; &gt; explore some of the Blit source. That compiler is LP32, not ILP32=
 - which<br>
&gt; &gt; may be a source of trouble. Just changing the SZINT parameter yie=
lded some<br>
&gt; &gt; issues, so I started looking at the PCC source.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; This source does not have a =E2=80=9Ctable.c=E2=80=9D in=
 the well known format as<br>
&gt; &gt; described in the =E2=80=9CA tour of the portable C compiler=E2=80=
=9D paper. Instead it uses<br>
&gt; &gt; a file =E2=80=9Cstin=E2=80=9D which appears to be in a more compa=
ct format and is<br>
&gt; &gt; translated into a =E2=80=9Ctable.c=E2=80=9D file by a new pre-pro=
cessor (&quot;sty.y=E2=80=9D). Then<br>
&gt; &gt; looking at the VAX compilers for 8th and 10th edition, these too =
use this<br>
&gt; &gt; =E2=80=9Cstin=E2=80=9D file.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; All the other m68K compilers (based on pcc) that I found=
 appear to<br>
&gt; &gt; derive from the V7/32V/SysIII lineage, not from the 8th edition l=
ineage.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; A quick google did not yield much background or document=
ation on the<br>
&gt; &gt; STY format.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Anybody on this list that can shed some light on the his=
tory of the STY<br>
&gt; &gt; table and on how to use it? Any surviving reports or memos that w=
ould be<br>
&gt; &gt; useful?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Many thanks in advance<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
