All done in troff I believe.  Though not for long, I think they switched 
to framemaker around then.

Whoops, I'm wrong, I looked, that's clearly framemaker.  Sigh.  I love me
some troff, even to this day.  I really really really wish that someone 
had done framemaker, word, whatever, that was the GUI interface that had
troff under the covers.  Why?  Because you can version control the source
and diffs will actually make sense.  Best of luck doing that with any
GUI editor.
