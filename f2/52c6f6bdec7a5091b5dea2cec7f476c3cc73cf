If you're interviewing a new hire, see how long it takes 'em to work out 
what this does:

     :; </etc/motd> /dev/tty sed 1q ;: echo "Hello, world"

Tested on all shells at my disposal; might even work on V7.  Did I mention 
that I use Perl, and used to use APL\360?  The only reason I don't write 
obfuscated code is that I might be the one who has to maintain it later...
