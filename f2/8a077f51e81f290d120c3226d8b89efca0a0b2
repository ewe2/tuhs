Linus attacks anyone who he thinks is misguided.  He's been wrong but
he's usually right.

Yeah, uh huh.  If it makes you feel better to say stuff like that, go
for it.  You do realize it doesn't reflect well on you, right?  The
guy is a pretty darn good kernel engineer, I think he knows what a 
kernel/userspace interface is.  It's a big part of the job description.

Was running Linux well before that, I ran it when you booted off of
floppies and there was no networking.  I don't know when I started but
this was in 1993:

and I'm sure I'd been running it for quite a while by that time.
