Thanks, will try bochs. Seems to be able to handle MFM and Protected-Mode (In Intel 286).

PCem was not that successful. Got double-panic right after kernel initialisation. Virtualbox was able to Boot kernel and run forward into install routine, but then stalled at first attempt of accessing the emulated HDD

KR,
Andreas
