What is being provided is a generic layering system on top of stdio.
Any sort of conversion you want.  Encryption, CRC, XOR block, compression
(we support gzip and lz4).  Those are just the layers we use right now,
it's easy to imagine others being added.

The point is that there is no one API that is going to pleasantly encode
all of the options to all of those layers and any that may come later.
Are you seriously suggesting that you want to read the freopen(3)
man page and see all of these options explained?  That's the classic
open source way, dump everything in one poorly thought out man page.
It's not the Unix way, people think about it harder.

For the record, I pushed for the single string encoding as well but got
pushed off it as I realized the API wasn't as simple as I imagined.
While you could do it that way you shouldn't do it that way, it's just
not a good API.

I'm very pleased with how it turned out in our code, other than a handful
of fpush() calls, it just looks like stock stdio.
