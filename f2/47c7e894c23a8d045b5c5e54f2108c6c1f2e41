John (Johnny to his English-speaking friends) von Neumann was a
colossal figure in 20th Century mathematics and physics with a
photographic memory, an ability to work on several jobs at once, a
passion for partying, and a broad range of research publication in
computer science, economics, game theory, mathematics, probability,
and physics.

There are several books about him that I've found enjoyable reading.
He is included with all of the other major quantum pioneers in the
BibNet Project bibliography archive at

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/bibnet/authors/v/von-neumann-john.bib

[change .bib to .html for a similar view in a Web browser, but with
live hyperlinks].

Those bibliographies strive to offer complete coverage of all known
publications by their subject scientists, as well as coverage of
publications about them, and their works.

Reports of bibliographic omissions are always welcome, and updates
will be made in short order.  In the case of von Neumann, there are
likely numerous still-classified reports of his work in the Manhattan
Project, the post-WW-II effort to build the hydrogen bomb, and his
consulting with numerous government and military agencies, that remain
unknown and unavailable.  [In the case of Alan Turing, some of his
classified war-time work has finally been released to the public, and
every such known instance has been included in his bibliography.]
