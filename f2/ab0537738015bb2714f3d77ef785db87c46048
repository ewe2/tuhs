An excerpt from The Jargon File:

Some people are confused over whether this word is appropriately =E2=80=98U=
NIX=E2=80=99 or
=E2=80=98Unix=E2=80=99; both forms are common, and used interchangeably. De=
nnis Ritchie
says that the =E2=80=98UNIX=E2=80=99 spelling originally happened in CACM's=
 1974 paper The
UNIX Time-Sharing System because =E2=80=9Cwe had a new typesetter and troff=
 had
just been invented and we were intoxicated by being able to produce small
caps.=E2=80=9D Later, dmr tried to get the spelling changed to =E2=80=98Uni=
x=E2=80=99 in a couple
of Bell Labs papers, on the grounds that the word is not acronymic. He
failed, and eventually (his words) =E2=80=9Cwimped out=E2=80=9D on the issu=
e. So, while the
trademark today is =E2=80=98UNIX=E2=80=99, both capitalizations are grounde=
d in ancient
usage; the Jargon File uses =E2=80=98Unix=E2=80=99 in deference to dmr's wi=
shes.
