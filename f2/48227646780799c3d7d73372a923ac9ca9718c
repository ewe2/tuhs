It depends. If the content is not damaged then you can probably "wipe" them.
I mean, look at the printed side: if there are scratches there chances are 
the data is damaged as well and you may be out of luck (depends on whether it
affects the catalog).

However, if the printed surface is not terribly damaged, and the problem is 
that the mirror-looking side is scratched then your data may be healthy and 
it is surface irregularity that distorts the laser. There are kits out there
that can wipe the surface and render it again smooth. I used one such kit 
several years ago with good results. Casually, it's on the shelf in front
of my eyes now.. lemme see... It says

	CURTIS disk restore. Radial scratch repair and cleaning system for
CD/DVD discs. www.curtis.com

According to the box it will not repair gauges, deep scratches, label-side
damaging or warping.
