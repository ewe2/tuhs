Both are not aligned with my experiences. 

Note that I replaced Linux from the central web server for berlios.de 
by Solaris around 2005 and that resulted in a noticeable increased overall 
performance which includes fast processes.

I contacted a friend and we are going to set up such a machine and do tests.
This however will take a few weeks.

BTW: I am not using "tar" for my tests but rather "star" as "tar" is too 
unspecific to be used for comparisons and as known implementations (including 
"gtar") are too slow to use them for performance metering.

Since SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA is available, "star -copy ..." is e.g. at least 10% 
faster than any other copying tool, including ufsdump/ufsrestore.
