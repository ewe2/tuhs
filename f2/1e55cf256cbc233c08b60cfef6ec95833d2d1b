When 0 is coerced implicitly or explicitly to a pointer type, it becomes a
null pointer.  That's true even on architectures where all-bits-zero is
*not* a null pointer.  However, in contexts where there is no expected
type, as in a call to execl(), the null at the end of the args list has to
be explicitly cast to (char *)0 or some other null pointer.

As for the definition of NULL, it is indeed 0 on Linux, but can also be
defined as ((void *)0), as on FreeBSD and the Mac, or even as 0L on systems
where ints are half-size and pointers and longs are full-size.
