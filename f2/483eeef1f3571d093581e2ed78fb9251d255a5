When I was in high school, I loved reading about instruction sets. I 
recommend the first five volumes of Annual Review in Automatic 
Programming, if you are interested.

The DEC instructions sets were all quite elegant, from the minimal PDP-8 
(nee PDP-5) 12-bit machine to the PDP-10 (nee 6). I maintained the BCPL 
compiler at BBN for a while in the 1970's, and it was a pleasure to 
figure out what machine code to generate.

Then there was RISC vs CISC, where the VAX was a major punching bag. I 
was at Berkeley for RISC-I, and was a part of the small student group 
that did its register windows scheme.
