This thread needs to move to COFF to continue - although my own story is
1/2 about BSD and the VAX.

I had to chuckle when I read that.  In the fall of '82 (I think), we got a
Smalltalk VM from PARC at UCB.  Dave Unger, Ken Keller, and I - plus some
other folks in Patterson's systems seminar who's names I have since
forgotten, wrote a VM in C for the VAX/BSD.  We used an AED512 and Keller's
graphics library from his thesis running over a 19.2 serial link as the
output.  About a month after we had it running, a couple of us got to visit
PARC, and Peter Deutch showed us Smalltalk running on a Dorado.  He ran his
hand with the mouse across the screen opening and closing a bunch of
windows randomly.   We started laughing and Peter asked us what was so
funny.  We told him what he did would have taken at least 5 minutes to
redisplay on BSD/VAX version.
