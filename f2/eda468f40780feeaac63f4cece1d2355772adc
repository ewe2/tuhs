Subject: [TUHS] Old DEC books for sale
Message-ID: <20121012042549.GA30357@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, as I have to move office at the end of the year, I have a few old
DEC books which I'd like to re-home to good families. I am happy to give
them away, but I would like to be reimbursed for postage and packing.

I've put up the details of the books at this link:

Feel free to pass this on to anybody else who might be interested.

Cheers,
	Warren
