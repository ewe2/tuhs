I think that links to the talks will be there, but they will be uploaded to
youtube. Most conferences give some instructions to speakers for uploading
talk related materials, but I've not seen anything from EuroBSDcon. Most
likely it is in a spam folder :(

I hope it will be there as well. I quite enjoyed giving the talk, though
the audience was small.

I would love to find that as well... At least one person came up to me
after the talk and told me about a set of Onyx Z8000 System III manuals he
had that we're making arrangements to find a good home (like maybe mine).
Future versions of this talk will likely include a plea for people to
contact me with historic artifacts so I might be able to copy them...
