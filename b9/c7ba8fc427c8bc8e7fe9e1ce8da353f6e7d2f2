You should live in rural Scotland Sir.

Broadband is NEX in places - for example where I live.  512K download 
(max) more normally 380K!  Forget FTTC or FTTP - I have CTTM - tandard 
old-fashioned Copper to the Modem.

I still need to use a 19.2K modem when the going gets tough.

If you want to try an AA modem number I can send you it - but it is 
Scottish (UK) based.

If you contact me off-list I can try tomorrow.

Iain
