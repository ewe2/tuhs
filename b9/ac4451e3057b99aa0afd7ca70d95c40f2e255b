Just a note... back in my old DEC days I went around and installed a
thing called the ML11-A (IIRC).
It was a Massbus box of MK11/MS750 memory arrays interfaced to a disk
emulation controller.

Plug it on your Massbus, format the memory with the disk formatter and
you have something like
an RS04 swap device made out of memory with no rotation delay.  Consider
it an early SSD.

It used plain old PDP/VAX memory (and could format and bad block out ECC
errors so the memory
didn't have to be perfect) and was software compatible (I think) with
the RS04...

I installed one at the AT&T/NY Bell site next door to the World Trade
Center back in 84-85 or so.

I wonder if it was still running on 9/11.  Word was Unix really was
improved on the 11/70 boxes without a huge investment on new gear. 
Quick swap was a big help on heavily loaded boxes.

Loved seeing the diag run tests and light the fault light on the box of
memory.  Also had a write protect like every good drive should.
