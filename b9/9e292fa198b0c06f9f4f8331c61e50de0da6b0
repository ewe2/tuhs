All, I'm looking for images of the cat device as mentioned several
times in the 7th edition manual, see e.g. TROFF(1)and CAT(4).

From what I gathered during my digs is that it should look like a
GSI 8400, but that didn't help. Anyone here who can help me find out
what these machines looked like? A picture would be the best, but
information on what to look for in images of unnamed typesetters will
do as well.
