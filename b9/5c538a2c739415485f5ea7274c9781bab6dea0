The "learn" about shell or editing required you to demonstrate you
could type with 'pack my box with six dozen liquor jugs' input gating
the lesson as I remember it. something else around that time, I think
the TOPS-10 typing tutor got me the home keys. Took another 10 years
for me to wake up to being able to type mostly eyes off the keyboard
but it sure seems to work (most of the the time) now.
