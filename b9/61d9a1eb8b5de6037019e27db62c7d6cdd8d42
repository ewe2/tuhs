Yes please!  I long for the days when it was possible to understand the 
entire kernel source...

The P2 bus is designated as "private" i.e. do whatever you want with it 
with your proprietary hardware.  I don't think the "standard" CPU board 
even looks at it.

Have you tried speeds other than 9600?  They look to me like framing 
errors.
