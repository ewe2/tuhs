Sorry my analogy didn't work.  Look at a photomicrograph of a chip; at least
to me it's pretty obvious where the random logic is located.

Here's another try.  In a microcoded machine, the same hardware is used for
every microinstruction.  In random logic, custom designed circuitry is used
for each special case.
