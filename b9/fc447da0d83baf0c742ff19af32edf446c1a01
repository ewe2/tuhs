Truth is I think IBM beat Sun on getting loadable modules for the kernel out=
 first.  But I was counting the versions that people really looked at which i=
s why I give Linux credit.  =20

It makes sense they modeled on SunOS btw but the fact is the Linux version i=
s what folks like *BSD and macOS modeled after later. =20

Btw you are 100% right - As for launchd I agree/no doubt -  but I=E2=80=99d a=
lready given up on MacOS being able to be admin=E2=80=99ed like a Unix box. =
 I can pretty much use it via iterm2 as a user like one and if mostly works a=
s I expect (which I do appreciate). =20

Linux is seductive enough to make think I should be able to admin it like I h=
ave for the last 40 years and it then bites me when I least expect it.  =20

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.=
