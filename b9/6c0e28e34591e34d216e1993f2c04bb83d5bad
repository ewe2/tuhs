I remember spending really a long time finding and building BSD/GNU versions of utilities which actually had the options you needed on early SunOS 5 machines: later on Sun themselves put some of them back.

As someone who was at Sun, loved SunOS 4 and hated Solaris, yup.  Even the
diehard Solaris people like Bryan Cantrill say that they stick /opt/gnu/bin
in their path first.

It boggles my mind that Sun was so strict on being compat with SVR4 and
they knew that everyone hated that.
