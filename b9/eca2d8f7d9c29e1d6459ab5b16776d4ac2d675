Could you tell me which year/month this was? Perhaps it's in the ACM
digital library and I can find it that way.

Thanx!

The URL is http://www.acm.org/classics/sep95/ so I suppose it is September
1995.

The original publication of the Ken and Dennis Turing Award lectures
was in August 1984 CACM.  I gather there may have been some sort of
repeat a few years ago, but my CACM collection, like my UNIX collection,
is on the ancient side, so I don't know about that.

If you check the first line on that web page, you'll notice that it says:
"Reprinted from Communication of the ACM, Vol. 27, No. 8, August 1984, pp.
761-763. Copyright � 1984, Association for Computing Machinery, Inc."


So I'll guess the original print date was August 8 1984.

Well, I think the whole basis for Richard Stallman's formation of the FSF
and the GNU project during the 1980's was to keep alive the inherently
"Open Source" nature of the software created during preceding decades.

I hope not many people actually believe that Open Source is new concept.
My personal take on Stallman is that he's a little whacked, but I do
respect him incredibly for the work he's done with through the FSF.  I
think the industry could very easily have gone the Shareware route of the
PC world had the GNU project, and eventually Linux, not entered the scene.

It's possible we'd still have been okay with Linux once FreeBSD and
NetBSD became a reality, but I believe Linux's early appearance struck
just at exactly the right moment -- just when the web was being born.

There's an immense amount of work ahead, but at least we're maintaining
our history... and hopefully some people are learning from it.
