Just to add that (Gast)"Wirt"h is an innkeeper, and on the
Nikolaus-Day children place shoes in front of their doors so that
Nikolaus can put something in (chocolade!, for example).
But if you would speak "e" just like "ea" than "Wert"h would
surely be "Worth" it, too.

I want to affiliate to the colony of thankful who appreciate your
messages.  Unfortunately i started collecting them just a few
months ago and thus missed quite a lot of them.
