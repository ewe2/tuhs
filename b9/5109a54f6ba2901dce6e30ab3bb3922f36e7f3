Now, that You know where the name unix comes from(see my previous post),
there still is a *funny* coincidence in pronounciation of both words.

In Oxford American Dictionary

eunuch is pronounced as "yoo-nuk" (not all symbols reproduced)
unit is "yoo-nit"
unique is "yoo-neek"

In Webster English Language Dictionary

eunuch is "'yunek"
unit is "'yunet"
unique is "yu'nek,yu'nik"

You can notice, that unix , more similar to unit or unique will be 
pronounced differently(?).

It suggests , that although for us foreigners the difference is hard to 
be distinguished, but perhaps Americans and Englishmen can hear the 
subtle difference above shown in the pronounciation(or perhaps not all). 
I suspect , that if the pronounciation were be same many people would 
have noticed it before.

It is clear , that opinion of American/English linguistic/language 
specialist would be neccesarry.
