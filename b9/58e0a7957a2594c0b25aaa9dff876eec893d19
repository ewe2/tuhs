I take issue with this, and have experience to backup my view: it is not =
hard to change Internet Service Providers (ISP) for large corporations - =
I did it several times during my tenure as the =E2=80=9CInternet guy=E2=80=
=9D for Apple Computer, Inc., an ~$8bn revenue multinational =
corporation. You just have to plan for it properly, handle transitions =
gracefully (ideally, with overlap), and keep control of (do not =
outsource) key assets like domain names, public IP network address =
assignments, and services like e-mail (SMTP).

Apple's primary =E2=80=9Cface=E2=80=9D to the world in July 1988 when I =
arrived was a DEC VAX-11/780 running 4.3 BSD Unix. I renumbered it once, =
when we changed from CSNET=E2=80=99s X25NET (9.6Kb/s IP-over-X.25 via =
TELENET/SPRINTlink) to a 56Kb/s (DS0) leased line - we started using an =
assigned class B network: 130.43/16 - the VAX became 130.43.2.2. It =
retained its name as =E2=80=9Capple.com=E2=80=9D until it was =
decommissioned in the late 1990s.

Apple was on CSNET primarily (where the VAX was connected), and had a =
separated BARRNET T1 that belonged to the A/UX group (A/UX was Apple=E2=80=
=99s version of Unix). I connected our two external =E2=80=9Cperimeter=E2=80=
=9D networks , set up fail-over IP routing (initially with RIP (ugh), =
later deployed BGP), upgraded CSNET in California, added a second site =
in Cambridge, MA to CSNET, later moved Cambridge to NEARNET, replaced =
CSNET in California with CERFNET, helped our European offices in Zeist, =
NL connect to SURFnet, and our customer service division in Austin, TX =
to SPRINTNET (they had to forcibly (disruptively) renumber, but they =
screwed up by not listening to me during their network planning).

We did have to clean up an internal IP address mess when I got there: =
lots of =E2=80=9Cpicked out of the air=E2=80=9D net numbers in use: =
90/8, 92/8, 95/8, etc.; those were all renumbered into properly assigned =
net 17/8, which Apple still uses today.

Before the WWW, =E2=80=9Cftp.apple.com=E2=80=9D offered up MacOS =
software distribution via anonymous FTP from a Mac IIcx running A/UX =
under my desk, and to prevent our connectivity from being overwhelmed =
when MacOS releases were published, I wrote an ftp-listener to restrict =
the number of FTP connections per peer classful network number for that =
server. I later installed that code at the Smithsonian Institution on a =
Unix machine they set up for public anonymous FTP of their =
digitally-scanned historical photography archive, because they had the =
same problem: limited connectivity, popular content.

As for mergers, acquisitions, and spinoffs, I was involved in networking =
for Coral Software (acquired; purveyors of Macintosh Common Lisp) which =
became Apple Cambridge; Taligent which was an Apple/IBM joint venture =
(an Apple OS & software group spin-out; they were set up with a separate =
public class B network number and domain name from the get-go to provide =
for maximum future flexibility, even though they were initially in a =
building on the Apple Campus in Cupertino, CA and thus on the dark fiber =
plant, and Apple (me) was their ISP) and ultimately IBM bought out =
Apple; The Apple Engineering secured connection to the =E2=80=9CSomerset =
Design Center=E2=80=9D in Austin, TX (a joint venture between Apple, =
IBM, and Motorola (the AIM alliance) from whence the PowerPC processor =
came), which was tricky.

I=E2=80=99ll grant that when I was doing this work, Internet =
connectivity downtime didn=E2=80=99t mean immediate revenues losses =
(e.g., from not being able to accept orders in the Apple Online store, =
which did not (yet) exist), but e-mail was critical to Apple=E2=80=99s =
world-wide operations, and making e-mail robust & reliable was the first =
job I was hired to do: fix sendmail(8), take control of DNS (CSNET =
controlled the apple.com zone file when I arrived), and naturally, that =
extended to making Internet connectivity & routing robust as well.

The main problem that =E2=80=9Cmodern=E2=80=9D mergers & acquisitions =
face in coordinating networking is a direct result of something else I =
fought against in the IETF: private IP address space (RFC 1918), and =
Network Address Translation (NAT) - see RFC 1627. Unfortunately, I and =
my colleagues lost that debate, which is why one now sees double/triple =
NAT setups to try and make overlapping private IPv4 addressed networks =
talk to each other. You=E2=80=99ll notice that I eschewed use of private =
address space while at Apple, and having unique public IP address space =
made most things simpler - funny how following the architecture works =
better than fighting it.

Unix is tied into all of this because it has been the platform where =
(most often) the first implementation of many of these protocols or =
hacks is written. It takes a flexible operating system to make such a =
wide range of applications possible. However, properly setting up the =
rest of the communications infrastructure (in which Unix must =
communicate) is important too.
