Well, you could look at "Votrax" on Wikipedia.  Allegedly, the first
words spoken by a Unix system at Bell Labs, using its Votrax
synthesizer, were "file not found".

Things that are now known as "sound cards" were called A:D and D:A
converters back in those days.  And there were a fair variety of them
available for both Unibus and Qbus systems.

The vacuum-tube circuits may be running from 350 VDC but somewhere
there are low-level inputs from which everything is amplified.  Think
microphone.
