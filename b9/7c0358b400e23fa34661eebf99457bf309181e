Close. "Boogie Down Productions" is a specific group (actually a trio)
that formed in the South Bronx (I guess the term "Boogie Down" is kind
of specific to the South Bronx; I mean, it's kind of hard to image
much boogie-ing happening in Parkchester or Riverdale...). BDP's only
constant member, KRS One, was/is highly influence and considered
something of an elder in the rap community.

I'm afraid this is VERY far afield from the typical TUHS content,
though. In deference to other list members, I'm going to bow out of
the history of hip hop and NYC geography before I incur the wrath of
Warren et al. :-)
