Same set of images (and kernel) works fine under SIMH.  Mounts 4 RL's
without a problem.  It is not till I put it on the real PDP that I have
the problem.

I should also mention it is not hardware as I can shift the Unit Plugs
around and the behavior is the same.  RL0 and RL1 mount, nothing else
is visible.
