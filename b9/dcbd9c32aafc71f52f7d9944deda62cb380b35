Bell got their VAX in Feb. 1978.

London and Reiser ported Unix to it and was multi-user in April.

Then spent five months to clean up for internal release in the Fall.

UCB purchased their VAX in the Fall.

Bell sent their prototype 32/V to Berkeley.

Bell's paging work began in late 1978.

Berkeley's own work from swap to paging began in late spring of 1979.
(Joy presented about this PUNIXVAX in June 1979 UNIX Conference.)

32/V did come out a few weeks after System 7.

By mid November, the Berkeley virtual memory code was in use
and was expected to be available for others by early December.

Berkeley's "Virtual Vax/UNIX" was available for students after
Christmas (1979) break.

BSD distribution to others began in January 1980.

The Kashtan performance evaluation versus VMS (with benchmark code) was 
done very soon after. (And Joy's fixes in March.)

(I did a few interviews specifically related to this. I have long 
chapters about this and I can provide my references/citations when I get 
back from a trip I am on.)
