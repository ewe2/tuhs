No, I designed an interface that works on top of all known operating systems.

The term "perceived" does not apply.

So you believe you can create a dual layer video DVD with a layer break 
that matches the meta data in the IFO file with that driver concept?

So you believe you can write an audio CD with CD-Text that matches the indices 
on an existing CD with that driver concept?

So you believe you can read an audio CD in a way that allows you make a 
definite statement on whether all bits have been read correctly or whether 
there have been interpolated parts inside?

People who only have a hammer tend to believe that all problems are nails.

This is what you get on Plan 9...
