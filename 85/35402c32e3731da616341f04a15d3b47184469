From the tuhs web site:

"This is a set of addenda to Seventh Edition Unix, possibly put out by the
Labs."
and
"The identity of the person who donated them is unknown."

Two questions: Was this put out by the Labs?

Second: There was recently a discussion about a tape found at some public
location during an early Unix user group meeting. Is this that tape?
