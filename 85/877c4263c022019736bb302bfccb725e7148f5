A typical manpage had just the right length. Reading man pages
and experimenting is how I initially learned all about unix
commands.

Keeping a manpage short also limited what you as the
implementer would be tempted to add to the command. Manpages
work best for programs that follow the unix mantra of do one
thing and do it well. But not for kitchensink programs.  When
you need a multipage reference manual (for *experts*) with a
TOC and program to "navigate", you're much more likely to give
into the temptation of adding more features than partition
functionality into separate programs that work well together.
Not to mention it is harder to get something right that has
many more features.
