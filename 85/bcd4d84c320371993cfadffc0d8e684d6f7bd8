No offense intended, but why waste time on 386 (or even way more time on
286)?  I can't imagine that anyone has any of those machines anymore.
And if anyone is so broke that they do and can't afford a newer machine
I have piles of celeron boxes looking for a home.  300-500mhz with 64-128M
and probably a broken disk but maybe it works.  You pay shipping and they
are yours.  If you are doing interesting work and you are really broke
I'll pay shipping.

But 286?  Come on.  Let it go, it sucked.  I can almost see the point of
386 except that nobody has one.
