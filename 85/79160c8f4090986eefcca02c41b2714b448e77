Hi all,

I just discovered this list & decided to join.

In August 2008 a thread was started by 'zmkm' where
he asked (among other things) for a "unix assembler
manual" by DMR. I could post a scan on line if
somebody is still interested. It's a 12 page text
and the CPU involved is -of course- DEC PDP-11.

Plse let me know.

Regards
