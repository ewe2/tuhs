The big problem with xfig (and fig befoe that) is that it didn't utilize
what to me is one of the most important features of pic which is invisible
elements.  When I do a complicated diagram, I start with an invisible box
and hang the diagram on it.  That way, if I run out of space or need to
make other adjustments I can just change the size of that invisible box
scaffold.  Sure beats stuff done in absolute coordinates by (x)fig or even
many other modern drawing programs where everything has to be manually
moved around and scaled.
