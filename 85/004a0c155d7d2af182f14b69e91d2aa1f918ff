Subject: [TUHS] Adding an RP06 disk to a running V7 instance
Message-ID: <566344EA.7010401@gmail.com>

I have set up v7 following [1] and I would like to better understand the 
process of adding a disk to the environment. Here is what I know:

The system has one RP06 with two partitions rp0 and rp3 which correspond 
to the two block devices rp0, rp3, and the two character devices rrp0, 
and rrp3. The special files look like so:
brw-r--r-- 1 root    6,  0 Dec 31 19:05 /dev/rp0
brw-r--r-- 1 root    6,  7 Dec 31 19:04 /dev/rp3
crw-r--r-- 1 root   14,  0 Dec 31 19:01 /dev/rrp0
crw-r--r-- 1 root   14,  7 Dec 31 19:01 /dev/rrp3

This meshes with the device classes switches in c.c:

The block device switch:
struct  bdevsw  bdevsw[] =
{
...
         nulldev, nulldev, hpstrategy, &hptab,   /* hp = 6 */
...
}

The character device switch:
struct  cdevsw  cdevsw[] =
{
...
         nulldev, nulldev, hpread, hpwrite, nodev, nulldev, 0,   /* hp = 
14 */
...
}

I would like to add another RP disk to the environment. After I attach 
an RP04/05/06 to the system, what should I use as the major/minor device 
numbers? To put it differently, it doesn't seem correct to me to use 6,1 
for the block device or 14,1 for the character device on the new drive 
as it's a completely different disk from rp0 and rp3 which are just 
partitions on the first drive and have 6,0, 6,7, and 14,0, 14,7. If each 
RP can have 8 partitions and there can be 8 drives, what is the correct 
major, minor numbers to use with v7 for multiple devices?

c.c only lists one vector each for the hp device (one block vector where 
hp = 6, and one char vector where hp = 15).

Thanks,

Will
