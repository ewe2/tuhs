This is a great story, though I confess that the thought of sitting like
that sounds rather uncomfortable.

I wonder if either or both of you, Ken, and Doug, could talk a little about
the Bell Labs withdrawal from Multics from your perspectives? What was that

MAC like afterwards? I gather it was friendly; was there any collaboration
there beyond casual correspondence?
