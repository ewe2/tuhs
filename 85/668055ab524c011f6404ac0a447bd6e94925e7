Memories of IEBUPDTE come to me...  A very useful program, when it came to 
doing things, ahem, not allowed by the computer centre, by us Comp Sci 
kiddies...

Ah, the time I got SPITBOL to work beyond its use-by date, for example; 
the thing was riddled with date checks (the first one was obvious, but the 
rest not so much; its endearing habit was to jump to whatever was in R0 at 
the time).  I wrote something that searched for that particular date 
string, and after inspecting the surrounding binary code I patched it...

And who here hasn't done "cat file ... > file"?

Walking down the corridors of Comp Sci, a student in front of me dropped 
his entire deck of approx 2000 cards, all over the floor...  I have no 
idea whether he got them sorted, but I sure as hell used rubber bands 
after that!
