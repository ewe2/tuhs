In the scheme of "current" languages, Go is pretty good.  With two major 
caveats, IMO:

1) The build system.  It doesn't work with make(1).  That makes it a 
non-starter for anything other than trivial projects at $WORK.  While I 
appreciate the arguments for the apparent simplicity of the "go" command, 
that doesn't work for us.  Which would have been fine, but for the 
entirely antagonistic bent they have taken against being able to build Go 
programs with make(1).  Our build environment entirely precludes Go's 
promiscuous insistence on unfettered internet access, and hardwired 
directory paths.

2) Hardwired directory paths for the development/build environment (see 
above).

It seems they have unlearned all the UNIX lessons.  Sad, really.  I would 
love to toss out Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, et al.  And could make the 
argument for it, I think.  But the build environment will never work in 
our shop, therefore Go won't either.

And that ... sucks.
