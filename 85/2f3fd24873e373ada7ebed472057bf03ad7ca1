I am constantly bemused by the number of "setuid root" commands, when a 
simple "setgid whatever" will achieve the same task.

My mantra has always been: "If you think you need setuid root, then you 
are probably thinking wrong."

My favourite here is the "ps" command:

     On my FreeBSD server:

 	% ls -l /bin/ps
 	-r-xr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  35640 Oct 15  2017 /bin/ps

     On my crappy MacBook:

 	% ls -l /bin/ps
 	-rwsr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  51200 Jul 15  2017 /bin/ps

(I didn't check my Penguin box, because I don't think that I'll like what 
I'll see.)
