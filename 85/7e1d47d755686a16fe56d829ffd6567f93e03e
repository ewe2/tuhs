Be careful, those early multiplexer attempts by Chesson were very
buggy. I bounced off them pretty hard, and greg and I had long
debugging sessions trying to get ur-Jerq up reliably on them. The
pains were one component of dmr proposing streams* as another model.

I was using the v7 ones; the v6 ones must be even buggier.

* Or as USG later dubbed them, STREAMS.
