It was OK for the super-duper old IDE drives from the IBM/AT and 80386 era.
It was better for the ESDI drives because those tended to ship with a list
of bad blocks printed on the label (which was itself a carry over from the
MFM days). The MFM drives *did* have a DEC standard to list bad blocks and
reserve spare cylinders which was derived from the earlier rkXX drives.
bad144 was for the rkXX drives and then adopted, badly, for the newer
drives types and wasn't super-great by the time FreeBSD came along...
