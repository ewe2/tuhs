I adjusted my tools/dumpaout.py appropriately and tested with the 1ed
assembler.  If you sed all the files to s/mount/xmount/ it builds just
fine with 1ed "as" and the a.out header is indeed 6 bytes long and
is included in the text segment...  Everything is lining up..

So, I think those comment characters belong in the u0 sources, although
will have to be removed when compiling with a more recent assembler.
