GNU planned to adopt TRIX which was developed at MIT in the mid 1980s.
I don't know its exact distribution terms, but Wipikedia says "open
source" so it was possibly in that general vicinity.

Arguably ancient PDP-10 operating systems like ITS, WAITS, TENEX were
somewhat "open" and "free", but it's not a clear cut case.
