The idea is not unlike what I am hoping to be able to do, that is, make a 
system as close to "real" Unix as possible, and fully open-source / 
copyleft, where Linux really isn't "it", BSD is closer to this goal, and 
indeed NetBSD + Heirloom Toolchest is where I would start.  I'd like to 
see a system, and hell, if I could I'd implement it myself.  One that felt 
so like commercial Unix that you couldn't tell the difference unless you 
ran uname.  And had needed functionality without being uber-bloated like 
GNU.

-uso.
