From what I could read in the net (I was not able to get an old ksh source)
older ksh versions did call "vi" as external program to edit the history. 

This is why there still is the idiosyncratic "fc" command in ksh. With this 
interface, you could not type ahead as you first need to call "fc" to be able 
to edit a command line. Without type aead, there is no character loss with the 
original AT&T streams concept.
