Message-ID: <0006162012.AA01527@ivan.Harhan.ORG>

Quasijarus Consortium members and TUHS/PUPS archive users,

Today Tim Shoppa has read the HP300 4.4BSD-Alpha distribution on a 9-track 6250
BPI tape and I have just put it in the archive. It is in

Distributions/4bsd/4.4BSD-Alpha

Of course we generally don't do 4.4BSD, but we do include it in the archival
and preservation section of our project.

That suggestion got me looking at "The Unix History Graphing Project" at

  http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/Unix_History/index.html

Is there a readable (meaning "not source code") history of *.*BSD
on the McCusick CD set?  Most of the comment-type entries in the
Unix History Graphing Project for the BSD releases are pretty good,
but not real complete.

Do any of the Ultrix versions show up somewhere in the The Unix History
Graphing project?  I know that they're offshoots from 2BSD and 4BSD, but
I wouldn't mind seeing someone annotate when they shot off and what
was changed/added/deleted.  (Did I just volunteer?!?)

Another history question: Anyone know if there's any 2.9BSD-Seismo
distributions kicking around?

Tim.

The line of True UNIX development is straight:

V6 -> V7 -> 3BSD -> 4.0BSD -> 4.1BSD -> 4.2BSD -> 4.3BSD -> 4.3BSD-Tahoe ->
4.3BSD-Quasijarus

There is also a branch which I call Bostic BSD, resulting from Keith Bostic
taking over CSRG and killing it, that goes:

4.BSD-Tahoe -> Net/1 -> 4.3BSD-Reno -> Net/2 -> 4.4BSD-Alpha -> 4.4BSD

1BSD and 2BSD were collections of userland bits without a kernel or a compiler
toolchain or anything else that defines a system and its hardware platform, so
it's generally incorrect to consider them as versions of UNIX, much less as
versions of PDP-11 UNIX. They were bits to be added to an existing UNIX system,
which could conceptualy be anything, although V6 and V7 for the PDP-11 were the
intended targets.

Berkeley UNIX never ran on PDP-11s, only on VAXen, that is, there has never
been a Berkeley UNIX kernel or compiler toolchain for the PDP-11, only for the
VAX. As for 2.xBSD, that's an ex-post-facto backport of BSD UNIX to PDP-11s,
ex-post-facto in the sense that it was made after the torch of UNIX passed from
PDP-11 to VAX, and is a human-alien hybrid of PDP-11 V7 on steroids with dumbed
down VAX 4.xBSD. It comes nowhere near to mainline UNIX or mainline BSD.

I would like to ask that Mr. Solokov's association with the PUPS and TUHS
projects be ended if he can not restrain himself from posting inflammatory
material of this nature on the lists.

I second some form of censure here.  I already filter this person's email
when I can, via my mail handler and client, but I am still subjected to his 
non-constructive constant arrogance when included in other's replies.

Obviously I find his tact, social skills, and ethics reprehensible or I
wouldn't have bothered taking the measures I have.  Simply put, people
are welcome to their opinions, but his are bordering anti-social and 
are downright rude and insulting.

Everyone is welcome to opinions and points-of-view, but having such shoved
in faces at every opportunity is intolerable.

Regards,
Scott G. Taylor

I have to agree.  From his emails, Mr. Solokov is a rather rabid individual.

No, I agree with whomever it was - I think Patrick Henry - that said
something like "I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend
to the death your right to say it."

You can always send his mail to /dev/null if you don't like it.

While I do not agree with Michael's particular beliefs about True UNIX, as
I wear the hat of UNIX Heritage Society, I want to encourage his efforts on
4.3BSD-Quasijarus, as I do with 2.11BSD, NetBSD etc etc.

Michael, in order to ease the tension in the mailing lists, would it
be possible for you to write a web (or ftp) page describing your beliefs,
so that interested people can go read it. For example, in future mailings
you could say:

	As you know, I believe True UNIX flows from V6 to 4.3BSD
	but not to 4.4BSD, see http://xxx.xxx.xxx for details.

I'm not asking you to moderate your beliefs or stop espousing them, but
I would rather keep the mailing list inclusive rather than divisive.

For the other readers of this list, it is not possible to stop subscribers
from saying whatever they want. Therefore, if you feel offended, please
try to take any strong exchange of views out of the list. For example, you
might post something like:

	In article by Joe Bloe:
	> I think turtles are ugly.
	I disagree violently with this person's views, and I'll
	take this discussion off-line, so as to keep in charter
	with the mailing list.

I will also change the mailing lists's on-line charter to be inclusive
and not divisive.

Finally, we now have pups@ (PDP-11 stuff) and tuhs@ (generic Unix stuff,
which includes discussion on the Archive). The original posting, and all
the followups, should have gone to tuhs@, so please send your mails to
the right list!!!

Thank you,
	Warren

Yesterday I asked:

>Unix".  Steven, does this mean you know what's on this and how it's
>different than the 2.10 and 2.10.1 stuff already in the archive? :-)  Terry
>didn't remember...

Now that I've read the tapes, this is a 1990-ish step halfway between
2.10.1 and 2.11, as developed by Steven Schultz (and debugged by
Terry on his 11/70, judging from the comments.)  Is this something
worthwhile to put in the archive?  At the moment, looking at the
timeline of PDP-11 Unices currently in the archive, we have at the
"fairly recent" end:

2.9 from 1983
2.9.1BSD from 1983
2.10BSD from 1987
2.10.1BSD from 1989
2.11BSD from the past year

Would it be a worthwhile thing to put 2.10.2 up as an intermediate
step filling in the ten year gap between 2.10.1 and the current 2.11?
I'm worried that whenever I find a metric buttload of Unix tapes that my
proposals of adding everything in them to the archive may just be
adding too much volume that folks simply aren't interested in.

	You beat me to it - I was going to respond earlier but got distracted
	("real work" the boss wanted ;)).
	
	It's more than half way to 2.11 though.  Probably closer to 80 or 90%.
	The work had been going on for a year or more since 2.10.1 came out
	and I was all set to distribute it on my own when one of the last
	folks at the CSRG said it should be 2.11 (based on the size and number
	of changes) and a BSD release with USENIX handling the license issues
	and distribution.

	There aren't many major differences between 2.10.2SMS and what would
	be 2.11BSD a few months later (towards the end of 1990 or beginning
	of 1991).

	2.10.2.SMS goes till about the end of 1990 or beginning of 1991

	I think it would be - I didn't save a copy for myself ;)

	A "diff -r" of that against the first 2.11 tape (which I think I might
	have somewhere) would be interesting to do some time.

While I largely agree with your sentiments, I note that in responding to
my text above you have clipped out Michael's direct personal attack
on Keith Bostic.  I find this, um, fascinating.

I'll also note that denying Mr. Solokov *this particular forum* for
the spewage of his venom is hardly the kind of governmental interference
with speech that another poster's quotation decried.  I don't see why
PUPS/TUHS should provide a general soapbox for shouting insults at the
people who did a lot of the work PUPS/TUHS collect, catalog, and preserve.

Not to mention we owe the entire Open Source BSD availability to Keith.

Those that have not heard Kirk McKusick's "History of UNIX at Berkeley"
talk should go read his "Twenty Years of Berkeley Unix From AT&T-Owned to
Freely Redistributable" chapter in "Open Sources: Voices from the Open
Source Revolution".  This is on-line at
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/kirkmck.html.  To quote:

    During one of our weekly group meetings at the CSRG, Keith Bostic
    brought up the subject of the popularity of the
    freely-redistributable networking release and inquired about the
    possibility of doing an expanded release that included more of the
    BSD code. Mike Karels and I pointed out to Bostic that releasing
    large parts of the system was a huge task, but we agreed that if he
    could sort out how to deal with reimplementing the hundreds of
    utilities and the massive C library then we would tackle the kernel.
    Privately, Karels and I felt that would be the end of the discussion.
    
    Undeterred, Bostic pioneered the technique of doing a mass net-based
    development effort. He solicited folks to rewrite the Unix utilities
    from scratch based solely on their published descriptions.  Their
    only compensation would be to have their name listed among the
    Berkeley contributors next to the name of the utility that they
    rewrote.  The contributions started slowly and were mostly for the
    trivial utilities. But as the list of completed utilities grew and
    Bostic continued to hold forth for contributions at public events
    such as Usenix, the rate of contributions continued to grow.  Soon
    the list crossed one hundred utilities and within 18 months nearly
    all the important utilities and libraries had been rewritten.

    Proudly, Bostic marched into Mike Karels' and my office, list in
    hand, wanting to know how we were doing on the kernel. Resigned to
    our task, Karels, Bostic, and I spent the next several months going
    over the entire distribution, file by file, removing code that had
    originated in the 32/V release.

With what we owe him, I do not think any continual bad mouthing of Keith
should be tolerated.

For what it's worth I think this brings in an interesting branch to the
archive.  Should there be a space for stuff we should hold for purely
historical reference purposes and a different one for stuff that would
normally be interesting to the average user group punter?.  This might
have some effects on the archive structure.

It is *this* that I consider Bostic the killer of CSRG, of True BSD, and of
True UNIX for. I don't fscking care whether you call it free or not. The True
UNIX code is free to those who have access to it, in the sense that they can
make arbitrary modifications to it and freely redistribute it within the circle
of accessees. Pure UNIX is completely open source: it is not usable at all
without the source, so everyone who has it has the source. Either you have the
source or you don't run UNIX. No binary-only distributions. Previously the
circle of UNIX accessees was limited to universities, but then they were the
only ones who could afford the hardware needed to run UNIX and the electric
bills that come with it, so this really wasn't an issue. Someone who wasn't
part of a university with a UNIX source license was almost certainly in no
position to run UNIX or have an interest in it anyway. Now the situation has
changed, and many people run PDP-11s and VAXen on a hobbyist basis in their
homes, but the licensing situation has changed accordingly too: now it's a free
clickwrap license.

If it isn't Ritchie and Thompson's original UNIX code, then it isn't UNIX. And
I want UNIX, in four capitals with an R-in-circle superscript. I don't care
about clones and workalikes and copycats. However "modern" they are, they are
still mere clones and copycats. And I want the genuine article.

I think I understand what Michael is saying.  Or at least it means something
to me.

I don't have a lot vested here, nor have I always followed the issues with
PUPS and now TUHS.

Certainly a big part of this was running AT&T UNIX systems on these
machines.  And, TUHS might only ever be about UNIX as UNIX (R).

The fact that you COULD run a unix clone -- Linux, Open BSD, what have you
is fine.  We can argue that true BSD was a set of improvements or additions
to UNIX which may even have been sanctioned in part by the UNIX team.  But
the fact that you run Linux, Open BSD, MINIX or a MSDOS clone is not
pertinent to running UNIX System N.n

Using the GNU C Compiler is not pertinent to the AT&T K&R C compiler, per
se.

Is the ultimate purpose then of the list to keep the machines running
regardless of OS, or to run AT&T UNIX on these systems.

I won't fault Michael for his perspective.  But I guess we should agree to
define the parameters of the list, or agree NOT to define them.

  That might be fine and dandy for you, but other people do not share
your views
  and should not have to be criticized or belittled because they run
more "modern"
  hardware and not true UNIX.  We're not all living 20 years in the

That is a fine opinion, and one understandable.  BUT, I don't see Joy,
McKusick, or Lefler on your list.  So why is it again that you do 4.3BSD
rather than some System III/V + 2BSD??  Joy & McKusick modified the AT&T
kernel quite a bit.  Or did you not know that they touched that code.

Their work is an *extension* of the Ritchie/Thompson original UNIX, not a
replacement. 3BSD through 4.3BSD are direct logical successors of V7/32V
research UNIX.

Because I believe that 3BSD through 4.3BSD are the real trunk successors of V7
and 32V, not System III and System V (more affectionately known as Missed'em-
five as you can see in the Jargon File). True UNIX is Research UNIX, UNIX that
is for research purposes, not commercial ones. The AT&T Education Software
License I have buried in my desk somewhere prohibits any commercial use. System
III and V deserted this True UNIX mission, but Berkeley UNIX picked it up
instead.

Exactly the same later happened with 4.4BSD and 4.3BSD-Quasijarus.
