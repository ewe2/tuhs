Cool! Looking at Steve’s files, though, it looks like they could use some curating
since they are rather jumbled up. It’s great all the stuff that’s there is there, but
it makes it a bit hard to browse with tarballs inside of tarballs and multiple copies
of what looks like the same thing (but with differences).

Also, the mirrors mentioned in the Other/Coherent read me appear to be gone.
