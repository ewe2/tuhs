The only thing that .profile and .Xdefaults share is a leading '.'. While
the latter could be XML or JSON (almost, neither of those formats has
conditional expressions and .Xdefaults is run through cpp), the former
never could be XML or JSON in any sane universe.

So while some config stuff is stored in the dot files, its nature is
somewhat different.

Also, to use git as an example. my repo has a .git/config in it. For work
repos I put my work email and preferred spelling of my name. those go in
repo/.git/config. But for everything else, I have some global settings in
$HOME/.git/config. There are from time to time other reasons to tweak the
settings of a repo and have it be local to that repo only.

It's a tricky problem...
