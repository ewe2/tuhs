I'd suggest contacting Professor Harry Lewis at Harvard 
(lewis at harvard.edu).  We used Macro-11 for Unix in his "Intro to 
Data Structures" course in 1980.  

Since Professor Lewis is now a dean, this may take some 
persistence on your part, but I remember Professor Lewis as a 
decent sort (though busy, even in 1980) and I'm sure he'd be willing 
to help once he knows who you are.

BTW, I did verify that this was Macro-11 for Unix.  After some 
rummaging I was able to find (wonder of wonders!) my old "HRSTS 
Macro; Macro-11 Second Edition; 1/5/76" manual complete with 
Unix man pages for 'macro', 'linkr' and 'libr.'

Best of luck.

PS:  I've just read Tim Shoppa's post; the man pages contained in 
his email are identical to those in my manual (i.e., looks like you 
want m11).
