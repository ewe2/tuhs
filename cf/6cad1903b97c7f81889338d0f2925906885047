I was nominally a music major at S.F. State at that time, in the midst 
of my self-imposed avoidance of computers, that started with disdain 
from my initial exposure to Fortran on IBM 1620 at U of MO-Columbia in 
1964 and ended with semi-abandoning my rock and roll pursuits in early 
1971 and starting C.S. studies at UT-Austin. I also took math courses at 
S.F. State in 1968 but was unaware of the above cited "lab".

Regarding keyboarding skills, I took touch-typing in summer school after 
9th grade, got a SCM portable electric typewriter that I might still 
have, and am still grateful for QWERTY facility that has served me ever 
since, on card punch, 2741, 3270, Displaywriter, and more obscure and 
more modern keyboards.
