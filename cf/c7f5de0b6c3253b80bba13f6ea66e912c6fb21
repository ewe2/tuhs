That's correct. I believe there are also problems with p11 missing
a couple of timer interrupts. All of the complaints are entirely
appropriate, the whole thing needs major cleanup. I hope one of us
will finally get around doing some serious work on it again, soon.

It was a change to geni.c.   The Begemot I have (2.3) had apparent mods
already done for FreeBSD, but I still had to hack geni to resolv the
underscores.   it was a simple change though, as I recall.

I tried the patches against the virgin begemot 2.3 code, and I'm still 
seeing the unresolved's due to underscores.   Just FYI that they don't
apply to the Flea-3.0-CURRENT.

Thanks HEAPs tho ;)
