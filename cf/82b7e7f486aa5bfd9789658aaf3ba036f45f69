You've touched the point with a needle. This is exactly what I was
getting at. It's not a question of whether you want a better single
CPU or not, they don't exist, and one CPU is a tiny fraction of the
power in a modern distributed or parallel system.

And that's been the case for a long time now. Supercomputers are all
giant arrays of CPUs, there hasn't been a world-beating single core
supercomputer in decades.

And anything where power usage is key. If you're doing something that
computationally requires top-end single core performance you run the
4GHz core. Otherwise, you save a boatload of power and also
_cooling_ by going a touch slower. Dynamic power rises as the square
of the clock rate so you get quite a lot out of backing off just a
bit.

But it doesn't matter much even if you want to run flat out, because
no single processor can do what you want any more. There's a serious
limit to how much money you can throw at the vendors to give you a
faster core, and it tops out (per core) at a lot less than you're
paying your top engineers per day.

Your memory of this is the same as mine. I was also consulting to quite
similar customers at the time (most of my career has been consulting
to large investment banks. Haven't done much on the retail side though
that's changed in recent years.)

At the investment banks, the appetite for new Sun hardware when cheap
Linux on Intel was available was just not there. As you noted, too
many eggs in one basket was one problem, but another was the
combination of better control on an open source OS and just plain
cheaper and (by then sometimes even nicer) hardware.

Sun seemed to get fat in the .com bubble when people were throwing
money at their stuff like crazy, and never quite adjusted to the fact
that the world was changing and people wanted lots of cheap boxes more
than they wanted a few expensive ones.
