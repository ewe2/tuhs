I would like to experiment with Sam and run it on various *nix operating systems. There seems to be many ports.

Do I need to install some kind of Plan 9 emulation layer (in user space), which Sam builds and runs on? Obviously I'm referring to Russ Cox's libraries and user space tools.

Is it necessary to have a p9 environment to gain the most advantage of a tool like Sam? Or, is it possible for it still to function well as a transplant in a new environment such as *nix?

In that second case, what are the well ported versions of Sam that build and run directly on the target environment?
