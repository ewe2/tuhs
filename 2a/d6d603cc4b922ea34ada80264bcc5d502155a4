You may very well be correct. That would, however, seem to me to make
it _correct_, but still not necessarily _meaningful_ for trying to
determine the amount of memory used by a _specific_ process; and
similarly for the RSS.

On this, I believe I must stand corrected.

For my previous post, I checked the man page for ps, and noted that
RSS and VSZ are both reported in units of 1 KiB. For an attempt just
now, the ps output is similarly:

USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
michael  29890 51.8  0.7 2728696 255456 tty2   Sl+  21:46   0:06 firefox-esr
michael  29942  4.7  0.3 2415008 106448 tty2   Sl+  21:46   0:00 /usr/lib/firefox-esr/firefox-esr -contentproc -childID 1 -isF
michael  29994 38.3  0.7 34043160 240612 tty2  Sl+  21:46   0:04 /usr/lib/firefox-esr/firefox-esr -contentproc -childID 2 -isF
michael  30168  3.2  0.2 2400636 72992 tty2    Sl+  21:46   0:00 /usr/lib/firefox-esr/firefox-esr -contentproc -childID 3 -isF

On my system, unless I need to get a different calculator, 0.7% of
memory is either 229 ± <16 or 688 ± <49 MiB, depending on whether it
counts only RAM or also includes swap space.

The 249 MiB RSS of the main process also much more closely matches the
difference that was reported by `free` in my previous experiment.
Oddly, when trying the same thing again now, the difference as
reported by `free` is 423 MiB, so I'm not quite sure what's going on
there, but at least all of those numbers are considerably more
_plausible_, both in isolation and in relation to other relevant
measurements.

I'm honestly not sure how I went from the `ps` output (which wasn't
particularly dissimilar from the above, though of course I don't know
what the exact numbers were since I didn't record them) and the unit
of measurement being KiB, to going from KiB straight to GiB.

This is definitely a point on which I agree, and which I tried to
point out with the mention of shared libraries in my previous post.
