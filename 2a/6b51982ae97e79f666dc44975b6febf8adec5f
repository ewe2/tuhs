Subject: [pups] Duh - how do you format an RX50?
Message-ID: <002301c1b05f$4b317a40$c3e01840@rcs.ra.rockwell.com>

I can't believe I haven't figured this out yet. I bought an
RX50, and installed it in my PDP-11/53 running 2.11BSD. It's
nice having that empty hole in the front of the BA23 plugged,
but I hope for even more. The drive seems alive: if I say "cp
/dev/ra1a /dev/null", it starts groaning and ticking as if it
were reading the floppy.

But how do you format the floppies?

I tried XXDP/ZRQCH0 (downloaded via VTserver), but it says the
floppies are UNFORMATTABLE. That does that mean?
