Hard to call it a myth - it was quite available.  In fact, I never used a
single mainstream UNIX system from DEC, IBM, HP later Sun, Masscomp, Apollo
that did not have it, and many if not all small systems did also.

Yes, but after Tom Ferrin created vcat(1) in the late 1970s ('77 I think,
but I've forgotten).   Many people did have access to a plotter which cost
about $1k in the late 1970s,  or even later a 'wet' laser printer like the
Imagen which cost about $5K a few years later.

(and hardly anyone cared to use nroff to format things for line printers).

No offense, but that's just not true. Line printers and nroff were used a
great deal to prep things, and often UNIX folks had access to a daisy shell
printer for higher quality nroff output, much less using the line printer.

I did not know anyone that did that.   But I'll take your word for it.
Wordstar as I recall ran on 8-bit PCs.   The only two people I knew that
had larger CP/M systems back in the day that might have supported that were
Phil Karn (*a.k.a.* KA9Q of TCP/IP for CP/M fame) and Guy Soytomayer - both
were sometimes lab partners.  But all three of us had access to the XGP in
CMU CS dept, using Scribe on the PDP-10s, but we all used nroff most of the
time because we had more cycles available on the UNIX boxes and the 10s
required going to the terminal room.   FWIW: my non-techie CMU course
professors used to let you turning papers printed off the line printer and
people used anything they had - which was Scribe on the 20s and nroff on
the Unix, boxes and I've forgotten the name of the program that ran on the
TSS, which the business majors like my roommate tended to use.

The only time I had a deal with pure AT&T systems was occasionally at the
AT&T, but even there most of them that I worked, had BSD or Research, based
systems.   The only 3B2 I ever saw was the one we were forced to buy by
AT&T to get a System V source license at Stellar as the reference system,
when PDP-11 and Vaxen stopped being the default.   We did get ditroff from
the toolchest for it, since we were including it in the base Stellar
system.  The Apple Laserwriter was fully in the wild with transcript by
then, so vcat was not needed.

Sounds like you never had access to a plotter.

psroff was very, very late in the UNIX development.   vcat was nearly 10
years earlier, and psroff only showed up after the Apple Laserwriter which
is what - early 1985 I think.  But Versatec and the like plotter were all
over the place, much less daisy wheel printers.  True, the Hersey fonts
were not nearly as nice as PostScript and the resolution was only 200 dpi
(and it was a wet process) but most UNIX sites, particularly if you had
invested in Vaxen had them.

Excuse me...   most end-users sites had them.   Sun was the only one of the
majors that did not ship a C compiler with the system by default.  And as
Larry has pointed out, even that was fixed by rms fairly soon afterward.
But all of the suppliers of the majors UNIX implementations knew that you
got the C compiler with UNIX.   Jacks to open -- just include it.

It sounds like your early UNIX experiences were in a limited version, which
is a little sad and I can see that might color your thinking.

Yeech... sorry to hear that.

Hmmm ...  you were complaining you need a C compiler for ditroff, yet groff
needs C++ IIRC.?

Which means you need a Pascal compiler BTW .... and Tex was written using
the PDP-10 Pascal extensions, so you had to have a Pascal that understood
that.  Which was often not easy, particularly on UNIX boxes.  The UCB
Pascal !=3D PDP-10 Pascal.

My guess this observation is because HP was late to the Postscript world
and there while the eventual hpcat(1) was done for the vaxen and made it
the USENET, it was fairly late in time, and I'm not sure if anyone at HP or
anyone else ever wrote a ditroff backend for HP's PCL.

The key is that Apple Laserwriters were pretty cheap and since they already
did PS, most sites I knew just bought PS based ones and did not go HP until
later when PS was built-in.

Never used it, but I'll take your word for it.  I believe it is very Scribe
like and looking at it you can see in the influence.
