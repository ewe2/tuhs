Subject: [Unix-jun72] Change to mail list behaviour
Message-ID: <20080503124626.GA84693@minnie.tuhs.org>

After e-mailing a reply about 6 times today and it going to the original
poster, instead of the mailing list where I wanted it to go, I have
decided to change the behaviour of the unix-jun72 at tuhs.org list. Replies
will now go back to the list, not the poster.

It's an arbitrary decision; if you disklike it, let me know. If most
of you prefer it the other way, I'll switch it back!

Good night,
	Warren
