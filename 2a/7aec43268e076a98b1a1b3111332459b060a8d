I'm extremely jealous of you.  I'm a long time troff fan and would have
loved to have been there during that time.  I'm sure it was far less 
pleasant than my rose colored glasses have it, but it sure seems like
it was fun.  I'd like to have met Joe Ossanna - care to share any stories
about what sort of person, programmer, etc he was?

That's perhaps a whole different thread, I'd love to shove a beer into
each and every bell labs guy hanging around here and get them talking.
Bell Labs was a huge influence on me, be good to have Bell-labs-stories.com
or something filled with your memories.
