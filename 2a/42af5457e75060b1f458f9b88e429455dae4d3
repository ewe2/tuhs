I'm just reading Groklaw 
http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031119041719640 
and I'd have to say that  
SCO Group (Quote, Chart) CEO Darl McBride said his company is currently 
comparing source code awarded in a 1994 settlement between AT&T's (Quote, 
Chart) Unix Systems Laboratories and BSD, in which Berkeley's version of the 
Unix source was severed from the proprietary version. 
 
probably describes Darl and co., sitting around a trailerload of raw alcohol 
and scrawling something down on a piece of paper each time someone throws up. 
 
Nothing else describes their recent habits.
