I disagree with your characterization that things like Word are simpler tools.
They're way more complex than troff or TeX, both in code and usability.

FYI, last time I saw Don he was asked what his biggest mistake ever was.
His response was making the basic unit size in TeX a power of 2 instead
of a power of 10.

While I'm at it, a shill also asked him what his favorite joke was.  His
answer:
  A guy goes into the county clerk and asks to legally change his name.
  The clerk asks "What would you like to change it to?"
  The guy responds "Control G".
  The clerk says "That rings a bell."
