Yeah, because "lspci" was not hard enough to type.

Also, in Unix resources have a name when the kernel has a driver to be
able to know about those resources. But "lspci" can list also hardware
for which the kernel knows no driver (not a typical need in "pure UNIX"
running on a PDP-11 or PDP-8, I guess).

"lspci" is akin to "fdisk -l", for when you need to know what is laying
under the running kernel, at a level lower than the kernel abstractions
for the hardware which it knows about (i.e, hardware for which it has
a driver).

Which brings up a question I have: why didn't UNIX implement ethernet
network interfaces as file names in the filesystem? Was that "novelty" a
BDS development straying away from AT&T UNIX?
