What do you mean by "permit cut (and) paste to work"?  Do you want to be 
able to cut (triple click the entire line in Xterm) and then paste it 
(middle click a new line) and have it execute?  Or do you mean that you 
want it to not execute as a safety measure?

Or are you wanting to go one step further and have something that 
toggles input interpretation off until a character sequence is provided, 
possibly by the prompt?  Ideally so that you would not accidentally copy 
& paste swaths of screen output and have it executed.
