How do we kill this meme?  Linux is open to contribution by volunteers
but the overwhelming majority of the work done on the OS for *at least*
the last ten years has been by professionals who are paid to work on
Linux.  Pretending otherwise is disingenuous, and anyway I'm not sure
why the OS that powers pacemakers and self-driving car research gets to
be held to a lower standard.
