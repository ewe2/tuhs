Yeah, I was originally intending to go into the M68k systems and wandered
into the 700 series by mistake.

I decided that emulation was probably the way to go.  NetBSD and OpenBSD on
the 700 , as well as PARISC Linux seems to be sailing into the duldrums.
Where I would expect it to be strong based on the lack of OS choices.  But
I'm not an architecture guy, so I imagine there is a lot of proprietary
stuff in the box that makes portin a challenge.

Thanks,

Mike
