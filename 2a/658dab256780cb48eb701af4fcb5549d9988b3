Subject: [TUHS] What's with the DZ-11?
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.11.1411270742130.30791@aneurin.horsfall.org>

I've seen a couple of less than flattering references here; what was the 
problem with them?

At UNSW, we couldn't afford the DH-11, so ended up with the crappy DJ-11 
instead (the driver for the DH-11 had the guts ripped out of it in an 
all-nighter by Ian Johnston as I recall), and when the DZ-11 came along we 
thought it was the bees' knees.

Sure, the original driver was as slow as hell, but the aforesaid IanJ 
reworked it and made it faster by at least 10x; amongst other things, I 
think he did away with the character queues and used the buffer pool 
instead, getting 9600 on all eight channels simultaneously, possibly even 
full-duplex.
