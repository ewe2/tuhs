Thanks, I'll take a look at that too.

I'm quite familiar with this. I'm the one who posted the original C version
of se to comp.sources.unix > 30 years ago.  :-)

It's quite ironic. To get se going on Unix I had to learn vi. Then
vi became hardwired into my finger ROMs such that I didn't feel like
going back to using se.

se is derived from the Software Tools Ratfor editor, so it's an ed
clone, not based on Unix ed code.
