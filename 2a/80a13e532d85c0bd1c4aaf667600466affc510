In my first days as a UNIX user (mid 70's), operating at 110 baud,
mechanical tabs were much faster than multiple spaces. And with
now-laughably small disks, saving space in files was a consideration, too.
Neither should matter now, but early training can be difficult to overcome.

I find it easier to read code when statements aren't split across
multiple lines (and therefore sometimes across pages). So I'm now inclined
to favor smaller tab-stops.
