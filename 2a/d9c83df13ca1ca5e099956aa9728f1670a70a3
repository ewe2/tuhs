OK, I am trying to maintain a neutral stance to SCO, even though they're
making it hard to do, but why does the above sound to me like trying to
get extra ammo they can use in court?  I mean I can already envision the
way the talks will go: "But your honour, we are heavily dependent on our
source code, since we are planning to unveil the SVR6 product in August
and the things which happened with IBM and Linux put our plans in
jeopardy..."

Ohh, now I get it.  Where on earth do they get the SCO Linux pedigree
and heritage from?  I very much doubt that Linus was doing stuff based
on SCO.  (Hey, everyone with a bit of clue of what happened knows it was
based upon Minix, sort of, but definately not SCO stuff.)

I seriously, seriously wonder where this is leading to.  The USA does
not have the best track record where it comes to sensible court rulings,
but if they have any Unix expert present he can refute a lot of the
so-called claims SCO is making.

This reminds me a lot of U-571, where Hollywood rewrote part of the real
world history for storyline sake.
