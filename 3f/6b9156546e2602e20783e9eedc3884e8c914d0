It should have been something like  (list-length (command-list-fn)) but
I'll bet that ? was bound to a complicated function that just displayed the
results and didn't properly abstract out the UI (printing) from the data
collection (getting a list), which is what made it so hard. I've had so
many gnu emacs experiences like this over the years, but to the community's
credit, there's fewer and fewer as time goes by.

ObUnix: This shows the power of having the right abstractions and being
disciplined to code to those ideal abstractions any time there might be
reuse...
