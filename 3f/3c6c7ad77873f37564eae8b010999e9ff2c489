Hello from Gregg C Levine
Um this fellow, Ken Thompson. According to my copy of the book on the
C programming language, only Brian Kernighan, and David Ritchie, are
mentioned. Ken Thompson, is only mentioned as being a partner in the
creation of UNIX, I think he was a co-author in the book mentioned in
titles pages, describing the UNIX programming environment. 

And yes, the rest of the article did look okay, around that.
