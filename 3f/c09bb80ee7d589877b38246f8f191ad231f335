Not to put too fine a point on it, It seems like it would be fair to say
Multics was 'complete' by the time Organick published his book: *"**The
Multics System: An Examination of Its Structure**.*" Amazon says the 3rd
printing was April 72, so that means he must have published it earlier.  I
don't know when it first appeared and can not seem to find it.  My copy is
in storage but I bet I have the 3rd printing.   But I had >>thought<< that
was still in the late 1960s.   Anyone have a first edition around with the
publication date?
