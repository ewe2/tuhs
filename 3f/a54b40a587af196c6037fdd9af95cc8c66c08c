I have collected old version of GNU Emacs.  19.x is well covered.  18.x
less so.  Noah Friedman had 16.56, and I found two releases of Emacs 17
and one I believe to be version 13!

Other historical Unix Emacsen: MicroEMACS 30 from Dave Conroy, Gosling
Emacs, Warren Montgomery/BTL/ATT/unixpc Emacs, EMACS-11 by Fred Fish.
