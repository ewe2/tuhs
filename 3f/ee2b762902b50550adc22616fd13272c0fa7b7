Never heard of that port.   I was involved with IBM on the AIX for the 370/i386/i860 products.   AIX/370 ran under VM/370.   It was entirely ASCII using the TCF to use the i386 for a combination of consoles (IBM dubbed the “high function terminal” which we had the i860 version called the Low Function Terminal) along with X.
