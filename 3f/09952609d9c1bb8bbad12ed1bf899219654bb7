Herr Doctor Wkt:

  Does anybody have a PDF of the 1974 Unix CACM paper, I seem to have
  misplaced my copy.

=======

It appears to be generally available via the ACM Digital Library,
of all places.  (No, I'm not so smart: Google pointed me there.)

It appears to be the genuine 1974 version, though my paper copy
of that issue of CACM is buried behind too many boxes right now
for me to dig it out and check.  Disk storage for `The PDP-11/45
on which our UNIX installation is implemented' is as Warren
describes for the 6th Edition update: 1MB fixed-head disk,
four 2.5MB removable-cartridge drives, and a single 40MB
removable-pack drive.
