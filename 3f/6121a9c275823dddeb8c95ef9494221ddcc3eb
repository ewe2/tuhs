I dont know if it's worth even trying to find and mirror pre 1993 ( IE when cheap CD-ROM mastering was possible) GNU software?

Things like binutils, gas, and GCC can be tremendously useful, along with binaries for long "dead" platforms?

I know that I've always been super thankful of the GNAT people for having some pre-compiled version of the ADA translator which would also include GCC. Sometimes having some kind of native toolset is a big positive, when you don't have anything, especially earlier versions that have issues cross or Canadian cross compiling.
