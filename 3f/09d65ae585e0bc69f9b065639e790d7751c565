The thrust meter project -- was that an analog meter that displayed % 
CPU utilization? I remember that Tom Ferrin had one mounted in the 
middle of a DEC panel filler on the 11/70 at the Computer Graphics 
Lab at UCSF. It was really delightful having this analog meter 
bouncing up and down as people worked away.
