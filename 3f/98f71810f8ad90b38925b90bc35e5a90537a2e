I completely agree. This is ridiculous. Do modern programmer's seriously 
think that the old code wasn't complex or robust? Sheesh, there's code 
out there that has run through more millions of transactions an hour for 
more years than most of these folks have been alive. There's also code 
that's been running without any updates, for decades. Most code written 
by the newbreed won't run for a month without surfacing dozens of bugs. 
Margaret Hamilton would prolly have some choice words for these folks.

did you ever write a program which does heavy malloc()/free()
on complicated (i.e., shared) data structures *and* runs for
days, perhaps weeks? IMO it's very difficult to do this without
