Subject: [TUHS] OK, the archive has been reorganised
Message-ID: <20170222001658.GA25054@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, after getting your feedback, I've reorganised the Unix Archive at
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/

I'm sure there will be some rough edges, let me know if there is anything
glaringly obvious.

I'd certainly like a few helpers to take over responsibility for specific
sections, e.g. UCB, DEC.

Cheers all, Warren

P.S It will take a while for the mirrors to pick this up.
