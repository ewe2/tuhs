Actually, the closest I've seen DLE being used was in SLIP and PPP; if you
needed to send a Frame End then it was escaped with (I think) 0xFF, and that
in turn was escaped.  All it took was a finite state machine...  Of course,
those links used RTS/CTS, but you had to flag the end of a frame (packet)
somehow.
