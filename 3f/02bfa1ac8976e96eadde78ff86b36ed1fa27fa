I was under that impression - I had referred to it in my message as the
'pre-Judge Green release rules.'

Right.

I remember seeing se -- Brian Redman showed it to me IIRC.  I never tried
using it myself.  I remember that he was not happy that it was not vi.   If
I recall the argument in USG was many of the BSD tools were not better or
even as good as what USG had already created.  But the USG folks did
eventually add some of them to their stream because so many internal sites
were already using them.  In particular, v, csh and col -- but there were
others too and the argument was we have those tools covered already i.e. pg
vs. more or se vs. vi
