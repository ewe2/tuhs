You want to add another drive?   The lower 3 bites selects the partition, the upper bits (shfited right 3) are the drive number.
The second disk (to match your first) would use 6,8 and 6,15 and 14,8 and 14,15 respectively.

To put it differently, it doesn't seem correct to me to use 6,1 for the block device or 14,1 for the character device on the new drive as it's a completely different disk from rp0 and rp3 which are just partitions on the first drive and have 6,0, 6,7, and 14,0, 14,7. If each RP can have 8 partitions and there can be 8 drives, what is the correct major, minor numbers to use with v7 for multiple devices?
