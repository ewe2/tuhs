At long last!

Earlier hints from research!gerard:

"We do know that the paint itself was vouchered a few days
later as a business expense by Fred Grampp, on behalf of a
pseudo-employee G.R. (Grace) Emlin (login: gremlin), who had
at that time already been entered successfully into most
official databases at Bell Labs, and regularly received mail
at her mailbox at 2C-501 (the Unix room)."
