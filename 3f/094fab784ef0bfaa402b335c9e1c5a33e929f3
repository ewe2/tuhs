The numbering system seems vaguely similar to BSPs (
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System_Practices).

There are top level BSP sections for the 3B2 and 3B20 among other
interesting history to this community.  For some reason the telephone
community hasn=E2=80=99t done a good job of digitizing the complete BSPs no=
r a
modern index (I physically browsed an index from the early 90s but someone
disappeared it from where I did so).  I=E2=80=99ve heard are private collec=
