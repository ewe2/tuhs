One would hope so, but that was the strategy that got them eaten by a
grue.  Another funny anecdote about this aloofness.. Linux on sparc64
uses the Relaxed Memory Order mode that the hardware offers .
Solaris.. Total Store Order.  There are tons of things like this in
the code that blow my mind.  I would have been pissed if I were on the
hardware side of SPARC.

Hmm, I think they've been pretty earnest at wanting to be 2+ years
ahead of the general market with POWER for as long as I can see, lots
of HPC money has been subsidizing that.  Depends on the workload but
bus and memory bandwidth right now with PCIe Gen4 and NvLink can
really cut down on server sprawl.  I've met with the GM/chief
architect and they see OpenPOWER positioned as a full frontal
competitor to Intel Xeon.  I'm fairly disappointed in my
contemporaries for not recognizing the value of a completely open
source firmware and on chip controller stack; especially after the
recent snafu where Intel changed the microcode license to disallow
benchmarks and claimed it was an accident.

Your statements make sense to me with respect to AIX, as Linux has
been the main effort since the 2000s.  GPFS looks neat, I wish it were
open or at least internals documented well enough to study the
implementation academically.

That's probably the dirty little secret.  It's long been profitable to
carefully plan software interrupt handlers, user threads, and memory
allocation even on pedestrian servers if they are running a fixed
function.  I guess Google's Borg and the new workalikes could do
semi-automagic things with cgroups these days.  There is evidence of
people getting pretty crazy with it when we see things like Intel
cache allocation features.

Agreed, one of these companies is doing pretty well with a fat
dividend yield, that other has basically been dismantled for all but a
couple remaining desirable platform control points like Java and
MySQL.

Many things in tech are happy accidents and a small number of
motivated people at the right place and time.  A Sun engineer admitted
on some video I've seen that the green light was really given for ZFS
because they got stumped by some UFS bugs.. once enough of ZFS was
written to test the end to end checksumming features they found out
some of these heisenbugs were LSI HBA and disk firmware issues :o)

Surveying some of these filesystems.. JFS2 is a decent, nowhere near
the capabilities of ZFS but even today it's not in dire need of
replacement.. I suspect another issue complementary to your point is
the standalone storage business is many $B of revenue.  ESS/DS8000 and
the like are preferred revenue.  IBM and HP were more in the SAN game
than Sun and SGI who let the customers configure systems themselves be
used as storage (Sun was using VxFS for a long time, SGI had some CXFS
things IIRC).  Tru64 had a pretty interesting filesystem on paper,
curious if you ever looked at its design since they open sourced it.

Kevin
