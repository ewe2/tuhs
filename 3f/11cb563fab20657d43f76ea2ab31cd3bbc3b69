Subject: [TUHS] VAX SysVr2: tape /dev entries missing
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.20.1703180607280.2245@meaghan.sj.gimme-sympathy.org>

All,

Seems my SysVR2 simulation instance has at one point or another lost its 
/dev/mt/* and /dev/rmt/* device entries.

Is there a script anywhere to regenerate these, or does anyone know the 
major/minor off hand for the SIMH TS device?
