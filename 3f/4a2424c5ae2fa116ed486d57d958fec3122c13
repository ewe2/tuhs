​If it was 78, it was probably v6+ of some sorts running Chesson's Arpanet
NCP from Illinois.​  UNIX/TS (aka V6+++ / pre V7) sorts of oozes out via
the Bell Labs' OYOC like Ted in '78 - that's what we ran at CMU since Ted
brought it with him. Its a heavily hacked V6 kernel and many of what would
become the v7 utilities including the a new compiler and the standard I/O
library.   Same was true of PWB 1.0 - which was based on most of the code.
   Dennis would not formally get V7 (which had an updated kernel) released
until mid '79 (FWIW: The date on a number of the files in the V7
distribution tapes in Warren's archives show Aug 1, '79 - which sounds
about right for when Dennis got it out).
