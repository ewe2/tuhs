Doug, all, I thought I'd have a go at the reconstruction too, so we have
a basis for comparison. Attached are my reconstructed files. I haven't had
a chance to unpack Doug's files yet.

I can't get the C files to compile with the V2 compiler, as the source code
uses a later version of the language (e.g. char *argv[]).
