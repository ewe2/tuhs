The DZ was always looked down upon in my shops.   The problem is that it interrupts the processor on every output character which isn’t particularly efficient.   We used the DH-11 and as previously mentioned when able came out with the single board DH/DM-11 clone, we used those.

I also had some goofy board (DQ) that allowed you to load a character table on when you wanted interrupts on input (you could program it for new line and whatever your INTR/QUIT/ERASE/KILL, etc… were) but I never got around to writing the driver for that.
