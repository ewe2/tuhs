The book "The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD Unix Operating
System" by Leffler et al has a lengthy explanation of booting 4.3BSD on the
VAX towards the beginning of the book. Could that be it? I thought I had a
copy in my office, but don't see it on my bookshelf at the moment. Bach's,
"The Design of the Unix Operating System" contains a brief and very
high-level overview in the chapter on process control, but I recall Leffler
et al having significantly greater detail.
