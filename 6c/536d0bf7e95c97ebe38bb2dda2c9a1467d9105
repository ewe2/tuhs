There's two references in the termcap manpages:
http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/man/terminfo.5.html
and
http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/man/curs_add_wch.3x.html

The second link mentions that the AT&T 4410 terminal added this glyph in the location of the VT100 VT glyph. Apparently what it looked like is lost, unless someone finds a detailed 4410 manual (or has a working one in the attic).
