I am grateful to Warren too, for a mailing list needs to be curated,
and he is putting a lot of valuable time and wise effort into that job!

However, I chimed in just to note that the decision, however legitimate
and based on the list owner's best criterion, is not an "unanimous
feeling".

I hope I can be in disagreement while respecting Warren's decision.
