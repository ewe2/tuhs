Building gcc as a cross compiler can be quite challenging.

Dan Kegel has put together a set of scripts which largely automate the 
process
and which can be found at http://www.kegel.com/crosstool/

Unfortunately (but not surprisingly) pdp11 is not on of the targets 
supported
by crosstool, but you might still find it useful as an illustration of 
the kinds of
things that may need to be done.
