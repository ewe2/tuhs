Actually, I had a Model 37 (ASR) in my house for a while (originally property of Rocky Flats Weapons Center).    It had a big NEWLINE key on it and it's one of the few terminals where you didn't have to turn on cr/nl mapping.    It also dealt with all those ESC-8 and ESC-9 characters and the like that nroff put out by default.   It also put had a big green PROCEED light that came on with DSR or CD on the serial interface.    Mine didn't have the greek type box that you switched in and out with SHIFT IN / SHIFT OUT characters and yes, an unprogrammed HERE IS drum.

One neat feature about the RUBOUT (or DELETE) character is that it was "all ones" in binary.    The way you'd correct errors in off-line generated paper tape was to backspace the punch and then hit rubout.   The input device would subsequently ignore any such characters.
