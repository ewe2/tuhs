Where do you see u defined? I only see it declared as external:

extern struct user u;

You need one single global u definition (memory reservation) so all
sources accessing u accessing the same struct, don't you? At least
this is what I have here and there is also the memory adress in my
param.h:

# define UBASE             0x3E00F600      /* kernel virtual addr of  
user struct */

This is where "u" is located on my system.
