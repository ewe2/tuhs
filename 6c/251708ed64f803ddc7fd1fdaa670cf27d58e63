If you email me a tar file (or zip) I can put it on my website.  I can
receive email up to about 10mb. If it's larger than that I can set up
with an ftp account.

I'd also be happy to write a script to diff the files.

yes - I found a program I wrote a while back which takes an a.out and
turns it into a simh "load format".  With that it's pretty easy to load
and go in simh.

The v1 man pages explain the "bos" load setup and give the rf bootstrap
code.  It should be pretty easy to boot up a "cold" version which preps
the RF. I'm not sure about loading the file system from dectape however,
but who knows, even that might be possible.
