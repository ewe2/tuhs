It was around 1983 or so when I bought a CP/M system, I think an
Okidata.  It was a weird, but fun, machine, had a printer built
into the base behind the keyboard, dual 5" floppies, 128K less
the bitmapped color display.  $2000.

It was slow but dramatically faster than 1/32-164th of a 1MB VAX 780.
