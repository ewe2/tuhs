I haven't done it in many years, but after you get the machine to
boot into RT11 you can disable the TSX security stuff.  Probably a file
named "STARTF.COM" is the initial RT11 startup and it contains the
command to chain to TSX.

I suppose the easiest break-in tool would be a floppy disk with a bootable
RT11 on it.
