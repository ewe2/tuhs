It's but the first step on the road to understanding. I'd been working on
the FreeBSD kernel for years when I re-read the Lions book. The stark
simplicity of the v6 kernel helped everything suddenly 'click' into place
in the code I was reading in the FreeBSD kernel, even with 30ish years of
changes to the v6 code base that lead to the FreeBSD kernel...

Newer systems are a lot more complicated. And they need to be to get the
full performance out of the system. Yet understanding the basics without
the extra clutter has great value.
