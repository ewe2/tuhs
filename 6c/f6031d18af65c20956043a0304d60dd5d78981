The current SCCS certainly takes subcommands, but I have no idea if it 
started out that way.

ifconfig is more a set of flags than subcommands.

And don't get me started about dd - who wrote that anyway? Must have 
been an IBM guy :)

dd breaks all the norms for using shell wildcard expansions. You can't 
do: dd if=*.tar of=/dev/rmt/0cbn bs=128k

Assuming, of course, you only had one tar file you wanted to write to tape.

I think the first time I noticed it was CVS, which made you say `cvs co ...` where RCS & SCCS had a bunch of individual commands (actually: did SCCS?).  But I think it's possible to argue that ifconfig was an earlier example of the same thing.  I was thinking about dd as well, but I don't think that's the same: they're really options not commands I think.
