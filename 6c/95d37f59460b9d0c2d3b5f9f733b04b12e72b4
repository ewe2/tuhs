Off topic, but looking for help and wisdom.

If you visit https://www.scotnet.co.uk/iain/ =
<https://www.scotnet.co.uk/iain/>saratov you will see some photos of =
work that I have started on the front panel of a Capatob2.

I plan to get the switches and lights running on a blinkenbone board =
with a PDP8 emulation behind it.  (I already have an PDP11/70 =
front-panel running on the same infrastructure)

I have been struggling for over a year to get much info about this =
saratov computer (circuit diagrams etc).  So I have started the reverse =
engineering on the panel.

Does anybody know anything about this computer?  online or offline it =
would be much appreciated.
