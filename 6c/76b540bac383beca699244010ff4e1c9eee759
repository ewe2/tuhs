My boss 23 years ago (who was at CMU in the eighties working on systems
like these) told me that on some systems, when cleaning up wtmp, it's
necessary to truncate the wtmp file (i.e. cat /dev/null into it -- never to
flat out remove it) because something in the system doesn't let go of the
inode (or somesuch) that it thinks the file was on.  I never understood why
but have done what he told me since then :)

I wonder if this has something to do with your phenomenon.

      If you modify your system to add dci lines and you enable some

      something in /usr/adm/wtmp, if it exists, and then loop (very

      this will hardly be noticeable on modern hardware running simh,
      but I&#39;m guessing this would have been disastrous, back in the day=
.<br>
      <br>
      The simple solution is to boot w/dci enabled when you have ttys
      enabled, and only boot w/o dci enabled when you have disabled the
      ttys.<br>
      <br>
