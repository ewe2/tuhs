Rob Pike:

  Yeah, p is all we need. I think it originated with td at UofT. I might have
  brought it with me to Bell Labs, or recreated it. Probably the former.

The former, I think.  The source code in V10 is very similar
to that you left behind at Caltech (where I first encountered
p).  Most differences have to do with using opendir and readdir
rather than reading raw directories in the SPname code.

A further clue is that, even in V10, p.c begins

/*%cc p.c pad.o spname.o
 */

The tool that looked for such lines to tell it how to compile
things (I forget its name; was it comp?) doesn't seem to have
survived in the archival backup I have from Caltech HEP, but
I'm quite sure it came from U of T as well.
