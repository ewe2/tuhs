From what I read, you are correct -it doesn't. At least that's what the FSF
appears to say themselves:
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLAndNonfreeOnSameMachine
There's been some attempts over the years (eg Microsoft's "get the facts"
campaign) to muddy the waters on that issue and paint the GNU license as
acting "cancerous"; but I'm not aware of any legal precedents backing that
up.

Another part of the same page that you might find interesting (regarding
distributing sources):
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#DistributeWithSourceOnInternet

Of course if someone is acting as an owner or employee of a company they'll
want to consult their legal staff in addition to reading what the GNU have
to say as well.

/disclaimer; I do not work in IT, but have used Unix and Linux for 25 years
now -make of that what you will
