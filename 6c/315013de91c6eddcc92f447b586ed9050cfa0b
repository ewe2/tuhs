Yes, as Milo points out, an M68K model, for which afaik no emulator  
exists. The original hardware can still be bought on ebay, or from  
http://www.blackholeinc.com/ (if they are still responsive).

However you should be able to run NEXTSTEP/Intel (which means a late  
version like 3.3) on emulated hardware (QEMU, Bochs, etc), which  
coincidentally is what I've been trying to do this week.

Several versions of TBL's browser (M68K and Intel binaries for  
NEXTSTEP 3.3) can be found at http://browsers.evolt.org/?worldwideweb/ 
NeXT
