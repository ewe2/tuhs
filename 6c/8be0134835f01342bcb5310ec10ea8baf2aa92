Sorry to flog this topic, but the two examples below are an
unfair comparison. What happened to the multiplications in the
second?  And  two of the [enter]s in the first are unnecessary.
Ironically three of the four operations in the second are
actually reverse Polish!  If you had to utter sqrt first,
as we do on paper and in speech, things wouldn't look so great.

[a] [enter]
[a] [enter]
[multiply]
[b] [enter]
[b] [enter]
[multiply]
[add]
[square root]


[a]
[square]
[plus]
[b]
[square]
[square root]
