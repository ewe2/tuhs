I believe I have found the problem. Upon closer inspection, I noticed
that the ribbon cable that I am using is terminated in such a way that
the conductors are exposed on the outside of the top of the female
connector. Looking at the DL11-W, I saw that there is an uncovered
trace on the circuit board just below the pins of the BERG connector.
It appears that the exposed conductor ends of the cable were making
contact with this trace, which shorted the entire cable together. I
covered the exposed ends with a piece of electrical tape and the whole
setup now works precisely as intended.

Frankly, I'm just glad that there doesn't appear to be any lasting damage.

Thank you Michael and Noel for your help; I'm sure I'll be back with
more questions as I make progress with this machine.

Yours,

Mark D. Hare
