I'm not sure what I did, but it wasn't the latter, since I have no idea how
they are done!

I just mentally break the regex search string up into substrings (I use them
most in Epsilon, which has syntax to do substrings of search strings, which
helps a lot); past that, I think it's just using them and getting used to
them.

IBM's last 36-bit scientific mainframe before the System/360's. CTSS (which
DMR held out as the ancestor of Unix) ran on 7094's.
