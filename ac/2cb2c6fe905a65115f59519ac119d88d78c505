I'm not sure that interpretation is correct. I think that trace shows signal()
being called from sysinit().

On V6, signal() was a system call which one could use to set the handlers for
signals (or set them to be ignored, or back to the default action). In. 2.11
it seems to be a shim layer which provides the same interface, but uses
the Berserkly signal system interface underneath:

  https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=2.11BSD/include/signal.h
  https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=2.11BSD/man/cat3/signal.0

So maybe the old binary for kermit is still trying to use the (perhaps
now-removed) signal system call?
