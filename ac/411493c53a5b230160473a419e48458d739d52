I was there at the time (bash was the first thing Linus ported to Linux)
and I have to say it was the combination of the availability, since the
BSDs were still encumbered, the accessibility, since its hardware demands
were very modest, and the FSF's enthusiastic porting of all the GNU apps
to it. It was the perfect student/starting system for the time.  You can
talk about lost opportunities, but it was the right system at the time,
and I say this as a BSD guy from way back.
