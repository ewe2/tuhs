Uh. I'm no language expert, but that seems rather stretched. English 
comes from Old English, which have a lot more in common with 
Scandinavian languages, and they are all Germanic languages. Which means 
they all share a common root.

What makes you say then that all the others borrowed it from English? I 
would guess/suspect that the term is older than English itself, and the 
similarity of the word in the different languages comes from the fact 
that it's old enough to have been around when all these languages were 
closer to the roots and each other. Boats have been around for much 
longer than the English language so I would suspect some term for them 
have been around for a long time too...

If you ask me, you all got most terms from the Vikings anyway, who were 
the first good seafarers... :-)
(I assume you know why Port and Starboard are named that way...)
