Pat,
	Any such description is either going to be very hardware/system =
specific, or vague to the point of uselessness. The experience of the NetBSD =
community, which prides itself on extreme portability and working around broken =
or  ... let's say "incomplete" vendor firmware, is that such things are highly =
system-specific.

The vague description is easy:

	some booter or firmware loads the kernel into RAM,

	the kernel initializes the MMU and the rest of the processor(s),
	devices are somehow probed or listed and device drivers called to
	initialize minimally necessary I/O devices (console, data storage so
	you can mount / (root)),

	a process is created, and /sbin/init is exec'd.

Details of firmware or booter provided environment and parameters to the kernel =
vary a lot; thus that famously small-ish percentage of any Unix kernel that =
is written in assembler for the processor involved, rather than C.
