Subject: [TUHS] The Tim Shoppa distribution of V6
Message-ID: <000501c21f89$ee71a100$28ba580c@who>

Hello again from Gregg C Levine
On the FTP site, is a a V6 distribution contributed by Tim Shoppa. It is
created for the PDP-11/23, and there is a good readme.txt file that explains
the different images, and how they got there. However, has anyone actually
gotten the distribution to boot, using a version of Simh? A text file of
commands to be fed to the Simh program would be a great help.
I have mine, built using the MingW compiler, and this is version 2.9-10.
Also, if anyone has gotten it to boot on real hardware, that would a be a
great plus.
