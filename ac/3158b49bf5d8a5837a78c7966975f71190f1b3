As it says there,



*The hermeneutics of naming yields few insights. Things are named usually
because the name is nice (sam), or there is some private reference hard to
decode (8=C2=BD), or in honour (perhaps backhanded) of another system (moth=
ra),
or an indication of expectation (Plan 9, acme), or just because (acid).
None of the names tell you anything helpful.Despite the lack of
information, those who guess at reasons for naming generate volumes of
apocrypha. The real reason is usually, ``because''.*
