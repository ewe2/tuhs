I looked, and it too says next to nothing about Unix (which it describes as a
"programming language" - pg. 346). Oh well.

This is really a pretty serious omission, given that the vast majority of
mobile devices now run Android, which is a Unix derivative (Linux). So just
about everyone has a Unix-derived thing in their pocket.
