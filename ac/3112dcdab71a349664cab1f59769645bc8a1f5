You're welcome. It's a fun side project. I think I finally get the
enjoyment of retrocomputing with emulated versions of systems one
used in one's youth. :-)

I don't think it can support more than 2 drives. Certainly the emulator
cannot. I don't know about real hardware.

You can split a big drive into partitions when formatting with the
diagnostics disk, but I don't think that's what you're asking.

Sorry,

Arnold
