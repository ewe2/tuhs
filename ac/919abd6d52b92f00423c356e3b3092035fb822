No, it derives from V7, with much stuff from 4BSD back-ported to the =
PDP11. See the =E2=80=9CEarly BSDs=E2=80=9D section of the Unix Tree =
(https://minnie.tuhs.org//cgi-bin/utree.pl). Although V8 also has some =
4BSD roots, the V8/V9/V10 lineage is different from the 2.8-2.11 BSD =
lineage. There was a lot of code sharing back then, it is not a simple =
picture.
