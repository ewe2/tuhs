Hi.

I have this nice KXJ11-CA but I have no clue how to use it. I was able
to get to the ODT prompt, but nothing else. I need pinouts, jumper
descriptions, memory map (where are the EPROMs?), ... How to use that
digital IO port? ...

My idea is to use it in a my MicroVAX 4000-200 with the VAX as "frontend
processor". So I would be able to run NetBSD/vax and perhaps 2.9BSD in
the same box.
