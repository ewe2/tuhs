Hi,

I remember that PL-1 was regarded in the 70-80ths as a superior programming=
 language, incorporating the best concepts of the languages Mary enumerated=
. There even was a PL-1 inspired SPL language by siemens for the bs2000 mai=
nframe os including bit fields etc. for system programming like C. Large pa=
rts of the start-amadeus ticketing-software were written in SPL. Thus PL-1 =
and its derivates were very high-ranked in the 70ths and 80ths, regarded as=
 the ultimate ratio of the programming languages by many mainframe experts =
in those days.
I mean we are now entering the mainframe horizon, totally different to our =
UNIX and C mini computer, workstation and PC world we all are firm with.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
------------------
PL/I was my favorite mainframe programming language my last two years as

an undergrad. I liked how it incorporated ideas from FORTRAN, ALGOL, and

COBOL. My student job was to enhance a PL/I package for a History professor=
.


As a grad student in 1976, my first job as a TA was to teach PL/I to=20
undergrads. There were a lot of business students in the class. We=20
thought PL/I was likely to be the future of business programming, as a=20
better alternative to COBOL.

I was turned on to V6 UNIX and C in 1977, and I forgot all about PL/I.
