I have to agree with Clem here. I ported multiple device drivers for =
custom boards to DG/UX and it was nicely done at the lower levels.

The documentation was excellent and the field service reps were more =
than helpful when I walked into strange corners that didn=E2=80=99t =
perfectly mesh between SunOS 4.X and DG/UX.
