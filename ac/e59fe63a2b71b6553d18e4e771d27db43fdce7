I've personally thought that Sun should release the source trees of its old 
BSD-based SunOS with the idea of getting back onside with all the Linux and 
Unix people it pissed off by its "buying" a "Unix" license from SCO, the 
Societe Commercial du On-Dit, the Commercial Society of Rumourmongers.

I was also thinking - there's enough free MC68K emulation stuff out there - 
for Mac, Amiga, Atari, etc - that writing a Sun3 emulator should be 
relatively easy.

What do Sun-worshippers ;^) think?
