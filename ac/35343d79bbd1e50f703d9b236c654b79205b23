Well, the subject says "SCO OpenDesktop 386 2.0.0", but what you call
"SCO 2.1" and for which you link updates at ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/UW21/
is UnixWare, which is a very different beast.

SCO OpenDesktop (and SCO OpenServer 5.0.7 that you mention) are SysVR3
based (they are, in fact, the evolution of Microsoft Xenix). Those don't
support at-runtime loadable kernel modules (only at-bootime loadable
kernel modules are supported).

UnixWare, on the other hand, is SysVR4 based, and comes directly from
Novell, who bought it from USL, who bought it from AT&T.

UnixWare 2.1 is the last version of UnixWare before SCO bundled their
"scoadmin" tool with it. UnixWare 2.1.1 also is officially "Unix-95"
certified. UnixWare 2.1 is probably the purest UNIX SysVR4 to be run
on a PC/386, and has very little in common with the archaic SysVR3-based
OpenDesktop/OpenServer releases from SCO.
