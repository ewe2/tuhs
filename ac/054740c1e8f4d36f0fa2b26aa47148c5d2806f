So for the Nth time, there are people who read, I'm one of them,
by looking down the middle of the text and getting the rest through
peripheral vision.  I read easily 3-4x faster than a decently fast reader
and I get enough info that I can find the place where I need to go read
more closely later.

I can't imagine I'm the only person who does this, I'm special but not
that special :)  So for me, wider is optimizing me out, not optimizing
for me.
