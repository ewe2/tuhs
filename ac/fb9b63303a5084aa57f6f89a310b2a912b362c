Decades ago there was an interpreted C in an X10 or X11 app, I believe it
came from the UK.  And maybe it wasn't X11, maybe it was Sunview? 
Whatever it was the author didn't like the bundled scrollbars and had
their own custom made one.

You could set breakpoints like a debugger and then go look around at state.

Does anyone else remember that app and what it was called?
