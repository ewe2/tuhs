It is OK for you Americans.  We ran the GT40 in Scotland about 1974 (2nd =
year undergrad). =20

When the astronaut got out and said =E2=80=9Ca big mac to go=E2=80=9D  =
we had absolutely no idea what he was talking about!
=E2=80=9Ca big mac=E2=80=9D meant nothing and =E2=80=9Cto go=E2=80=9D =
was just bad grammar.  Worse grammar than the split infinitives in star =
trek.

I am sure we did not have a Macdonalds in Scotland at that time.  We did =
have KFC under the uni - many a late-night chew while solving =
programming problems =E2=80=A6.=20
But Macdonalds?  They were well into the 80s=E2=80=A6...

It was years later before any of us actually understood what was being =
said, but yes, a great way to spend debugging hours in the early hours =
of the morning.=20
I can only just remember the use of the light pen - was that for thrust? =
 I have no recollection of any keyboard inputs.
