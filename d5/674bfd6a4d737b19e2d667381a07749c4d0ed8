Any source code for LSX would be archived somewhere within
Nokia Bell Labs?

Yes, as this memo describes, I implemented a very simple version
of large contiguous files and asynchronous file I/O for a special
application. The MERT system developed a little later on, had a
completely integrated of implementation of contiguous files
and asynchronous file I/O.

For a while I have been puzzled by the “serial I/O loop” in use at the labs in the early seventies. Last Fall I found some 1970/1971 BSTJ papers about it, but there it stopped.
Jon Steinhart would have more information about the serial I/O loo.

Weller continued to work on it up to 1973 at least and that it was integrated with Unix in some way. Is that correct? Did the two memo’s referred to (MM 70-1384-1 and TM 73-1356-8) survive?
I do not believe that the software for the Glance terminals was ever
integrated into the standard UNIX software distribution

This appears to show the serial I/O loop in use as late as 1978, with a very intriguing use case involving system call forwarding over the network.
Carl Christensen and I developed this software to handle small
computer systems with disk storage, as described in the memo,
and in the BSTJ article. The satellite diskless computers could be attached
to a powerful central computer by means the serial I/O loop or
various standard DEC controllers. Each of the satellite computers
could run different tailored applications

I think Jon Steinhart has described this elsewhere?
