Leave it to IBM to do something backwards.

Of course, that was in 1954, so I can't complain, it was 11 years before 
I was born. But that's ... odd.

Was subtraction easier than addition with digital electronics back then? 
I would think that they were both the same level of effort (clock 
cycles) so why do something obviously backwards logically?
