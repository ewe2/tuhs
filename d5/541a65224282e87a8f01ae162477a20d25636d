The old school Unix guys are just like this.  I asked BWK about awk and
he tarred up ~bwk/awk and sent me the source to awk, to the awk book,
it was crazy cool.

And it's crazy cool that us "younger" (I feel pretty old but younger
than the Unix guys) folks get to hang out with the people who were 
there at the beginning.  I can't tell you how grateful I am to be on
this list with these people.
