The first Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) keyboard was for the Apple IIgs:

https://deskthority.net/wiki/Apple_Desktop_Bus_Keyboard

and that lead to the same keyboard layout for the Mac II ADB keyboards (the =
Mac 128K, Fat Mac, and Mac Plus did not use ADB for their keyboards):

https://deskthority.net/wiki/Apple_M0116

That was the last Apple keyboard with the Control and Escape keys in the =
correct positions, particularly for those of us using Macs as terminals =
to Unix systems.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Keyboard (a reasonably full history).

I took a typing class in 7th grade (early 1970s) on heavy, manual Smith-Corona =
typewriters, more or less contemporaneously with learning to program in BASIC =
on a DG Nova batch system, using non-punched Hollerith cards - we marked them =
with #2 pencils, and woe is you if you didn't fill in the dots well enough
for your cards to be read by the card reader: correct your cards, and back of =
the batch queue for you!

After that, it was years pounding TTY ASR-33s (interactive BASIC, rather than =
batch), Hazeltine h1500, LSI ADM-3a, Heathkit h19, HP 2621, the occasional =
DEC VT100 or VT102 ... after being hired in July 1988 by Apple, I've typed on =
basically nothing but Apple keyboards, with very occasional flirtations with =
third-party ADB or USB keyboards.

I had a bad bout of repetitive strain injury (specifically, ulnar nerve =
syndrome - a cousin of carpal tunnel syndrome) in my left hand in the early =
1990s, partly from pounding keyboards too hard for too long, and partly (I =
think) from wearing a Casio digital watch with the watchband cinched too tight =
(I hate floppy watch). I made three changes, after a month of PT and silly =
amounts of ibuprofen: velcro watch band/strap for near-infinite fine adjustment =
of fit (so as not to constrict my wrist), neoprene wrist rests in front of my =
keyboards, and training myself not to pound the keys so hard.

I still have a small stock of Apple M0116 keyboards, though I've capitulated =
to the IBM PC "typist" keyboard layout with Control in the incorrect position; =
I've been using the Apple A1243 (US) Aluminum USB extended keyboard (with some =
replacement stock) since its introduction in 2007, and I'm moderately happy =
with it: thin keyboard, no wrist rest required, light touch - no key pounding =
required. The A1843 (optionally wireless USB keyboard with "lightning" port =
and no USB hub) is an OK replacement, but I use it strictly wired. Laptop =
keyboards also want a lighter touch these days.

I'm glad I took the typing course, but I'm hardly a full touch typist. However, =
I'm fast enough that I prefer vi to emacs, as I've previously described. I'm =
not perfect, but that's what the backspace or DEL key is for (and, with a =
properly programmed tty line discipline: ^W (word erase)). Very glad I was =
already conversant with computers when it came time to write essays for UCB =
freshman English classes. That was also impetus to learn nroff.
