You could install FreeBSD 1 and have no UI to ignore. Most of BSD 4.3
compiles under it (though with some hacking iirc) and the difference
in user experience between the 4.3 and 4.4 kernels isn't huge. Going
the other way is harder (running 4.4 in 4.3) since the 4.4 userland
uses a lot of kernel features new in 4.4. It was based on the net2
tape with missing bits filled in.
