Classical sequential files, however, were simply random-access files
such that seeking to line n was just a matter of seeking to byte
n * MAXCHARSLINE.  The last time I actually used such a thing was
on an early Tandem system when I was implementing the Software Tools.
Editable source used a different format, so I set things up so that
the Tools could either read source format or sequential format and
then wrote sequential format.

The theory that a single catastrophic event may have been responsible
has been strengthened by the recent discovery of a worldwide layer of
