Yeah, that's why I suggested it; I did play with it on one those PDT 
thingies some decades ago (just to see if I could; the thing was on loan).

Hadn't heard of FUZIX, but after looking at the web page then I concur; 
I'll keep it in mind should I ever get a tiny machine :-)  I did have a 
fine collections of Microbees (Aussie Z-80 box) once, but they're long 
gone, along with enough bits to make an Applix 1616 (Aussie 68000 box).
