./configure or not, it's damned hard to install large amounts of software
without root.  You can do it, but it's hard, especially if some of it
is really really expensive to build from source, since you're blocked
from using the distro's own install tool.

Most people who use Unix today are the only ones there.  Someone should
really rewrite finger(1) to do something different.

Monday we watch-a Firefly's house, but he no come out.  He wasn't home.
Tuesday we go to the ball game, but he fool us.  He no show up.  Wednesday he
go to the ball game, and we fool him.  We no show up.  Thursday was a
double-header.  Nobody show up.  Friday it rained all day.  There was no ball
game, so we stayed home and we listened to it on-a the radio.  --Chicolini
