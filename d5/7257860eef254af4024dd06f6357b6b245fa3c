it was a mix, $HOME was tied to a specific UID.

for show data we leveraged per-volume quotas.  our directory structure 
was setup in such a way that a a path would be a series of symlinks 
pointing for specific NFS volumes.  so /shot/sequence/render for example 
could reference multiple volumes. /shot/sequence would live on a 
separate filer than "render".  we could also move around where "render" 
would live and not have to worry about creating orphan paths and such.  
this was a common practice to manage hotspots, or for maint windows etc.

the net result was we used a mix of volume quotas that netapp managed in 
addition to higher level shot/show quotas which were calculated out of 
band by some in-house services.
