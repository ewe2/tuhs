We retired gets from Research UNIX back in 1984 or perhaps
earlier, with no serious pain because replacing it wasn't
hard and everybody agreed with the reason.

I'm glad to hear some part of the rest of the world is
catching up.

We also decided to retire the old Enigma-derived crypt(1),
except we didn't want to throw it out entirely in case
someone had an old encrypted file and wanted the contents
back.  So it was removed from the manual and the binary
moved to /usr/games.
