Thanks, all, for that input.

The ddt debugger appears to be a fork of 5th edition cdb. It survived in =
the Interdata 7/32 port:
=
https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3DInterdata732/usr/source/chica=
go
It appears to have originated from Bill Allen at the Naval Postgraduate =
School.


Some more reading appears to show a much more gradual development than I =
first thought. Working along Doug=E2=80=99s list:

- First there was db, which claims to be loosely based on DEC=E2=80=99s =
ODT in its man page. Written in assembler.

- Then there is cdb, a rewrite in C, as from 3rd edition. Judging from =
the man pages, in 3rd and 4th edition it is a mostly incomplete project.

- The first reasonably complete version of cdb appears in 5th edition. =
It only handles =E2=80=9Cnormal=E2=80=9D symbols (see below for =
=E2=80=9Cnormal=E2=80=9D). The ddt debugger forks from this version, =
presumably to fill in some missing features (e.g. access to non-C =
identifiers, single stepping, etc.; I have not done a full feature =
comparison).

- In 6th edition =E2=80=9Cpseudo=E2=80=9D symbols are introduced: =
symbols starting with a tilde that provide names for auto and register =
variables. The cdb debugger is updated to allow references to local =
variables using a =E2=80=9Cprocname:varname=E2=80=9D syntax. The ddt =
debugger picked this up as well. It is a first step towards the stabs =
format.

I would assume that db and cdb are the work of dmr/ken.

- In 7th edition there is the new adb, by Steve Bourne. Main focus of =
adb appears to have been portability more than major new features. =
Again, I have not compared the feature sets of ddt and adb to see if =
there was an influence.

- In 32V the symbol format is changed: (i) the =E2=80=9Ctilde hack=E2=80=9D=
 is replaced by a new assembler pseudo op =E2=80=9C.stabs=E2=80=9D; (ii) =
this is then used to include more pseudo symbols, for line numbers, for =
file names, etc.; (iii) the symbol struct is extended with a field to =
hold the symbol's type. It is essentially stabs, but with 8 char names. =
A new source level debugger, sdb, allows source level debugging. Its =
command language is the first to feel like a gdb ancestor. Author Howard =
Katseff.

The dbx debugger appears to stand on the shoulders of sdb, and gdb on =
the shoulders of dbx.

In 8th edition there are 3 debuggers: adb, sdb and pi (for use with the =
Blit).
