m a UNIX man since the days of Sys4R4. Since then I run Linux and nothing e=

onest I don't like Apple because it's an elitist system: People pay at leas=

was introduced to Unix in the mid 1990's through my wife's VMS account at U=
T Arlington, where they had a portal to the WWW. I was able to download Sla=
ckware with the 0.9 kernel on 11 floppies including X11. I installed this o=
n my system at the time - either a DEC Rainbow 100B? or a handme down gener=
ic PC. A few years later at Western Illinois University - they had some Sun=
 Workstations there and I loved working with them. It would be several year=
s later, though, that I would actually use unix in a work setting - 1998. I=
 don't even remember what brand of unix, but I think it was again, sun, tho=
ugh no gui, so not as much love. Still, I was able to use rcs and and when =
my Windows bound buddies lost a week's work because of some snafu with thei=
r backups, I didn't lose anything - jackflash was the name of the server - =
good memories :). However, after this it was all DOS and Windows until, 200=
5.<br /><br />I'd been eyeing Macs for some time. I like the visual aesthet=
ics and obvious design considerations. But, in 2005, I finally had a bonus =
big enough to actually buy one. I bought a G5 24" iMac and fell in love wit=
h Mac. Next, it was a 15" G4 Powerbook. I loved those Macs until Intel came=
 around and then it was game over, no more PC's in my life (not really, but=
 emotionally, this was how I felt). With Mac going intel, I could dual boot=
 into Windows, Triple boot into Linux, and Quadruple boot into FreeBSD, and=
 I could ditch Fink and finally manage my unix tools properly (arguable, I =
know) with Homebrew or MacPorts (lately, I've gone back to MacPorts due to =
Homebrew's lack of support for older OS versions, and for MacPorts seeming =
rationality).<br /><br />Anyhow, I have thoroughly enjoyed the Mac ride, bu=
t with Catalina, the ride got really bumpy (too much phone home, no more 32=
 bit programs and since Adobe Acrobat X, which I own, outright, isn't 64 bi=
t, among other apps, this just in not an option for me), and with Big Sur, =
it's gotten worse, potholes, sinkholes, and suchlike, and the interface is =
downright patronizing (remember Microsoft Bob?). So, here I am, Mr. Run-Any=
-Cutting-Edge-OS anytime guy, hanging on tooth and nail to Mac OS Mojave wh=
ere I still have a modicum of control over my environment.<br /><br />My th=
ought for the day and question for the group is... It seems that the option=
s for a free operating system (free as in freedom) are becoming ever more l=
imited - Microsoft, this week, announced that their Edge update will remove=
 Edge Legacy and IE while doing the update - nuts; Mac's desktop is turning=
 into IOS - ew, ick; and Linux is wild west meets dictatorship and major co=
rporations are moving in to set their direction (Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, et=
c.). FreeBSD we've beat to death over the last couple of weeks, so I'll lea=
ve it out of the mix for now. What in our unix past speaks to the current c=
ircumstance and what do those of you who lived those events see as possibil=
ities for the next revolution - and, will unix be part of it?<br /><br />An=
d a bonus question, why, oh why, can't we have a contained kernel that prov=
ides minimal functionality (dare I say microkernel), that is securable, and=
 layers above it that other stuff (everything else) can run on with auditin=
g and suchlike for traceability?<br />&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><br =
