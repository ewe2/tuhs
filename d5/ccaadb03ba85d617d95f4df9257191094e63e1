Subject: [TUHS] A Couple of Early Networking Unix System
Message-ID: <20170224042136.GA18159@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, thanks to the hard effort of Noel Chiappa and Paul Ruizendaal,
we now have a couple of early Unix systems with networking modifications.
They can be found in:

   http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Early_Networking/

I'll get them added to the Unix Tree soon.

Cheers, Warren
