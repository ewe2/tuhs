It was a V7 clone (like Minix).  I've forgotten but I thought it originally
ran on 286 (again like Minix).
​But, ​
I'm not sure why it was not as popular.  Maybe the difference was that it
was a V7 clone and closed source as it were
​, while ​
Minix was a tad cheaper and you got the sources.
​  Also it (again like Minix) was floppy based.  By that time AT&T UNIX or
BSD Unix is running on 'JAWS' [just another workstation] those systems
tended to have disks in them and UNIX really need one in practice.   As Ted
points out and I agree (as pointed out by Jolitiz in his DDJ articles, I
was partly responsible for the original BSD/386 hard disk driver)​, the
Linux support for ST506 and ESDI disks was very early and actually pretty
stable in the earliest versions of Linux.   In fact, because I was
familiar
​with the HD stuff from BSD/386 it was one the first things I had
personally checked out and was pleased to see was solid.​

​Not yet - I'll send out an URL when the conference papers all go on line,
but if you privately send me a message I'll send you a PDF.  Note, a couple
of you have an earlier (near final) draft, so send me a note if you want
the printed one.   The differences are minor-> some clarification/some
small rewording to dealing with English colloquialisms that were not
understood by the French. ​
