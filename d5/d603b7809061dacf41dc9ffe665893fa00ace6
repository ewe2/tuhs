Having the original Wollongong Interdata 7/32 might
be interesting to the Computer History museum, though
it might be expensive to transport it across the Pacific.

As for dates: the Wollongong port was essentially
contemporaneous with ours, certainly independent,
and was declared in production sooner (July 1977
vs. spring 1978).  Ours was "in principle"  done by Aug.
1977, theirs by April '77.  Various papers are
gathered at

Greg Rose is definitely still extant.
