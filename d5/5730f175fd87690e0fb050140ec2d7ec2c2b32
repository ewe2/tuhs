I've been aware of them for years, but I've never actually used them for =

hive mind that is TUHS / COFF.

The only time I ever used it was back in the early =E2=80=9890s when on =
a SunOS system (dirac, for friends) it was used to allow graduate =
students access to the grading database (i.e. a text file) which was =
within a directory normally only accessible to teaching staff. The =
directory was group writable to a special =E2=80=9Cmarking group=E2=80=9D =
to which the various graduate students were added each term.

We=E2=80=99d "newgrp grades=E2=80=9D and type the password we had been =
given to be able to edit the file and add the grades for the assessments =
we had marked (for food money).

I eventually became root on the machine and found my =E2=80=9Csu -=E2=80=9C=
 screen to be a faster solution to accessing the file (sorry Franco, =
should you ever read this).

Cheers,
