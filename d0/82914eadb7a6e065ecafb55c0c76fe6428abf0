The VM systems at the UofM ran in local time.     There was no way to set
the time short of rebooting.
In the fall they'd announce.   System going down for reboot at 0130.   Back
up at 0100.

Amtrak has an amusing way of handling the time change.   A train just never
departs before it's published time.    This means in the spring; the trains
just tend to run an hour late (or later than normal).
In the fall, the train sits at whatever station it had arrived at before 2
AM and waits until the clock catches up.
