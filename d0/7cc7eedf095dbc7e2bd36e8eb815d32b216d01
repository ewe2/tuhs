Yes, there is also incidental complexity required by the need for
various pre-existing factors.

I doubt if the program is really just 4K any more, and there are such
things as shared libraries.  The Asian width table is not very big
by itself, especially if you use runs of characters rather than individual
characters and do a binary search.

See <http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html> (slow to load)
and examine the fourth column ("Chart") for rows 1063-65.  Basically,
GREEN BOOK has vertical stripes on the cover, BLUE BOOK has horizontal
stripes, and ORANGE BOOK is black with white dots.

1-1 convertibility with various Japanese character sets.  Unicode is
not Cleanicode: it was designed not to do the best possible job, but
the best job possible under the circumstances.
