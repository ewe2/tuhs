Gad, that triggers memories.  There was a program on our GE mainframe that
output LF/CR instead of CR/LF.  The terminal driver would do the linefeed
and then laboriously space out until it was under the previous cursor
position, and then do the CR.  Great for raising your blood pressure and
stimulating streams of nasty invective against GE.
