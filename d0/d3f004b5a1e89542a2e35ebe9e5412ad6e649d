Perhaps there is someone here who remembers this better than I do, but in the UK there were some fairly seriously heroic things that had to be done because we had the wrong order for names, and there were then all sorts of really exciting ambiguities resulting from that (what did "cs.x.edu" mean?).  May be another tool would have been better than sendmail, but whatever it was would have been pretty hairy.
