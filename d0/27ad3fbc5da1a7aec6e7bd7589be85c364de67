If you are into 386BSD there is also
https://github.com/386bsd/386bsd

It has sources for the pre Net/2 release. This was
originally a floppy sized set of patches against BSD.

386BSD 1.0 sources. The full distribution was
released as CD-ROM together with a lot of
documentation. I dumped it at
https://github.com/dugoh/386bsdcd if you care
to boot it up.

386BSD 2.0 sources, I think this was released
as an update disk originally and put online
this summer by the Jolitzes.

Warning on 1.0 and 2.0, the copyright notice is
not compatible with BSD.

I had a lot of fun running 0.1 with patch kits.
http://gunkies.org/wiki/Installing_386BSD_on_BOCHS

An attempt to automate that guide with the help of
Travis stranded due to maximum build times, but
Moore will catch up one day.
