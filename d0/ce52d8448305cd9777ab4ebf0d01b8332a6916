Good point!

Checking the sccs -R log output from the CSRG archives of course at the bottom
gives something like: 

Wed Apr  9 16:02:50 1980 bill
        * ./sys/kern/kern_resource.c 3.1
          date and time created 80/04/09 16:02:50 by bill

Wed Apr  9 16:02:48 1980 bill
        * ./sys/vax/vax/Locore.c 3.1
          date and time created 80/04/09 16:02:48 by bill

Tue Dec  4 15:58:14 1979 bostic
        * ./usr.bin/ctags/ctags.c 4.1
          3bsd version


and we need to know that "bostic" is the login from Keith Bostic and "bill" is 
the login from Bill Joy.

I am not sure whether there ever was something like user at domain in version 
control before BitKeeper SCCS has been introduced.

BTW: the introduction of SCCS was early, at that time I had no access to more 
than a desktop calculator.
