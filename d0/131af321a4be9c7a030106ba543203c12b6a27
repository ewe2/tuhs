i was a TA for the course which used this as a textbook.
my memory is little faded on this (it was on the other side of my =
stroke),
but i believe they were perfect bound (cloth strip and glue) and had
two different colors for the covers (i want to say orange and red).
they might have been just stapled but they were thick enough that =
staples
might have been insufficient.

i certainly remember john printing them off on the DEC printer.

as for the permissions, i can=E2=80=99t recall anything at the time =
(this was about 45 years ago),
but do remember the fuss at the Labs when Bell Labs started printing =
their own
high security copies just a couple of years later.
