I definitely had man pages on my 3B2/400 with SysVr3 (and r3.2).

They were pre-formatted (catman), not troff source though, IIRC.

This was true for all of UNIX System V, at least from 2.0 on.

There was a separate "source" distribution for the documentation, called
the "Machine Readable Documentation", aka MRD.  It contains source for
all of the system documentation, not just the manual pages.

The separation was necessary due to the separate licensing of the
Documenter's Workbench.  You couldn't format roff documents without it,
not even with nroff, so source for the documentation would be useless to
anyone who didn't also license DWB.  (IIRC some Unix licensees kept
their versions of V7 nroff working on their later SysV releases so that
they could ship man page sources that would be usable, but using that
ancient troff with modern printers was painful even with Chris Lewis'
psroff.)

The archive.org copy of SysVr2.0-NS32k contains source for DWB, MRD, as
well as the system and commands:

https://archive.org/download/ATTUNIXSystemVRelease4Version2/SysVr2.0_32000.tgz

I don't know if it is legal or not, but it's been there for ages.

IIRC somewhere there on archive.org there's also a SysVr2 for VAX too,
complete with binaries and sources, and it has catman pages included.

I do happen to have a copy of the MRD for SysVr3.2 for 3B2, but I don't
think it is legal.  I also had a legal binary license for DWB-2.0 for
3B2, but I don't think I have a copy of the media any more.
