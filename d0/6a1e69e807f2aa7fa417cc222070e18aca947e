Line up all the (ir)responsible programmers against a wall?  Computer 
programming is the only discipline I've seen where no formal 
qualifications are required; any idiot can call themselves a "programmer" 
if they've barely learned how to write in BASIC...

Yes, I have a BSc majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics (both pure 
and applied), so I guess I'm a bit elitist :-)
