No, such a Pascal would've been more of an Ada if developed like C++; more of an Oberon or Modula-2 
if minimalist.

I (officially) learned programming with Turbo Pascal. However, I'd already read both Comer's and 
Tanenbaum's books on operating system design and implementation, and likewise Brinch Hansen's 
book on Solo and Concurrent Pascal.

It didn't take long to work out that you could put together larger projects even with Turbo C than you 
could with Turbo Pascal, and the Turbo Pascal efforts towards handling large projects were a fudge.

I liked Oberon - I think Wirth came closer to the minimalism of C with Oberon.
