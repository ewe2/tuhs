 From what I remember, the 750 will run off single-phase 110 volt. So 
will an RM05, but it has to be 220 (which, in the US, requires two 
phases to make 220).

I think only the RP06/7's really needed 3-phase, but even then, I could 
be wrong. Most of this DEC equipment really only needed single-phase, 
but balancing the load was always a good idea in places that were 
already 3-phase capable.
