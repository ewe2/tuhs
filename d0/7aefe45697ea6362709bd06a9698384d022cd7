No,
On the first floor there used to be (could still be there but it was a while ago) a room concerning computing.  In there was a wing, with the skin removed to show the structure, of a Henschel anti-ship missile.  These were dropped by bombers and then guided in by radio.  This was labeled up AFAIR as being manufactured by a primitive CNC system.  Looking at the various web pages from Zuse's writings he produced a measurement system for these so that they could be produced using low tech machining.
