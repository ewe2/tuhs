Hi Dave,

I use that too;  it picks up GB from one's locale.

    $ aspell config | grep _
    # default: <language-tag> = en_GB
    # default: <lang> = en_GB
    # default: .aspell.<lang>.pws = .aspell.en_GB.pws
    # default: .aspell.<lang>.prepl = .aspell.en_GB.prepl
    $

In the past, I've fed corrections back to aspell's author as bug
reports, typically with a link to
https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/panelling and they get into
a new release every now and again.  He's moved to github, I see.
