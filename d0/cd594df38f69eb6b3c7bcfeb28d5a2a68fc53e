One note for those who've been away from 4.x for a while...

If you're using a console window for editing and you just wonder why the 
full screen of the VT100 doesn't show up -- it's because the getty is 
set down at 1200 baud for the good old LA120 DECwriter III.

Set /etc/ttys to 18console or 12console and it's expects 9600baud and 
then vi will let you use full screen to edit.

Been a while since I ran a fake Vax under Unix.
