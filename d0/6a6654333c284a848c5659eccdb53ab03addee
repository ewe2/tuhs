se(1) is in my UNIX 5.0 manual, which was the internal version of System 
V release 1. It makes sense that it would be the one Andrew wrote.

My recollection is that se was the result of Not Invented Here. There 
was lots of demand for vi in the internal USG version of UNIX, and it 
was present in exptools, but not the official distribution of UNIX. 
(Lots of demand for emacs, too, also in exptools.) Rather than adopt one 
of them, se was written. I think it appeared about UNIX 4.2.

My UNIX 5.0 manual also has vi(1). Once vi was installed, demand for se 
went away. I'm not sure when it was dropped, but it's not in my SVID.
