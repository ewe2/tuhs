I'm not familiar with the tty driver in late versions of Unix like 4.1 (sic),
but I'm very familiar with the one in V6, and it's not the raw mode _itself_
that caused the load (the code paths in the kernel for cooked and raw aren't
that different), but rather the need to wake up and run a process on every
character that was the real load.

When Bernie Greenberg did EMACS for Multics, he had a similar issue. I recall
reading a document with an extensive discussion of how they dealt with this,
especially when using the system over the ARPANET. IIRC, normal printing
characters were echoed without waking up the process; remotely, when using
the network. If anyone's really interested in this, and can't find it themselves,
I can try looking for it.
