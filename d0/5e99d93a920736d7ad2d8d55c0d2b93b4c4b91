Actually, how common was that?  I know at SGI we did that with O_DIRECT
on files (and just automatically on the way for in networking and page
flipped on the way out).  But it was a pile of work, you had to lock
all the pages so that the pageout daemon didn't page them out, etc.

So under what circumstances would Unix do DMA to/from user buffers
rather than bcopy it?
