If only this were true.  Until reasonably recently (may be a couple of years ago was the last time I cared), a major Unix vendor's recommendation was not to have separate /var, because that was "old fashioned" (I assume).  Some of their installation / upgrade programs would fail if you did in fact.  For additional amusement, the default install would put no limit on the size of the memory-based /tmp filesystem.  So basically anything on the system could fill / with all the undesirable consequences that has, and also eat the system's memory in an unpleasantly persistent way.
