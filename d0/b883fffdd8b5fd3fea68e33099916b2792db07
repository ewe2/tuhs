I heard about this second hand, so anyone with first hand knowledge should
feel free to correct me.

When AT&T took an ill-fated plunge into chip manufacture, our chips were on
the large side. Dennis noted that "When Intel spoils a wafer, they turn the
chips into tie-tacks. When we spoil a wafer, we turn the chips into belt
buckles". This so infuriated the VP in charge of manufacture that he wanted
"this dmr guy" fired. Needless to say, that didn't happen.
