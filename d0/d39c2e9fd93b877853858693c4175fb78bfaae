Plan 9 can't move directories with mv. I will only change the name of them.
(If this is the question. I was only half paying attention to the thread. S=
orry)

	--bwc

cessna% mkdir dira
cessna% mkdir dirb
cessna% touch dira/a
cessna% touch dirb/b
cessna% mv dira dirb
mv: can't remove ./dirb: remove -- directory not empty

To move contents of directories we use dircp.

cessna% man dircp

     TAR(1)                                                     TAR(1)

     NAME
          tar, dircp - archiver

     SYNOPSIS
          tar key [ file ... ]

          dircp fromdir todir

     DESCRIPTION
          Tar saves and restores file trees.  It is most often used to
          transport a tree of files from one system to another.  The

 	...
               and .tz.  If no extension matches, gzip is used.  The z
               flag is unnecessary (but allowed) when using the t and
               x verbs on archives with recognized extensions.

     EXAMPLES
          Tar can be used to copy hierarchies thus:

               @{cd fromdir && tar c .} | @{cd todir && tar xT}

          Dircp does this.

     SOURCE
          /sys/src/cmd/tar.c
          /rc/bin/dircp

     SEE ALSO
          ar(1), bundle(1), tapefs(4), mkfs(8)
