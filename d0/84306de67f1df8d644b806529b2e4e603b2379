Subject: [TUHS] Excessive bouncing ... argh!
Message-ID: <20170921223420.GA27231@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, overnight the mail list blocked about 60 people because of excessive
bouncing. It was probably because the list has been busy, and the bounce
threshold for the (mostly gmail) addresses was exceeded. I've manually
re-enabled them all.

I have installed the script that strips DKIM and ARC header lines before
the list software processes the inbound e-mails. We will see if that helps.

Apologies, Warren
