SCO got Lachman's TCP/IP stack (that they bought from Convergent) just
after this timeframe.  I know because I did the port.  Also open sourced
a sw (STREAMS watch) program I wrote so you could tune the kernel (kernel
defaults yielded horrible performance).  I still have that code if anyone
cares, can't imagine it is interesting.
