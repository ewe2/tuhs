I used this code when I worked at 6200 Broad St. in Reynoldsburg.
Someone hooked it into the web browsers at the time which would have
been Mosaic.  At some point I got a hold of the client side code and I
"ported" it to NetBSD so I could use utilities when I was dialed back
into the company.  I think I hooked it into ssh at one point, but it has
been a long time, and I don't exactly remember.  I know I hooked in the
NetBSD ftp and telnet clients.

I do know that at 6200, and probably company wide, this whole scheme was
replaced by filtering firewalls of some ilk and the proxy gateway was
done away with.  That would have been early 2000s or so, assuming my
memory is not faulty.
