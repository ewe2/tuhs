I'm playing with the idea of hooking up a modem to my wireline phone. 
I'd like to keep an eye on my late mother-in-law's place remotely. Best 
I can get out there is DSL, and it ain't snappy, so one idea is to get 
two Telebit Trailblazer modems, one here, one out there, dial into the 
place, pull imagery via UUCP. Trailies spoof UUCP natively, and they 
deal nicely with bad connectivity. One could take that one step further 
and bring back a bit of Usenet.
