Hi Arnold,

I agree the original Software Tools is a must read, but having done so,
why would I suffer working through the hurdles put in place by Pascal
compared to Ratfor?  I never bothered so your recommendation makes me
wonder what I missed.  I did read Kernighan's ‘not my favourite’
and took from that I wouldn't enjoy the Pascal book given I'd read
the original.

Cheers, Ralph.
