As I understand it, the old hosts.txt registrations got grandfathered into
the DNS in the .arpa zone - they were ARPANET hosts (e.g. see RFC 921).
The modern structure was set up after the transition to IP, so it's fair
to call .com and friends Internet domains. (See RFC 920.)

But it looks like there were a bunch of .edu and .gov names before
Symbolics.
