Well, the bad news it it appears I forgot that at one time no the
distnat past TTL was set to some very low number.  If you are more
than a couple hops away from the University of Scranton you won't
be able to get in yet.

However, good news on two fronts.  I have put up the sources and
if I have the time I will try to find the offending bit this weekend.
(Anybody who remembers fixing this in any Ultrix-11 or Ultrix-32
when it happened originaly feel free to save me the trouble of
searching through the source.)  the other good news is I may be 
acquiring an 11/93 shortly.  If I do and it actually still works
(one never knows inthese acquisitions) I will probably be putting
Ultrix-11 on it and building a Split I&D system.  That will then
become the system I will put on the Net to play with.

Hsve a nice weekend, all.
