Dr. McIlroy,

Much thanks for this!  If you don't object, I will add this note to the
repo as it provides insight into the wherefores of the package.

At this point, I must also give credit where credit is due:

* Chet Ramey, who suggested that I ask Russ Cox to take a look at the package,
* Russ Cox, who fixed the major problems and got all the tests to pass,
* Rares Aioanei, who volunteered to tackle fixing things but did not get
  to do so before Russ beat him to it.

As implied by the above, the package is now up-to-date and functional!
I hope it's of interest to the broader community.

My own reason for seeking this out is that I have (likely vain) hopes
of one day finding a better regex package to use for gawk.  But
regular expressions are interesting in their own right. Russ Cox has
a series of papers on his web site about them that are worth reading.

Finally, thanks again to Dr. McIlroy for humoring me and giving me
his code to play with.

Arnold
