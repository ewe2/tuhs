Hoi,

thanks for your replies, Doug and Ken.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to find the ``Multics Condensed Guide''
on multicians.org. Can someone please provide a link?


Interrestingly, I discovered that qed had double quotes (") as a
comment command, which simply ignores the rest of the line. As far
as I know, there's no way to comment ed scripts. Why was that
dropped?

In ex(1) the " comment command reappeared. I've always wondered
why it used this character for comments. Seems it comes from qed,
leaping over ed, but reappearing in ex.
