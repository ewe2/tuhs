Subject: [TUHS] Questions regarding early Unix contributors
Message-ID: <CMM.0.95.0.1443808808.beebe@gamma.math.utah.edu>

Recent traffic on the TUHS list has discussed early publications about
UNIX at DECUS.

The Digital Technical Journal of Digital Equipment Corporation began
publishing in August 1985, and there is a nearly complete bibliography
at

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/dectechj.bib

Change .bib to .html for a version with live hyperlinks.

The first publication there that mentions ULTRIX in its title is from
March 1986.  Unix appears in a title first in Spring 1995.

The document collection at

	http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/decus/ 

doesn't appear to have much that might be related to Unix ports to DEC
hardware.

The Hewlett-Packard Journal is documented in

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/hpj.bib

The first paper recorded there that mentions Unix or HP-UX is
from March 1984.

The Intel Technical Journal is covered in those archives as well at

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/intel-tech-j.bib

but it only began relatively recently, in 1997.

The IBM Systems Journal began in 1962, and the IBM Journal of Research
and Development in 1957, and both are in those archives at

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/ibmsysj.bib
	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/ibmjrd.bib

In the Systems Journal, the first mention of Unix or AIX is in Fall
1979 (Unix) and then December 1987 (AIX).  In the Journal of R&D, AIX
appears in January 1990, and Unix appears in abstracts sporadically,
but is in a title first in late Fall 2002.

In the Bell Systems Technical Journal, covered at

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/bstj1970.bib
	
(and other decades from 1920 to 2010), the first mention of Unix in a
title is July/August 1978.

There may have been similar corporate technology journals at other
computer companies, such as CDC, Cray, Data General, English Electric,
Ferranti, Gould, Harris, NCR, Pr1me, Univac, Wang, and others, but
I've so far made no attempt to track them down and add bibliographic
coverage.  Suggestions are welcome!
