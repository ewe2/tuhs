This is great feedback, and the shar mechanism would seem applicable 
here too.  But I can't seem to find a date for shar.

I'm under the impression that shar came later in the 1980s. Google's 
archive for net.sources only goes back to 1987 (unless I'm doing it 
wrong) and clearly shar was already well established by then.

Can anyone put a date on shar, or at least before/after 6/1/1980?

Thanks!
