My high school had some computer, don't remember what, may have been a
PDP 11.  The *only* terminal was a line printer, probably a DECwriter,
don't remember.  I do remember it being about 130 columns.

I don't remember if it was the real ed or a clone, but the editor was
very similar to ed(1).  And yes, it's the only way to go with a printer
console.
