So there is currently a *single* volunteer supporting the 32-bit i386
platform for Debian, and in December 2020 there was an e-mail thread
asking whether there were volunteer resources to be able to provide
the necessary support (testing installers, building and testing
packages for security updates, etc.) for the 3.5 years of stable
support.  I don't believe the final decision has been made, but if
more people were willing to volunteer to make it happen, or to pay $$$
to provide that support, I'm sure Debian would be very happy to keep
i386 on life support for the next stable release.

Ultimately, it's all about what people are willing to support by
providing direct volunteer support, or by putting the money where
their mouth is.  "We have met the enemy, and he is us."
