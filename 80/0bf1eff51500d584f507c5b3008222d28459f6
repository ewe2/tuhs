I also like how X will allow me to have windows from remote programs 
mixed with local programs and does not require a full desktop.  (A 
feature that RDP has gotten in the last 10 ? years.)

I completely agree.

Sadly my use case what proving to a ... questionable DBA that things 
could work as directed, despite his objections the other way.

Since I was not familiar with Oracle RAC and Oracle DB, I needed to go 
the front door route, taking screen shots and documenting each and 
everything I did.  (Partially for political reasons.)

Yes, you do need an installed (base) OS with some dependencies. 
Thankfully you don't need a full window manager or the bloat that comes 
with things like Gnome / KDE.

"voxel"?  I'll have to look that up.

I expect that they should be included in such discussions.  After all, 
they are intimately related.  GUI applications are of questionable value 
if you can't interact with them.
