Hi,

On the subject of Troff, this package seems to have disappeared:

	floâ€”A Language for Typesetting Flowcharts
	Anthony P. Wolfman and Daniel M. Berry
	Computer Science, Technion, Haifa 32000, ISRAEL
	1989

The paper about it is available but the code has gone.

Anyone have an archive of it?

-Steve
