Subject: [TUHS] Franz Lisp platforms
Message-ID: <3E8C2C41.4610.94D49@localhost>

while trying to build Franz Lisp (from 4.3 BSD) on VAX/ULTRIX 4.5,
I noticed its peculiar list of supported platforms:

use: lispconf type
  where type is one of
  vax_4_1 vax_4_1a vax_4_1c vax_4_2 vax_4_3
  vax_eunice_vms
  sun_4_1c sun_unisoft dual_unisoft pixel_unisoft
  sun_4_2beta lisa_unisys3 mc500_2_0

I was especially surprised by "lisa_unisys3".  is that Unisoft SysIII
for the Apple Lisa?!  and does anyone know what
{dual,pixel}_unisoft and mc500_2_0 mean?
