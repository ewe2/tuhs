Comparison results: most files diff fine except for a trailing blank line
here and there. Warren is missing as21.s; Doug's as24.s has a few leftover
lines which can be removed.

I will start checking the files into the subversion repository, using the
source layout from 5th Edition. I will also diff against 5th Edition where
possible to determine which way to deal with the trailing blank lines.

Cheers,
