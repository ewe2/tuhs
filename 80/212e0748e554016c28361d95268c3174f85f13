Yes. I saw the same, such as 3.6 to 4.1 (nothing between):

-char   version[] = "VM/UNIX (Berkeley Version %I%) %H% \n";
+char   version[] = "VM/UNIX (Berkeley Version %I%) %G% \n";
 
3.6     char    version[] = "VM/UNIX (Berkeley Version 3.34) 08/31/11 \n";
(That is today's date per %H%.)

4.1     char    version[] = "VM/UNIX (Berkeley Version 4.1) 11/10/80 \n";

But search for "stamp for 4bsd" for example.  This happened from:

D 4.1 80/11/09 16:29:06 bill 5 4        00000/00000/00094
 to
D 4.1 80/11/09 17:02:39 bill 2 1        00000/00000/00016

The previous sccs timestamps are from:

D 3.2 80/06/07 02:45:12 bill 2 1        00001/00001/00044
  to
D 3.29 80/11/09 16:07:34 bill 29 28     00015/00086/00749

This seems to imply that the concept of 4.0 never existed in the source 
tree.  Then again, as far as I see, the SCCS didn't support or use .0 as 
a revision.

This still doesn't explain why all the source files other than libpc are 
same from 4.0bsd and 4.1bsd in the archives.

(I had noticed this same problem a year ago at least.)

If someone has their own 4.0BSD archive please check if different.
