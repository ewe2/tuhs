	It might be necessary to use the '-s' option .   "fsck -s" will
	unconditionally rebuild the freelist.

	The boot block, /boot, /unix, /netnix and /etc/init, /bin/sh are 
	intact since the system got as far as printing the memory numbers.

	After the memory stats the '/etc/autoconfig' process should be
	run ('init' runs it) and the device probes should take place.

	The only thing I can think of (and it's a wild guess) is that the
	"clock" isn't running - thru the boot process clock interrupts 
	aren't used but when 'init' goes to run 'autoconfig' the system nees
	clock interrupts in order to drive the context switching.   Either
	the clock isn't running or /etc/autoconfig got corrupted somehow
	in the copying.
