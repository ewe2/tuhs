Possibly there is a cache for free block numbers
located in the superblock? This is at least in V7
the reason for the limited number of free block
numbers contained in free blocks: if the cache
is to be refilled, the contents of a whole free
block must go into the cache, and this of course
cannot span a whole block, because its size is
only a fraction of the superblock's size.
