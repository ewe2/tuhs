In a paper we will present at this year's International Conference on 
Software Engineering we show (among other things) that the mean length 
of identifiers in Unix C source code has risen from 3.5 to 7.5 
characters from 1973 until today. We also observed a corresponding rise 
in the length of lines and files. Better terminals can be one reason for 
this rise. Other possible reasons may be increased software complexity 
as well as CPU power and memory that allowed the processing of more 
verbose code.

I've uploaded a preprint at
