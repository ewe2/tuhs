Subject: [TUHS] TROFF made trivial
Message-ID: <87ine4haxg.fsf@gmail.com>

Hi,

I found this paper by bwk referenced in the Unix manpages,
in v4 as: TROFF Made Trivial (unpublished),
in v5 as: TROFF Made Trivial (internal memorandom),
also in the v6 "Unix Reading List",
but not anymore in v7.

Anyone have a copy or a scan?
