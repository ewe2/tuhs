Subject: [pups] MSCP Initialization
Message-ID: <3C9A8749.AA90F74A@nktelco.net>

I am trying to get a KFQSA to work with 2.11BSD on a pdp-11. It always 
fails with an error in the SA register during the transition between 
STEP 3 and STEP 4 of the initialization sequence.

The SA register ends up with the value 101513. The error bit is set and 
I think that the rest is an error code. I can't find a reference to 
describe these error codes. 

An RQDX3 and a CQD-223 in the same machine initialize fine. The KFQSA 
initializes in an MVIII using NetBSD 1.5.

I have looked over the initialization code from NetBSD, Ultrix-32, 
4.4BSD, Ultrix-11, and 2.11BSD. The values being sent, are all very 
similar. One difference is that the VAXen OS use polling during the 
init, and the pdp-11 code uses interrupts.

Any suggestions or comments about the MSCP 4 step init and how it works 
on the KFQSA?

A pointer to error code reference would be great too.
