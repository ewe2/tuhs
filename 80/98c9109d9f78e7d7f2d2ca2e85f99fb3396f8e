Aha. OK. That is a different story.

I usualy put comms after the CPU, then network, tape (or tape, network,
what fits best for the wiring) and disks last.

Ahhhhh! My PDP 11 has this M8192 board with FPU but without ROMs...
I thought that this is the "original" 11/73 CPU. But on this PDP is
nothing "original". The BA23 was a MV II, the CPU was EPayed, the RAM
board was given to me by a friend. (Many PC/XTs had to donate there RAM
chips to fill it.) I found the console SLU at the scrap yard, the Dilog
ESDI controller was EPayd (in England BTW ;-) ) ... and I am still
looking for a ROM card... But I will get a /83 CPU card with ROMs in a
few months...

I know. I once saw a MV II with a second RD54 in an external case. There
was a real mess of wiring to get it and the internal RD54 work together
on one RQDX3. Puting the TK50 out of the BA23 and mounting the second
RD54 in the BA23 would have been much simpler. But not the DEC way of
live. ;-)

I know. My MV III lives in a BA123. (With 4 ESDI disks, TK50 and
floppy.)
