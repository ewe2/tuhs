This didn't work either.

No, tar. I tried again with dump and restor and now it works! Thanks
for the hint! I seldomly use dump/restore.

Now there's enough space in /:

$ df
Filesystem  1K-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/xp0a        7816     2658     5158    04%    /
/dev/xp0g      151625   117599    34026    08%    /usr
$ 

Btw, the capacity values look a bit strange?

regards,
chris
