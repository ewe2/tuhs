Time delay for physical movement of the print head is the main reason that
termcap has entries for the number of NUL characters to insert after
carriage return. Not sure it is for the ASR 33, but when it takes a while
for the carriage to return to column 1, you have to insert NULs to wait for
it to be ready to print characters. If it takes 100ms to do the return,
that's still 10 characters of NUL needed...
