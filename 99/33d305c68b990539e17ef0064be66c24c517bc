With the caveat that I must acknowledge that I've been guilty of wandering
off topic more often than I should, it occurs to me that when discussing
the history of something, very often the histories of other things
necessarily feed into that history and become intertwined and inseparable.
There was a lot of "stuff" happening in the computer industry at the time
Unix was created, in it's early years, and on in its (continuing)
evolution, and that "stuff" surely impacted Unix in one way or another. If
we really want to understand where Unix came from and why it is, we must
open ourselves to understanding those influences as well.

That said, of course, there's a balance. Having a place one could point to
and respectfully say, "Hey, this has gone on for 50+ messages; could you
move it over to off-tuhs?" might be useful for folks who want to deep-dive
on something.

We wandered into Linux/ext2 with Ted, that was fun.

Indeed. I'll go further and confess that I use TUHS as a learning resource
that influences by work professionally. There's a lot of good information
that comes across this list that gets filed away in my brain and manifests
itself in surprising ways by informing my work. I selfishly want that to
continue.
