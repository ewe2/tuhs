A slash has long been used to separate items in a hierarchy, e.g.
division, department, staff initials, or account, purchase-order number,
at least back to the early twentieth century.  So choosing it might have
seemed natural.

And Multics had some kind of `attach' and `detach' of I/O streams, well
known to Ossanna, so perhaps dup(2), and a Thompson-shell syntax to go
with it meant `>' was earmarked early on.
