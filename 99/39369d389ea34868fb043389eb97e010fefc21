I couldn't have said it better. I was looking at 'man syscalls' and 
shaking my head just a couple of days ago. I also just thought, hey, 
wouldn't it be nice to get a printed copy of the latest manpages - uh, 
that ain't gonna happen - 3000+ manpages, sheesh. Not sure I was 
thinking 'man widget_toolbar' would provide me with any deep insights 
anyway, maybe that's why its in mann.

How many of roughly 500 system calls (to say nothing of uncounted
ioctl's) do you think are necessary for writing those few crucial
capabilities that distinguish Linux from v7? There is
undeniably bloat, but only a sliver of it contributes to the
distinctive utility of today's systems.

Or consider this. Unix grew by about 39 system calls in its first
decade, but an average of 40
per decade ever since. Is this accelerated growth more symptomatic of
maturity or of cancer?
