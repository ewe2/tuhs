Subject: [pups] PDP-11 hardware & software usage poll
Message-ID: <7AD18F04B62B7440BE22E190A3F7721409DFEE@mwsrv04.microwalt.nl>

Hi All,

For those of you who don't follow alt.sys.pdp11: I set up
a simple web page to start an inventory poll on the number
and types of PDP-11 systems used by hobbyists, the operating
systems in use on them, and what, if any, licenses are being
used for those systems.

All this has to do with the whole Mentec not having a license
program for the PDP-11 R* operaing systems (RT, RSX and RSTS).

After some discussion with Mentec, the site was set up to do
the gathering of numbers so we can convince their Management
that there are many systems in hobby use, and that there's
enough people willing to aquire such a license.

Please check out

        http://www.pdp11.nl/poll.htm

and do your magic.  None of the information provided will be
transferred to anyone- only the summarized info will be made
available in a report to Mentec - a copy of which you can
request by requesting the 'feedbeck' stuff in the poll.

Thanks, and spread the word !

Fred
