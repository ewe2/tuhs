Unlike BeOS, FreeBSD is multiuser, and supports the concept of
credentials.  I was asked to do some work porting some things,
including NFS, SMB, NetWare, and filesystem support to BeOS,
but it has an intrinsic lack of a security model, which can not
be easily overcome.  It is not suitable as a server OS.

Any suggestions as to where I can get my hands on boot ROM's (or
data files. I have access to an EPROM programmer) for use with an 11/73? 
A boot-ROM Qbus card would be nice too..

I'm trying to build up a new 11/73 (heh.. 'new' ;-) with an ex-uVAX BA213 
chassis.  (the original KA650 is in storage as a spare for my running machine)

I have most of the stuff I need (anybody have a spare 4 Mbyte QBUS card??) and
can re-use most of the QBUS cards from the uVAX (with an Emulex UC07
SCSI card! yeah!), but I don't have any boot ROM's or a ROM-card 
for the 11/73. 

The CPU card is a dual-wide version, so no on-board ROM's :-(

So far my searches have turned up little or nothing in this area, but I
hope that the combined brain-power here knows some addresses I can
try..

Thanx!

								Bye, Arno,

[Later comment indicates a KDJ11-A...]

If you don't mind a toggle-in (err, um, ODT-in) bootstrap, you can
find a selection (some of them with disassemblies) at

 http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/academic/computer-science/history/pdp-11/

just click on "Bootstraps".  If you really insist on rolling your
own from scratch, you can burn these (modified if you want) into your
own EPROM's.

Chances are that if you find a Q-bus card that takes EPROM's it will
already have a boot ROM in it.  For more on what's out there, read
Micronote #3 "Compatible Bootstraps for the LSI-11/73" and Micronote #15
"Q-Bus Hardware Bootstraps".  If you don't have a printed set of
Micronotes handy, you can click on the above link at metalab and
then click on the Micronote index.

The UC07 has an onboard PDP-11 bootstrap you can enable.  Why not just
turn it on?
