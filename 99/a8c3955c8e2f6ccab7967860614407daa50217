See the blurb for the UNSW 01 image here:
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/UNSW

UNSW 01
-------
	Tape label: System Source Disk
		    DD format URK? BS=24B count=203 800bpi 9track
		    UNIX System Source 1 of 1
		    25/1/78

A distribution of UNIX source from UNSW, with several changes. record0.gz is
an RK05 image laid out according to the `Boston Children's Museum' format
(i-nodes in the middle). Latest file timestamp is Jan 24 1978. There is only
kernel source, plus a `unswbatch' directory. The latter seems to hold the
source to a UNIX batch system developed by Ian Johnstone and other at the
School of Electrical Engineering at UNSW.

record0.tar.gz is a tar archive of the RK05 image.

Cheers, Warren
