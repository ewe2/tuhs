that BBN (Gurwitz) did the original IP/TCP support (sans sockets - i.e. =
/dev/ip /dev/tcp ...).  Your date of June '81 for the 4.1BSD release =
seems late, but I'll accept it.  3BSD was 1979, and I thought 4BSD was a =
year later, with 4.1BSD a few months after 4BSD (few people actually got =
4BSD)

I am aware of that. =E2=80=9C20 years of Berkely Unix=E2=80=9D says =
November 1980 for 4BSD and June 1981 for 4.1BSD. =46rom the SCCS log =
I=E2=80=99d say November 9th and July 1st respectively.

As far as I can tell CSRG integrated the BBN stack with (almost) 4.1 in =
April 1981 - most of that is in a separate tree, with a few #ifdef=E2=80=99=
s in the main tree. =46rom SCCS it seems that implementation work on =
sockets started in Oct/Nov 1981 and 4.1a was released in April or March =
1982. =46rom the partial coverage in SCCS I=E2=80=99d say there is no =
BBN code in 4.1a anymore. The socket API in that release was different =
from what ended being in 4.1c and 4.2, and seems to have had some wider =
visibility in 2.9BSD and UniPlus System V - both of which used the 4.1a =
API (and probably code base).

> That said, Bill and Sam did the heavy lifting on select(2) first in =
4.1aBSD and there were some issues (again I have forgotten the details =
-- I do remember, I was working on my thesis and I had a do a huge =
rewrite of the AP kernel support to handle select(2) properly).  I =
remember talking to Sam (arguing with him most probably) about it one =
night before it was fully created.   I want to say, he had worked on =
something similar at the firm he was at (the firm name I now forget -- =
si-mumble -- they were in Mt. View) before he joined CRSG.  I don't =
remember now the issues I had, but I do remember it was a bit of mess to =
support the way the AP hardware assumed it could do DMA on the UBA[2]

ARPA-sites, although I would have expected someone like Dennis in 1127 =
to have been sent it also, as wnj was in the process of leaving for Sun =
and he took them with him.  For instance, I would take 4.1c to Masscomp. =
 The key is that these were not as widely distributed as 4.1BSD.   =
4.2BSD would really accelerate BSD UNIX uptake, because of the =
networking support but there was more than 2-3 years between 4.1BSD and =
4.2BSD.

Yes, Summer 81 - Summer 82 must have been a vibrant year, with much =
interaction between various Unix groups. By the way, dmr was on the =
4.2BSD steering group.

help/changes in the KPI interface - which is actually funny, they =

more friendly to a multiprocessor/coprocessor architecture).  FWIW: I =
never got them when I was at UCB.
