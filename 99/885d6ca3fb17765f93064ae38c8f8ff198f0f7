My favorite is due to Dave Clark at MIT: “Anytime someone says ‘virtual’ you should think ‘slow’”

followed closely by “Any problem in computer science can be solved by adding a layer of abstraction” and “Any performance problem can be solved by removing a layer of abstraction.”

As one converted to the HPC cults, I am naturally opposed to small pages, virtual anything, and interrupts…
