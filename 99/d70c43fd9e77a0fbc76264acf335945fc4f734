Yeah, I was talking about 25-30 years ago.  And even then there were
people who were there for the paycheck.  But the people I considered
my peers were people who cared deeply about doing work well.  The
motivation was that we were at Sun, everyone wanted a Sun workstation,
which made it all the more important that we did stuff right.

If you need any proof, look no further than me.  I was the guy who was
so happy to be at Sun, I walked around for 3 years saying "I'd do this
job for free if I had enough money" :)

I think that feeling still exists but it is much harder to find these
days, systems work seems to have dried up, kids think a server is a
VM, it's a strange world.

Huh, I didn't know IBM gave bonuses for papers, Sun never did.  I don't
remember, but they may have paid for us to go to a conference.

Tell me about it.  Systems work just isn't what it once was.
