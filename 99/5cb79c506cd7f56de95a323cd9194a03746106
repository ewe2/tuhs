Tim, a small suggestion, could you modify assemv7 to source a config file
at the top, e.g:

# settings: insert lines similar to these in your config file
# APOUT=/usr/home/wkt/.bin/apout
# APOUT_ROOT=/usr/local/src/V7
# COLD=1
# 
. tools/assemv7.cfg

so that we don't have to modify the script that comes out of svn, but we
can edit a separate file which isn't in the svn repository. That'd be great!

Thanks,
	Warren
