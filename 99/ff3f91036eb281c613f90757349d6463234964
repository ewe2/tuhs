I tried the following on  my Solaris 10 box:

refer  cstr100 | troff -ms -Tpost | /usr/lib/lp/postscript/dpost >cstr100.ps

It composes fine until the first underline (.ul) but puts the
bibliography at the end with the error message "No files Ind"..
Without refer, it composes the entire document fine but without the
references.  No font errors.
