Also, what was the

originally /usr, placed on a separate disk, was what became /home much late=
r. Then disk space of / was running out and more an more applications and l=
ibs were moved to the /usr device.
Much later in the 80ths much more disk space was available and a separate /=
home was created. Exacly when I don't know, but there was no /home in Ed. 7=
 but System V release 3 had it already.
