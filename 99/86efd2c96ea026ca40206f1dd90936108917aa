The only compiler I know of that deals properly with generating 16-bit
x86 code is bcc, which the Elks folks use to build their kernel.  This
is Bruce Evan's compiler with support for prototypes bolted on, iirc.

It is a tad Linux centric, but I was able to get it to build with only
a few tweaks on FreeBSD.  It is sufficient to build the elks tree, but
I've not tried it on anything else.
