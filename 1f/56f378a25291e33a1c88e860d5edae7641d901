I think another reason is that AT&T got a lot more, er, "difficult"
about its licensing come SVR3, which introduced RFS. Many of the major
UNIX vendors (IBM, DEC, HP) didn't bother to license it. As most of them
already had NFS, it wasn't worth the trouble.

SunOS 4.0 had RFS. I think early versions of 4.1 did, but I'm pretty
sure that by 4.1.3 SunOS had removed it.
