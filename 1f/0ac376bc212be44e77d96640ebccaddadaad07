I once thought of developing a computer where everything from the core functions to the peripherals 
was a network node. In effect replacing the bus. I found references to a Cambridge U (UK) computer 
system that purported to do just that but couldn't find any more info on it.

Your idea sounds like an extension of Oberon, from what I can remember of reading Wirth's book on the 
Oberon OS in the nineties.

You should give it a go.
