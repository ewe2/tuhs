Consider giving a copy to Google.  Back in August 2000 they were
looking for old Usenet news archive CDs such as those from Sterling
Software, pre-dating 1995.  At the time, I pointed a few leads to and
exchanged a few messages with Michael Schmitt <michael at google.com>.

This applies to anyone with old backup tapes of Usenet news, of course.
