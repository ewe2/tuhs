That's what we're here for... :-)


    > I have an 11/23+ does that make a difference?

No. The KDF11-B of the 23+:

  http://gunkies.org/wiki/KDF11-B_CPU

is the same CPU as all the other KDF11 CPUs; it just has a couple of extra
peripherals on the board (2 asyn serial lines, and some PROMs, IIRC).

    > From the manual it seems to have an MMU

Like all KDF11 CPUs, it has a socket for an MMU chip, but the chip may or may
not be there (I don't know if it was standard on the 23+; and in any event, it
may have been pulled - the CPU will work without it). The main CPU is a DIP
carrier which holds two chips; the optional KTF11-A MMU has one (see the
image, above); the optional KEF11-A FPU is also a carrier with two chips. (The
KDF11-B can also hold the large 6-chip carrier of the optional KEF11-B CIS
chip - a rara avid indeed, if you'relucky enough to have it.)

If yours doesn't have the MMU chip, you're probably SOL; those are very rare.
KEF11-A FPU chips are avilable on eBay for modest amounts.

    > I'm not sure if it's split I/D.

None of the KDF11 CPUs support splite I/D.
