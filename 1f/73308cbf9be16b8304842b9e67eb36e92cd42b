OK, here it is:

  http://ana-3.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/tech/unix/s2/stp.h
  http://ana-3.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/tech/unix/s2/stp1.c
  http://ana-3.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/tech/unix/s2/stp2.c
  http://ana-3.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/tech/unix/s2/stp3.c

That MIT PWB1+ tape has so many treasures on it! (We've already seen all the

making the whole works available.
