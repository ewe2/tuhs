You and me both.  I always thought forth was a little weird, not bad
weird, just weird.  But I had worked on a forth system before, done
some programming in it, so I could deal.

But when I met EFI I yearned for the good old forth boot proms :(

My guess is that Mitch wanted too much money for Intel to go for it,
Intel is super super cheap.
