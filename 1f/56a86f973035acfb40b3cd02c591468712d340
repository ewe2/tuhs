Both FreeBSD and Linux supported shared libraries for a.out, though I can't
recall which of the *MAGIC formats they were. The Linux ones had fixed load
addresses, while the FreeBSD ones allowed any load address. Each of these
approaches has pros and cons, but both were tossed away in favor of ELF
just as soon as ELF was stable. Though, FreeBSD still has an a.out run time
linker in the tree. I wouldn't think it was still in use, but the
maintainer still fixes a bug in it every 9-24 months that some user has
reported...
