More like beating my argument with a pipe than the owner.

Its specific purpose was to make per-user quotas practical, but since
per-user quotas are as dead as the dodo, it no longer serves any known
purpose.  Yes, it blocks a particularly crude substitute for MAC in the
now-unusual case of true timesharing as opposed to single-user clients
and single-purpose servers.  But really it is nothing but security by
ceremonial.  A better case could be made that it should require root
privilege to perform chmod, or at least any chmod that widens access.
