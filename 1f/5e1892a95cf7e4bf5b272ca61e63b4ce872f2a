Yup, that was Steve Ward's folks in the MIT/RTS group - it was the NU
computer work.  John Siber did most of the compiler work (funny, Steve
Johnson and I were talking about some of that work last night at the UNIX50
party last night).  tjt wrote the 68K assembler ward's folks used.  I don't
remember where the Z8000 assembler came, but I'm petty sure that the Intel
assembler and some of the tools other John had brought back from his
summers in MH.

I think (but don't know for sure) the Intel 8086 assembler was done at AT&T
first.  IIRC it may have come out of Dale's group in Columbus.   I do know
Dale's group had done a Z80 C Compiler using the Ritchie Compiler at some
point in 1978 timeframe (and at one time I had, but can not seem to find
it, in my archives).

When Intel released the 386, I believe the AT&T 8086 assembler was updated
for the new 32 instructions; although who did that/where was done, I'm not
sure.

Steve is probably the best source for most of this as he managed the team
in Summit doing the different AT&T front and back ends when they tried to
centralize the compiler work for UNIX.
