Maybe I'm the odd one out here, but at home I've only got a Windows/10
notebook :-)

Mind you, at work I play with
. aDEC 400xP, DECpc MTE, Prioris XL server running SCO UNIX 3.2V4.2
. AlphaServer DS10 running Digital Unix 4.0g
. AlphaServer DS15 running Tru64 Unix 5.1B
. HP(E) rx-servers rx1620, rx2620, rx2660 running HP-UX 11.23
. HP(E) rx-servers rx2800 i2/i4 running HP-UX 11.31
. DOS 6.22, Windows/Xp, Windows/7 clients

Maintaining applications which were conceived late 80s is fun :-)
