I realize you would probably know better, but ...

I didn't mean that streams was the first thing in Plan 9, just that the
I/O system for pipes, network devices, etc. was descended from streams.
That was the case at least as far back as 1990.

Look at the early Plan 9 code for the pipe¹ and ethernet² devices, the
code for Streams, Queues, and Blocks in port/stream.c³ and power/dat.h⁴,
and tell me that doesn't descend from v8 streams. :)

Also, thanks for Plan 9. It's lovely.
