They had their own I/O calls such as send()/recv() (and still do).

Huh; imagine my surprise when I named a function "shutdown()" because
it was called at SIGTERM to clean up...

And that's being polite...  They are the worst interface that I have ever 
seen (including OS/360).  At a previous $ORKPLACE there was a library that 
said simply "I am server on port N" and "I want to contact a service on 
a.b.c.d on port N"; I wish I'd stole^Wborrowed it when we eventually 
parted company.
