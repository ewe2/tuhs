Ok, I may well be confused.

Before I took the comments the IOT vector was zero.  After I removed
them the IOT vector (34) was correct.

Perhaps the code wants to be loaded at 014 instead of 0.
I put the comments back in - I'll try changing where I load.

I thought only fpsym was undefined in those vectors.

I sure looks like they used an 11/20 with a KE11A board.

I can do that.  Are there docs on the DC-11?
