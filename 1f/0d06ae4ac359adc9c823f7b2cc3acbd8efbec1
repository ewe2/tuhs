There is no existing SCCS history for those two files.
But you can see the background about it in the README from the SCCS.
http://svnweb.freebsd.org/csrg/share/dict/README?revision=49371&view=markup
(Also in the later FreeBSD README too.)

The web2 files were first introduced in 4.3BSD as documented in the 
changes documentation (between the 4.2BSD distribution of July 1983 and 
the 4.3 revision in 1986) 4.3BSD's usr/doc/smm/12.uchanges/7.t (but I 
don't see this in the SCCS history).

We only have the complete operating system as of 3BSD and later and they 
include "words" file from 32V. It doesn't have "Kernighan", "McIlroy", 
nor "organizationally". The version continued from 32V is
