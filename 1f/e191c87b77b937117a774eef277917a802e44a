My memory of the Kyber (as we called them; we had a 72) was that it was 
not character-addressable, but 60-bit word-addressable, thus making string 
handling somewhat difficult.  Don't get me started on its utterly broken 
architecture...  I have thankfully lost my programming manual for the 
beast.

Parity only slowed it down, and besides, hardware never failed...

My fondest memory of the thing was its command completion; I would start 
to type "O, TR" and it would fill out "O, TRANSACTION TERMINAL STATUS".  
Which reminds me that my worst memory was its console keyboard, with "0"
on the left...
