Subject: [TUHS] Version 5 Manual
Message-ID: <20150207185327.DDF7F18C0B9@mercury.lcs.mit.edu>

So, I have a chance to buy a copy of a Version 5 manual, but it will be a
lot. I looked, and the Version 5 manual doesn't appear to be online. So while
normally at the price this is at, I would pass, it might be worth it for me
to buy it, and scan it to make it available.

But, I looked in the "FAQ on the Unix Archive and Unix on the PDP-11", and it
says:

  5th Edition has its on-line manual pages missing. ... Fortunately, we do
  have paper copies of all the research editions of UNIX from 1st to 7th
  Edition, and these will be scanned in and OCR'd.

Several questions: First, when it says "we do have paper copies of all the
research editions of UNIX", I assume it means 'we do have paper copies of
_the manuals for_ all the research editions of UNIX', not 'we do have paper
copies of _the source code for_ all the research editions of UNIX'?

Second, if it is 'manuals', did the scan/OCR thing ever happen, or is it
likely to anytime in the moderate future (next couple of years)?

Third, would a scanned (which I guess we could OCR) version of this manual be
of much use (it would not, after all, be the NROFF source, although probably
a lot of the commands will be identical to the V6 ones, for which we do have
the NROFF)?

Advice, please? Thanks!

	Noel
