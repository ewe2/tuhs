OK, here's the story...  Oh, Arthur, your SPF rejected me due to what is 
likely a YATS (Yet Another Telstra Screwup); I've since removed the record 
(it was just a place-holder anyway) but I forgot to update the TTL first.

First, for the non-Aussies here, a simple glossary:

NBN: National Broadband Network.  Also known as No Brain Network, it's our 
national network infrastructure, powered (if that's the right word) by an 
ugly mix of technologies, viz: FTTP (which I have), FTTN (which most 
people have - sort of ADSL on steroids), FTTC (a new innovation), HFC (for 
those with cable), and for all I know tribal drums.  Supposed to be FTTP 
to everyone, until the incoming conservative government decided that FTTP 
everywhere was far too good for the sheeple.

Telstra: Technically Telstra BigPond, it's the biggest ISP in the country, 
one of the most expensive, and likely the worst, service-wise.  Fondly 
known as T$, Helstra etc, I think the only reason I stick with them is 
Stockholm Syndrome (that, and a 2 year contract).

Now, you cannot contact NBN directly; you have to go through your ISP (in 
my case T$) i.e. speak to the monkey, not the organ-grinder.

OK...  Full story for the morbidly interested available on request as a 
redacted version of my complaint to Telstra; hell, if I'm in an ugly 
enough mood I'll put it on my web page (it's an RTF file).

My NBN service was cut off on 25th March, when NBN themselves not only 
sliced through my fibre cable at the adjacent pit but for good measure 
also disconnected it from the concentrator in the next pit; they are yet 
to explain just why, but they couldn't've done a better job of sabotaging 
my service if they'd tried.

After much to-ing and fro-ing with T$'s helldesk (broken promises to turn 
up, return calls, etc), I finally had service restored on 20th May; that's 
57 days (yes, I received a credit for lack of service, but not for the 
mobile (ObUS: cellular) calls that I had to make on a competing service).

A nice new wireless router was supplied with automatic (I think) 4G backup 
(naturally with little documentation), but I realised that the port 
forwarding rules were the same as my old router (a Technicolor F@st 5355).

Of course I got auto-unsubscribed from various mailing lists; the trick 
was to figure out which ones...  FreeBSD-ports didn't notice my absence, 
and neither did Krebs on Security; I've since tracked down a few more and 
re-subscribed.

Now, this is where TUHS comes in.  Hmmm...  Awfully quiet, yet it's 
supposed to be an active list.  Am I still subscribed?  Quickest way to 
find out is to post to it, and a well-run mailing list will return a 
snotty-gram along with an URL.

Did I get one?  Nope.  Was it accepted?  Apparently so...

So, why isn't any traffic coming my way?  And for the smart-arses (ObUS: 
smart-asses) out there who think I must be blocking it, nope, I watch my 
mail reject log like a hawk (I have all sorts of reporting scripts) and 
Minnie was definitely not there.

Are you still here, Warren?  I did email you, but no reply so far (and no 
reject either, otherwise I would've spotted *that* too).

If anyone has a better way to determine list membership other than by 
posting to it then I'm all ears/eyes; there are just too many ways to 
subscribe these days (not everyone uses Mailman, and some are by 
invitation only).

Happy, now?

Hours spend on this sh1t so far, and hours yet to go...
