It looks like the same thing I am doing, but...

We don't seem to have the same sizes...

-rw-r--r--    1 luvisi   luvisi    3086172 Jun 20 09:44 sys3.tap
-rw-r--r--    1 luvisi   luvisi       9216 Mar 18 16:12 boot
-rw-r--r--    1 luvisi   luvisi    3072000 Mar 18 16:12 mini-root

If I replace
  add_file("boot", 512);
with
  add_file("/dev/null", 512);

I get 3076812, so I suspect that your "boot" file is empty.
