Correct, it isn't.  You cannot run 2.11BSD in a PDP-11/23 or similar 
machine because a lot of things in 2.11BSD require split I&D.  It's 
declared on the first page of the setup instructions:

    "This distribution can be booted on a PDP-11 with 1Mb of memory or
     more, separate I&D, and with any of the following disks:"

You need an 11/73 or better to have split I&D.  For those who might not 
know what that means, it refers to the processor's ability to keep 
I(nstructions) and D(ata) in separate spaces, so in effect virtually 
doubling the amount of memory that can be used.  That is, you can have 
(almost) 64K of instructions *and* (almost) 64K of data at the same 
time.  Without split I&D, you have 64K in total for both.
