It also helps to manage many of them in larger cabinets.

In 1991-1992, we added self made ISDN boards to the Boot-Prom socket of
Sun 3-50s, put several of them into a Sun/3-160 cabinet that then was put into 
the computer room of the TU-Berlin as a ISDN<->IP gateway for students.

There was e.g. a cabinet with the machines named "fa", "so", "la" "si" in the
domain ".isdn.cs-tu-berlin.de".
