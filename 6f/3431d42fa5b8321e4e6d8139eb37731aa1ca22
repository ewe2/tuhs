I understand that Dave Presotto bought that photo at a garage sale for =
$1.  The photo hung in
the Unix Room for years, at one point labeled =E2=80=9CPeter =
Weinberger.=E2=80=9D

One day I removed it from its careful mounting and scanned in the photo. =
 It bore the label
=E2=80=9Cwhat, no steak?=E2=80=9D =20

The photo was stolen from a wall sometime after I left.  The scanned =
image is at
