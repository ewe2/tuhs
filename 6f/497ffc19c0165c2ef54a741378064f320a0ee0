I don't think I actually have access to any *Unix* machines except for a 
friend's Solaris server... everything I use that isn't Windows is either 
Linux (almost always some sort of Debian) or some sort of BSD.

Not that I wouldn't like to be running some sort of "Real Unix®™©, 
keeping in mind that they're not usually a good fit for commodity PC 
hardware (even Solaris never really was, I don't think).

-uso.
