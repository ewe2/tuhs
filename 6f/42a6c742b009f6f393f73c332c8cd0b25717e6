Yeah, I get ordered writes, I taught a CS course at Stanford and I made
my students learn all about them.  I'm a UFS guy, so far as I know I'm
the last guy to push UFS/FFS forward (which is sort of sad).  

The Linux stuff is better.  It just is.  And we should all respect that,
I know we sit around and love on ancient Unix, and believe me, I love 
that stuff it changed the world, but we should respect people who have
moved it past what Unix did.  And I think Linux moved the file system
past what Unix did.
