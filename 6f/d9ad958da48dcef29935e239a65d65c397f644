While I'd pronounce zealloc as Zee-alloc;  I'd not be inclined
to pronounce zalloc that way,  nor as Zed-alloc, but as Zal-loc
(rhymes with Sal-loc).  Maybe Larry had this pronounciation
in mind?

Similarly,  I pronounce 'calloc' as Kal-loc not, See-alloc.

So other folk from England should have no trouble :-)
