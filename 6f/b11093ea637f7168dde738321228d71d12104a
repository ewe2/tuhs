FreeBSD certainly does let you send packets over bpf.  If you open the
device (e.g. /dev/bpf0) for both reading and writing, you can write()
a buffer to the device, and the contents of that buffer will be sent
verbatim from that device.  I do this all the time for protocol
testing.

I'm not running NetBSD or OpenBSD currently, so perhaps they support a
richer interface than FreeBSD does, but the essentials are indeed
there.
