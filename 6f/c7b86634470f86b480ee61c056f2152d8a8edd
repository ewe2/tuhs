It's not unusual to have no /usr/bin at first,
see "Setting Up Unix" in the 7th ed man, vol2b:

"The system as distributed has all of the binaries in /bin.  Most of
 them should be moved to /usr/bin, leaving only the ones required for
 system maintenance (such as icheck, dcheck, cc, ed, restor, etc.)
 and the most heavily used in /bin.  This will speed things up a bit
 if you have only one disk, and also free up space on the root file
 system for temporary files."
