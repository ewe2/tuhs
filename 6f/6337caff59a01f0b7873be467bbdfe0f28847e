Very cool!

I note that Linux already has the 'sysv' kernel module which supports
System V short-filename file systems.  Enhancing that for V7 and early
BSD may be a faster route to having such file system images be mountable.
(But perhaps less fun than a FUSE filesystem that uses original Unix code.)

An enhanced version of the sysv kernel module that supports filesystems
from the AT&T Unix PC / 3B1 is available at
