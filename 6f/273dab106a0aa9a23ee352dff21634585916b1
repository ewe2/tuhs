Are any PWB releases publicly available?  Though they aren't explicitly
enumerated by the 2002 Caldera license, there's surely no one left with
standing to object to its publication today.

Reversing the apostolic precept to be all things to all men, I usually [before
Darwin] defended the tenability of the received doctrines, when I had to do
with the [evolution]ists; and stood up for the possibility of [evolution] among
the orthodox --thereby, no doubt, increasing an already current, but quite
undeserved, reputation for needless combativeness.  --T. H. Huxley
