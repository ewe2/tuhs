Dunno, as I've never used it, but there are some clever tricks that can be 
used to enforce RFC-compliancy (a lot of spamware is written by idiots who 
don't understand the finer points of SMTP):

     Enforce proper DNS configuration e.g. must resolve etc, and must
     actually exist.

     Make 'em wait a few seconds before sending your own banner, and drop
     the connection if they send beforehand.

     Set up an enormous greeting banner (many long lines); there is nothing
     in the RFC that says it has to be a single short line.

These simple measures alone cut out most of the crap; the rest are handled 
by various DNSBLs and my private access list.
