MTS had something similar.  At the U of Alberta, it displayed the HASP batch and print queues on a monitor in the "I/O" room  on the 2nd floor of the General Services Building, where you came to submit card decks and pick up print jobs.  My memory says that was part of the HASP system operator job.

I think there might have been a top-style variant of "$SYSTEMSTATUS <mumble>" that would run on the public 3270 (and AJ510) terminals.  But I would have to fire up Hercules to confirm that.
