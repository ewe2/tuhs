Weird, I thought what you describe was the traditional behaviour, e.g.

https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=read&sektion=2&manpath=4.3BSD+NET%2F2
https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=read&sektion=2&manpath=SunOS+4.1.3

both say you only get EINTR if nothing was read. (This detail seems to go
back to the 4.1c manual.) Was this a BSDism?

Tony.
