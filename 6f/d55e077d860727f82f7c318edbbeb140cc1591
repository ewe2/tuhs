Subject: [TUHS] SCO reveals major UNIXT IP violations

Gregg C Levine:

  Kenneth, doesn't that mean, that their case can be closed, because
  they themselves are the guilty party? Caldera was bought by SCO.

I thought it was the other way around: Caldera bought the UNIX-OS part
of SCO, then (around the time the current fracas started) renamed
themselves The SCO Group.
