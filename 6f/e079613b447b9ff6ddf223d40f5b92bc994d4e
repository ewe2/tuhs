Oh, one other thing that springs to mind: I'm not sure Ultrix-32 is strictly 
OK to have in the archive, either; when I first tried to buy an Ultrix source
license (for Ultrix 3.1 at that time, and then again for Ultrix 4.0) I was
told that I needed not a 32V license, which I had, but a SVR2 license, which
was basically unobtainable at that time, before DEC would sell me an Ultrix
source distribution.  Did someone correct this misunderstanding before Ultrix
was placed in the archive?
