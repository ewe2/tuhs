Ouch -- I was 1/2 of the Magnolia development team -- I remember a lot
about it!!!
For the curious when bitsavers comes back:   <goog_573452328>
http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/tektronix/magnolia/

Roger Bates had just finished the Dorado at PARC.  I had just left CMU.
 We were cubical mates in TekLabs.   Motorola had an experimental chip that
was not yet numbered.   We were given them in the Computer Research group
in Tek Labs. So, we started building a personal computer at night for
ourselves.

Our boss saw the notes and asked what we would do differently if Tek paid
for it.  I was originally using 8" floppies and immediately said 'a real
disk.'   We got a Tek '$10K project' and a few months to build a prototype.
I already had written (well sort of hacked) a simple C compiler based on
Dennis's PDP-11 compiler (when it screwed up it would sometimes include
PDP-11 code - and I never supported FP).   Paul Blattner wrote an assembler
and linker.     Using that, Steve Glaser and I ported UNIX/V7 to it.

That was 2+ years later actually.   Once they had the system, a couple of
other folks moved Smalltalk to it.  And in fact, it eventually did release
it as a product called the 4404.

Be careful... It most definitely did have an MMU, I designed it!!!  The
Xerox Altos and Dorado's never had MMU's.  So Roger was not familiar with
them.  I had to teach him.   Magnolia had a base/limit register MMU similar
to the PDP-11/70.  The original OS was V7 and swapped.  It ran just fine.

The wire-wrapped prototype was originally an X-series chip and yes the
first 'production' units were real 10Mhz 68000s.   After I went back to
grad school, Roger spliced a 68010 into and ripped out my MMU.  The late
Terry Laskodi put 4.1BSD on it.

Very possible, but they did have first mover position.  In fact, folks at
Harvard Business as much as said so later.  There is a great HBS case study
written about it called "Why Skunk Projects Don't Work" (which I have
somewhere) -- I should get that scanned at added to the Magnolia archive on
BitSavers.

No doubt... but it was 3 years later.   Which I think was a huge issue.

Which of course was what Magnolia had been 3.5 years earlier and was what
became the 4404 Smalltalk machine.
