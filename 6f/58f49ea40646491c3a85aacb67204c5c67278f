It is a fairly early version, with commentary, of PDP-11 Unix (the kernel),
indeed still in assembler.  It is an interesting find, probably
the earliest version yet unearthed.  Kossow told me about
it when he did (or got) the scan of the document.

I can't remember receiving it at the time.

It is clearly different from what we in the research
group were running at the time--it has devices we didn't have,
and I think by then we were on the 11/45.
