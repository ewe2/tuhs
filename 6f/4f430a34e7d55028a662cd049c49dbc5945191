I'm not sure it's so much the file system (in the sense of the on-disk
format), as how the system _used_ it (although I suppose one could consider
that part of the FS too).

The duplicated FAT, and the way file sectors are linked using it, is I suppose
a little more robust than other designs (e.g. the way early Unixes did it,
with indirect blocks and free lists), but I think a lot of it must have been
that DOS wrote stuff out quickly (as opposed to e.g. the delayed writes on
early Unix FS's, etc). That probably appoximated the write-ordering of more
designed-robust FS's.
