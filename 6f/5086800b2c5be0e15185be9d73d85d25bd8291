Hmmmm... you may just be mixing up the names of the archive tools you
mean, but on the other hand maybe you don't know that "dump" does whole
filesystems, not just sub-directories.

That of course doesn't take anything away from what you were saying
about making sure you could do a full dump onto a single tape with some
types of less high-end and high-quality tape devices.  But that's a
"newer" problem.

Original Unix dump(1m) had no trouble asking for additional tapes to be
mounted when the filesystem required multiple tapes.

So it has nothing to do with legacy of the original root and /usr split.

An interesting compilation, but sadly (to me at least) it is mostly a
mess of GNU/Linux which, rightly or wrongly, I categorize all under one
(extremely opaque) umbrella.

BTW, when I said "long ago" for Solaris, I meant a REALLY long time ago.
/bin has been a symlink to /usr/bin since Solaris 2.0 and yet /usr
could/can still be a separate filesystem on a Solaris installation.
This is accomplished by putting everything necessary to boot the system
up to the point where other additional filesystems can be mounted using
just the programs found in /sbin.  Of course this wasn't done smoothly
and completely all in one go.  IIRC /sbin/sh didn't exist until
Solaris-9, and (also IIRC) it is just a copy of /usr/bin/sh.

So Sun pushed everything in /bin to /usr/bin, then copied a few things
back to /sbin as they found they needed them.  Kind of a half-assed hack
that wasn't well thought out, and had very poor motivations.

I'd forgot that IRIX was following Solaris on this track.
