Ah, those were later versions; the originals were:

  0882 Domain names: Concepts and facilities. P.V. Mockapetris. November
     1983.
  0883 Domain names: Implementation specification. P.V. Mockapetris.
     November 1983.

Both were updated by RFC0973 before being replaced by 1034/1035.

You might also want to look at:

  0881 Domain names plan and schedule. J. Postel. November 1983.
  0897 Domain name system implementation schedule. J. Postel. February 1984.
  0921 Domain name system implementation schedule - revised. J. Postel. October 1984. 

Note that ".com" didn't exist in the early revs.
