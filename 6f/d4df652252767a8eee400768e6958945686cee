​I should have added, the /usr/group UNIX standard document became "draft
0" of the IEEE P1003.1 after being put into "official" IEEE format, with
some magic macro work by Jim, John Quarterman, and myself.  Ah the wonders
of troff.​   And it was originally formatted on a Masscomp MC-500 which I
would bring to the IEEE meetings, which was considered a wonderment at that
time.   We could actually edit the document as we discussed it!!!   There
was no such thing as a laptop and the even the "Compaq Luggable" PC was
still a few years out.
