Subject: [TUHS] [Bourne shell] SVR1
Message-ID: <20020723132730.GA24587@wega.rz.uni-ulm.de>

Hello,

I'm searching for documentation about the SVR1 shell: i would be glad
if somebody could dig up e.g. a man page or the 1st edition of the
SVID (System V Interface Definition).

I'm interested in the history of the Bourne shell, and this is the last
important variant i'm missing (my current knowledge documented in .sig).

I know the short "changes" paragraph in the 2nd SVID, however a few
points are still unclear to me.

Sven
