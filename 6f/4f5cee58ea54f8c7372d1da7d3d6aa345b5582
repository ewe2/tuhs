No. 

On PDP 11 assembler the left and right shifts were a
single < and >.

You made a typo when transcribing the source
statement: you typed

> 0636: mov $USIZE-1/<8|6, (r1)+

but the actual code from m40.s reads

> 0636:         mov     $usize-1\<8|6,(r1)+

However, since < and > where also used to delimit
strings, there was a
need to escape them so as to distinguish their usage
as shifts from the
string delimiters. The escaping was achieved by \
which is what you see
in the code.

See the assembler section of vol 2b of the Unix V7
manuals for details at
	http://plan9.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/v7vol2b.pdf
or
	http://web.cuzuco.com/%7Ecuzuco/v7/v7vol2b.pdf
namely:

6.1 Expression operators
	The operators are:
	(blank) when there is no operand between operands,
the effect is 
		exactly the same as if a + had appeared.
	+ addition
	 subtraction
	* multiplication
	\/ division (note that plain  /  starts a
comment)
	& bitwise and
	| bitwise or
	\> logical right shift
	\< logical left shift
	...   ...   ...
