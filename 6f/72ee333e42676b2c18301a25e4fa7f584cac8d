Really?  Are we talking about those tapes that looked like reel to reel
audio tapes but bigger?  Like this?

Because those are 1000x more reliable than an exabyte tape, they just 
worked.  Pretty much no matter what, you can spool up that tape and it
will read.  30 years later it will read.

Exabyte won't read 20 minutes later.
