At the same time, I think some sort of GPL'ed kernel was inevitable for any
number of reasons.

Also, I worked closely with one of the principals in Linux back then (i.e.
1991) and his experience was that the linux community was way more open to
his contributions than the bsd community. Not surprising, linux was pretty
much a clean sheet. I expect that was a factor as well.
