APL (excepting some early implementations) lets you set the "index origin" 
to either 0 or 1, either by assigning a value to the quad-IO system 
variable, or through the ')ORIGIN' command (varies with the 
implementation).

Changing quad-IO inside a function at runtime was a trick used to inflict 
endless terror on many a first-year undergrad ;-)
