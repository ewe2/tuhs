Clem Cole:

  IIRC this is part of the argument Dykstra made with the THE paper years
  ago, Parnas in his information hiding paper -- i.e. why microkernels and
  proper layering are a good idea.   Keep is simple and do one thing
  well/protect yourself against other subsystems not being 100%.

Indeed.  Complexity creates needless RISC, er, risk.
