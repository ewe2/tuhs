This work is AMAZING!  I've been collecting UNIX source code and 
documents since the mid '90's.  I have accumulated more that 20 gig of 
stuff ( including goodies like the NCD contributed CD they use to 
distribute with their X-tubes and one release of the Prime Time Freeware 
for UNIX ), and papers as PDF files I've found here and there ( like 
dmr's web page ).

But, my stuff is just a pile of barely organized sub-directories under 
~/unix on my main Linux system.  This work however ... is very well done.

Of course, I've snarked your paper and poster pdf's and am cloning the 
repository as I type this for my collection ( I only have the BSD stuff 
that's in the Archive ).

Congrats on the award.  It's well deserved!  And thanks for doing this!

I was wondering if you were planning on adding any of the Solaris stuff 
( I managed to get one source release of open Solaris before Oracle 
bought out sun ) or Darwin? Unfortunately, I don't seem to have the 
Darwin source anymore  ( some bits of my collection have been lost to 
time ), but I can contribute what I have of Open Solaris if you want it.
