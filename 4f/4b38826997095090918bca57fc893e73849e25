It was instilled in me early on by my one and only mentor that someone 
that comes along later may have no idea what my code is doing. So 
comment. Even when it might be self-explanitory, comment anyway. This 
was on TOPS-10 back in the early 80's, usually MACRO-10 although I 
dabbled in ALGOL, SNOBOL, FORTRAN, etc.

When I look back at my own code, I can read the comments as the 
plot-line, so to speak, and the code itself just follows along.

I have noticed a lot of newer programmers these days that say 
(paraphrased): "Good code will explain itself" as a reason not to 
comment. Mostly C++ and Java programmers.

I call bullshit on that. Not commenting is lazy. There's no reason NOT 
to comment.

Most of my stuff has more comments byte-wise than real code. Something I 
wrote just yesterday as part of a much larger project:

// remove the UTF-8 BOM at the beginning of a line of text.
char bom[] = { 0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF, 0 };                  // UTF-8 BOM
void remove_bom(char *str) {

     if (strncmp(str, bom, strlen(bom)) == 0) {         // can we find 
the BOM at the beginning of the line?
         strcpy(str, str + strlen(bom));             // yup, kill it.
     }
}

While that is definitely self-explanitory, I just can't help myself - 
and no, don't comment on my brazen assumptions of string length, or the 
fact that I assume it's UTF-8 - I've taken care of all of that 
elsewhere...  ;)
