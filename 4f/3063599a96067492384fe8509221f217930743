Hmm... As a manager, I'd be more annoyed if the code did not perform
according to spec than I would be if single programmer spent half an
hour amusing themselves.  Being pedantic about time is a surefire way of
demotivating a dev team.

No matter who pays (or not pays) for the code to be produced, the end
user, no matter it's clinical staff in a hospital or your uncle's son,
need to be guaranteed that the code doesn't trigger unexpected behaviour
when used.  The risk of that is usually smaller if the product does not
contain any easter eggs.
