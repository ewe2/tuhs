A friendly reminder that kabuki-west is not an appropriate forum for baby announcements! ;)

Unusually, I went directly bed when I got home to Mountain View instead of reading E-mail on apple.com before crashing out. Many of my dinner companions went back to the eXperimental Computing Facility (XCF - for undergrads) in Cory Hall on the UCB campus, found their facilities under attack, and coordinated with a team at MIT to perform analysis. I remember that Dave Pare put the binary analysis skills he'd acquired in decompiling psl's empire game to good use in analyzing the worm.

I shut off the finger TCP service, checked to make sure our sendmail(8) didn't have the "debug  mode feature" that the worm exploited, and told CSNET to turn us back on.
