Well, it=E2=80=99s not particularly hard to find a Mach system today.  The =
fruit
company makes computers and mobile phones with it.  Steve Jobs enamor for
Avie Tevanian is well chronicled in the common biographies.

The problem with Mach is their ukernel implementation was pretty shit while
the ideas were sound.  MacOS runs like an old dog to this day on anything
remotely system% intensive (like say a network server).

IBM abandoned the idea of any ukernel with AIX3 for RISC/6000.. Charlie may
be able to add commentary on that but it was almost certainly for
performance which was paramount in the workstation wars and RS6K had an
front runner opening.

The idea of small TCBs and IPC has really been perfected in L4 kernels;
seL4 in particular is one of the most interesting pieces of systems
software today.  Fruit company uses a different older L4 for their security
coprocessors and had a Darwin port for L4 at one point called Darbat.

Regards,
Kevin
