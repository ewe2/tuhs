It's a bit more complicated than that, so no one should rush out and claim that 
System III is public domain.  Omission from this set of documentation does not 
mean that no one owns it.  Instead, it means that the original owner still owns 
it.  Whether that is AT&T, Unix Systems Labs, now defunct, or the lawful owners 
of its assets, Lucent Technologies, Novell or SCO is uncertain, but there is an 
owner.

In my opinion, the original asset purchase agreement and follow on amendments 
were poorly written and do not address the actual ownership of intellectual 
property.  It is my opinion that they have confused license to use and 
distribute with ownership, i.e., copyright.  They would have done well to look 
at book contracts and author agreements for a model.

Of course, that is my opinion, not that of HP or anyone associated with HP.  In 
addition, I am not a lawyer and anyone affected by these matters should seek 
legal counsel prior to taking any action.
