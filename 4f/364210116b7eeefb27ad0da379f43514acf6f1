The various RT-11 emulators use variations on this theme as well, some
inside the kernel, some as a signal handler (fast forward 40-odd years and
I'm catching the SIGSEGV traps in executing 16-bit code to implement the
unix system calls)... It's a very useful and elegant trick that's been
oft-repeated.

Yes. They seemed to make perfect sense when I encountered them in Unix
after growing up on RSTS/e and RT-11 before my first contact with Unix....
