As far as I'm aware of there are currently no implementations of the 
filesystems mentioned above for Linux 2.5. I think the oldest Unix 
filesystems implemented are Minix FS, Xenix FS, SystemV FS and 
perhaps Coherent FS. Look at the fs/sysv directory in the Linux 
kernel to learn more about them. 

Send me more informations about the 2BSD and 2.11BSD filesystems and 
I will try to implement them for Linux (after I finished 5th,6th and 
7th Edititons' filesystems).
