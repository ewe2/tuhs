So I know the 386BSD guy, Bill Jolitz.  He worked for me at Sun, I hired 
him because of, well some Usenix details that are best left untold.  He
was unfairly hurt by Usenix, that's as much as I'll say.

He's a good guy, a little weird, but so am I.  He did some great work
in 386BSD, it was ahead of Linux.  I remember going into Fry's and 
sticking a 386BSD floppy in to see if it would boot.  It usually did.
