    > as Organick said in his 1972 book

A word of warning: i) Organick describes Multics as it was planned, not as it
was actually implemented; and ii) then it changed considerably during its
service life.

Examples of each: i) there was one linkage segment per processs, not per
segment (linkage info was copied across into the shared linkage segment when a
segment was dynamically added to a process' address space); ii) the New Storage
System.

The basic concepts (single level store, dynamic linking etc) are correct in
Organick, but be wary of anything past that. Not his fault, of course; things
just changed.

In the original design, no. In 1973-75, with the New Storage System:

  https://multicians.org/nss.html

mountable volumes were added (see MTB 229, "Use of Demountable Logical
Volumes", linked from the page above). It was released to customers in
June, 1976.
