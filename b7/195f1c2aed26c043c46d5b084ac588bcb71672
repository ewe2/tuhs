Of course the sequel to this thread will be to camelCase or not to
camel_case.  Or maybe whether to prefix functions and variable with a
type abbreviation like siCounter for a signed integer counter as if 99%
of people in 2021 are not using an editor that allows quick inspection
of variables and functions.  Maybe we can get to the third act of how to
align braces and parens! 

brb, getting some peanuts, popcorn, and a comfortable seat!

P.S. In all seriousness, keep it civil! :)

I saw an article talking about the 20 year feud, but that's not my recollection. In 1994, nobody agreed on this, but I'm sure it predates my entree into the field. I'm thinking the history of entab and detab are somehow related, but I've been wrong on these sorts of thoughts before. What say you?
