Rob:

  I rewrote cat to use just read and write, as
  nature intended. I don't recall if my version is in any of v8 v9 v10 ...

It is.  It was /bin/cat when I arrived at Murray Hill in 1984.
I remember being delighted with the elegant way to get rid of
a flag I had never really liked either.

I never knew Dennis had dragged his heels at it.  It was (to me)
so obviously the right answer that I never asked!
