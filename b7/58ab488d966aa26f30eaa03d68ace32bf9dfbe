It occurs to me that the tape is probably meant to be bootable.
The init program seeks to the 65th block to start booting, so blocks
0 through 64 can be used to hold a bootable kernel image or two.
I'm guessing we could make a tape as:

     blocks 0-31  - the "cold" kernel
     blocks 32-64 - the real kernel
     blocks 65-   - the contents of /bin and /etc

boot the cold kernel from tape, have it write out a primordeal root
file system on rf0.  Boot the real kernel from tape, have it
run the /etc/init that the cold kernel put onto rf0 which reads
files from blocks 65 onwards on the tape.  Finally reboot the real
kernel from tape again and be in a real system.

By the way, I made some tape images from the s2 binaries (just /etc
and /bin, /usr is probably meant to go onto rk0):

    http://www.thenewsh.com/%7Enewsham/unix_jun72/tape
        - the raw tape bits with the first 65 blocks empty
    http://www.thenewsh.com/%7Enewsham/unix_jun72/tape.tc
        - a simh format tape of the above bits

the tape image isnt tested yet.  It should hopefully have the right
uids and file modes for first ed.
