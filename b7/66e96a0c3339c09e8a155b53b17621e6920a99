Subject: [TUHS] A Legal History of Unix
Message-ID: <20180411133209.GA20747@minnie.tuhs.org>

I was sure that I'd read a paper on the legal history of Unix. So I did a
Google search for it, and found a link to the PDF. The linked PDF was on
the TUHS website :-)

I'd better do a backup of my brain, as I've got a few flakey DRAM chips.

Cheers, Warren
