Yup, it seems flimsy IBM arranged over $100k a few years ago at my
request to do the initial FreeBSD bringup on powernv in addition to
time and hooking us up with Eldorado Institute.  Had there been a
commercial deployment there would have been a lot more help and PR.
They have and use pfsense in the IBM cloud.  It seems like the lawyers
didn't do any discovery.  It will be interesting to watch.

This list will enjoy digging through this
http://tenox.pdp-11.ru/monterey/ -- whoever made these business
decisions to dump Monterey/IA64 before shipping was good at decision
making in a way I haven't seen in my own career.  I've long suspected
the purchase of Sequent was the real downfall to working with SCO.
That too was a great decision.

Kevin
