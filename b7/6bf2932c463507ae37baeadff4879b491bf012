Deja News was a customer of the data center I worked at back in '97-'99, 
smartnap.net.  My usenet server fed directly into theirs, which made all 
of my other customers (and several other people on the net) want to peer 
with me, since one of the ways some people judged how "good" a usenet 
feed was was how quickly a post could be viewed on dejanews.com. They 
took up about 1/4 the space of our ~12k sq ft facility.

My current boss was one of the news admins there.  As I understood it, 
they had pretty much everything from when they started, plus had donated 
tapes of older stuff that they would periodically load up and add to the 
online bits.  By the time Google bought them, they'd dropped the 'News' 
part of their name and were focusing on being a product search engine 
under the name "Deja."  All Google was really interested in was the 
usenet archives.

Searching for an old username of mine on group.google.com finds posts I 
made in 1993, when I first started using usenet in college.
