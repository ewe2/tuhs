Yeah, you are right, I dug up the makefile I was using and it says

LIBS            = -lxview -lolgx -lX11

I really kind of liked that toolkit, it was all key/value like so:

        panel = xv_create(
	    frame, PANEL,
            XV_WIDTH, WIDTH,
	    XV_HEIGHT, 30,
            PANEL_LAYOUT, PANEL_HORIZONTAL,
            XV_SHOW, FALSE,
	    NULL);

So the order of the args didn't really matter, I think the first one
maybe did because that was the parent but not sure, the rest could
be any order you wanted.  Pretty simple.

Not as simple as Ousterhout's TK stuff, to this day, that's my goto
gui toolkit.
