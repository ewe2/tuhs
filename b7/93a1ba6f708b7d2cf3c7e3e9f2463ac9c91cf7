Or it THOUGHT it heard a tone - some people's voices could trigger it.

Or the actual bells still ringing for a short period of time after you 
picked up the handset even.

Some of the acoustic couplers I played around with would start signing 
when people were talking in the same room, or certain music was playing.

I did a lot of work with 300 (103 standard) and 1200 baud modems (both 
202 and 212 standard), and some of them were very quirky. I'm trying to 
remember if the 202 initiated any tones on the originating side, but I 
can't remember.

The 202 standard is still in use to transmit caller ID on phone lines 
between the 1st and 2nd rings.

Also, if they were used for dial-back, they could have been set to 
originate.
