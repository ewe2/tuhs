Larry,

How about a virtual birthday "card" where we make a site that people  
from all over the world can sign on and leave personalized "best  
wishes"?

To promote it, we design a modest logo that people can place on their  
websites, linking to the site, allowing visitors to read the various  
"cards", and encouraging them to leave their own messages.

We could add an /etc/passwd style listing of "users" with their own / 
etc/motd or "wishes of the day".  We could bootstrap it with the  
original passwd entries, recognizing and saying "thank you" to the  
creators and contibutors of UNIX, in a wiki style with proper  
monitoring of course.

What do you think?

Jim
