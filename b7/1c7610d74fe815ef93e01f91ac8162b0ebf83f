I've tried to incorporate the SCCS meta data in the Git commits.  Where 
that was not possible I added a header-like line in the Git commit message.

The BSD CSRG SCCS data are available on the four CD set compiled by 
Marshall Kirk McKusick https://www.mckusick.com/csrg/.

I don't know of any other SCCS data openly available.  If anyone has 
such data, I'd appreciate a copy.
