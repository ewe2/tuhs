Subject: [TUHS] # as first character of file
Message-ID: <CAP6exYLU-tQwdOpgU4GAuANa4WscoAdHu+rm+SyLRMLB3=VEWw@mail.gmail.com>

I just went looking at the v6 source to confirm a memory, namely that cpp
was only invoked if a # was the first character in the file. Hence, this:
https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V6-Snapshot-Development/usr/source/c/c01.c#L1

People occasionally forgot this, and hilarity ensued.

Now I'm curious. Anyone know when that convention ended?
