I think this would be a great addition to the archive!  I'm glad I
didn't throw out that old 286 motherboard yet.  :-)  -- Ian

Hi, yes it's now legal to distribute your code, as Caldera's license
allows for distribution of changes, see
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Caldera-license.pdf

I'm the guy who runs the Unix Archive, so I'd be very happy to take a
copy of your work and add it to the archive.

Cheers,
