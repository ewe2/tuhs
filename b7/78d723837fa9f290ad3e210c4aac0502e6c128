It's not clear what 'spell' is --- it differs from distro to distro,
often based on aspell.  Whatever is on Ubuntu doesn't even know
how to use 'sort -u' on its output.

For myself, I don't claim that v10spell is better or worse than anything
else out there; it simply provides another option, especially for fans
of the original Unix code. :-)
