My memory is that the modems that could also support Fax in those days, sucked at UUCP, so most of us did want to dedicate a phone line to one of them. 

In what sense?  Telebit came along early with their UUCP g-protocol spoofing, but that predated all the Hayes et al FAX support.  By the time modems grew (good) FAX support, UUCP was dying out in favour of PPP over V.xxx 56kb/s.  I had banks of Hayes (and other) V.x modems that handled dialup 38.4 + FAX quite cheerfully.  The Telebit UUCP-aware modems died out quite quickly once V.32 hit the streets.
