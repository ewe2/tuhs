From what I remember from a talk from Stephen Bourne at a Sun user group 
meeting in 1990, user maintained programs have been installed in /usr/bin.

Stephen Bourne after some time wrote a cron job that checked whether an update
in a binary also resulted in an updated man page and otherwise removed the 
binary. This is why these programs have man pages.
