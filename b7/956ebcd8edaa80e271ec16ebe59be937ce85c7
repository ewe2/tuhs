Year corrections?   Don't recall that but there were a bunch of changes to handle the insertion of leap SECONDS over the years.

During my first few years in the Unix room (starting in 1988) there was what seemed like a semiannual flurry of leap year corrections made to research unix.  Apparently, there was some aspect that kept misbehaving, with new bugs appearing at the next shift in time.

I never bothered to investigate the specifics, but it happened over several years.  There are probably some on this list who know more details.

I donâ€™t recall this being a problem on Plan 9.
