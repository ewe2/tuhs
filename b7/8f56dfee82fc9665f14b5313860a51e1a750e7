So I have to say "who cares?"  If we were talking about a modern multi
threaded, scaled SMP, NUMA aware, knows all about the latest PCI, etc,
OS, yes, whoever owns that might care.

I love the early Unix releases because they were so simple, processors
were simple then as well.

Other than as a learning tool, which is a big deal but not a financial
big deal, the early Unix versions have no value.  Nobody cares other
than us and we're, I dunno, but I would guess in the low thosands of
people.

I get that we all want the licenses to be above board but really, does
it matter?  Is anyone going to do anything with these early releases?
I worked on SCO, it was early when SunOS was around and it was not
friendly compared to SunOS and SunOS is long dead.  I can promise you
the number of people who care about SCO source are under 100.  As in
the people who would actually compile it, I bet it is under 10.

I'm all for doing the right thing but some of the time when people talk
about the licenses, I fail to see where a lawyer or a corporation is
going to care.  For them to care, they would need to see a way to make
money.  Nobody is going to make money off of 50 year old Unix releases.
Heck, nobody is going to make money off of 20 year old Unix releases.
As Rob Gingell said, bits rot.
