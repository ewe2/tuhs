Warren:

  I went to Dennis' home page this morning to find something, and it seems
  to be gone. The URL I'm using is http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/

=======

Looks like there has been substantial reorganization of
the company's web pages, doubtless to reflect reorganization
of the company itself.

I dug around to see where personal web pages seem to be now,
and tried some obvious guesses, and still couldn't find Dennis's
stuff.

I've sent a query to someone on the inside; I'll report back
if I find the answer.

It might be worth trying the Wayback Machine in the mean time.
