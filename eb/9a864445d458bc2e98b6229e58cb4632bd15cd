It would be nice. At this late date, one wonders what would happen if it
were
litigated again...  I suspect that nobody would bother given the small
possible
gain and the huge expense... But it would also reduce shareholder values
to explicitly say there's no copyright here or to clarify that the ancient
licenses
are valid. So we're in this state where it's basically free and clear,
treated like
it's free and clear, but really isn't free and clear.
