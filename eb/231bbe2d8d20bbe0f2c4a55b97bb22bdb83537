I have a dog in the fight, having joined in June 1980, but that is not
a coincidence. The period of 1980-1982 was a big one for 127 (soon
1127) as they were finally given the chance to grow, and I was one of
the lucky early hires in that burst. New blood brought in new ideas
and things happened fast.

It was also the time of the VAX; the center's 11/780 arrived in late
1980 I think, maybe early 1981. Our first experiments with graphical
terminals spanned 1980 to early 1981, using Greg Chesson's mux, but by
late 1981 we were using Dennis's streams (only STREAMS when they went
to USG) and the select system call, which was by then running in a
merged Berkeley/Research Unix that eventually became the Eighth
Edition.

My notebooks can probably lock down a lot of this as I was a prolific
note-taker back then, when they still made paper.
