Subject: [pups] gcc-.3.4.6 for pdp11
Message-ID: <000501c66b93$a91184e0$1901a8c0@myhome.westell.com>

    Does anyone know how to compile gcc-3.4.6 for the pdp11? I use
the --target=pdp11 switch and the compiler runs for awhile then breaks. The
output says it's bulding for a pdp11-unknown something so there maybe
something I'm not using.
