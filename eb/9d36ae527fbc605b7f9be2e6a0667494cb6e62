Amen...

My disagreement with them using scripting (python) as step one is the lack
of teaching data typing early AND python's silly use space/tabs to set up
structure instead of  real {} or B/E blocks.  Automatic data conversion has
never been a good idea in my experience because like many things that
happen magically, it almost never works as I expect.

Funny we were discussing the roff family and that is why I like it over
things like Word -- way too much hidden behind the screen for my taste.
I'm a make it explicit kinda guy I guess.  I hate surprises ...

Also, it remains to be seen if teaching FP early helps - which they are
clearly making play.  Who am I to say, as one of the earliest languages I
learned APL, so FP thinking was drilled into me in my youth.
