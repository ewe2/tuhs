Quoting from David Craddock's book, Dungeon Hacks (2015), pages 34-35:

> By the time Toy and Wichman started at UC Santa Cruz, BSD UNIX had entered
> widespread usage across UC campuses and was branching out to other schools.
> Each new version of BSD, released on cassette tape, included handy programs
> written by Joy and other hackers. One program was curses, written by Ken
> Arnold. Arnold had written curses according to the UNIX creed: a simple
> tool fashioned for a specific purpose. Wielding curses like a paintbrush,
> users could place text such as letters, numbers, and symbols at any
> location on the screen.



The moment he used curses, Toy saw its potential. In 1980, he went to

Craddock's notes explain that the quotes of Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman
"come from interviews conducted via phone, Skype, and email over 2012-2014."

I think you must be right about the first machine being something running
BSD UNIX.
