No way.  It already relies heavily on overlays to get things
done.  Even without the networking code (which requires I&D,
*and* Supervisor mode), there is pretty much no way to get it
to fit (even a small system) within a 64K space.

If you really need a UNIX that (slowly ;-) fits in the nonID
space, ytu Ultrix-11.  That fits, although its very slow on such 
machines.

Cheers,
