OK, Frank is likely correct.  But I still don't think you'll find it
anywhere
on the 'net!  It would be nice if it were in the PUP archives, though. 
Getting
it there might be hard because MS might still have some rights to it.

I did some digging, and here are some relevant dates:

 8/25/80   Microsoft announced DEC PDP-11 XENIX (along with versions for
several
           other machines--Intel 8086, Zilog Z8000, and Motorola
M68000).
           [This would have to be Version 7 based.]

10/01/80   Microsoft notes PDP-11 XENIX is "scheduled for release".
[It's not
           clear if this means it was actually released on that date.]

12/08/81   Microsoft and SCO signed a letter of intent for SCO to be a
second-
           source of XENIX.  [No mention of PDP-11; just that XENIX was
being
           upgraded to System III at that time.]

 1/22/85   Microsoft and AT&T announce plans for compatible future
releases
           of XENIX and UNIX [based on System V].

 1/31/86   Microsoft and SCO announce new agreements for SCO to be prime
distrubutor
           of XENIX System V to VAR and VAD channels.

 2/15/89   Microsoft makes 20% minority investment in SCO.  [I seem to
recall that
           SCO got (all?) XENIX rights at this time.]

So it looks like there was a window of about a year when a Version 7
based XENIX
was probably available.  Certainly starting in 1983 Microsoft announced
all sorts
of versions of XENIX for other hardware, including IBM System 9000 (yes,
there
really was a HAL 9000 (Motorola MC68000-based)--I had a couple), IBM
PC/AT, AT&T
UNIX PC and PC 6300, and Compaq machines.
