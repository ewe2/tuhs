Where are you located? I have an Olivetti-rebranded AT&T 3B2/400 
machine over here, but I live in The Netherlands and I have decided 
long ago never to lift that machine again and leave it where it 
stands now in the house. It may not be that big but it is very 
strongly built and it has two heavy full height 70 MB 5.25 hard disk 
drives in it. 

You see, the last time I carried this machine, more than 10 years 
ago, I hurt my back because of it and had to have six weeks of 
therapy. It bothers me to this day. The perils of collecting old 
computers, I guess.

What impressed me most when I got the machine, apart from my back 
problems, whas the impressive manuals that came with it, a row of red 
binders in grey sleeves with excellent documentation. Also I was 
surprised by the on/off switch, which does not blindly power off the 
machine but initates a proper shut down sequence, so you can shut it 
down properly without knowing any passwords. All *nix machines should 
have a power switch like that.

Also, the serial ports had RJ45 connectors already, and that is a lot 
easier if you have to put the plug in while fumbling about on the 
side, you can put them in without looking.

I'm not doing much with it now since my main interest in old 
computers still is the VAX.
