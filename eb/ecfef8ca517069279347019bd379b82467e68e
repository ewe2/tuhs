At www.skeeve.com/Usenet.tar.bz2 is a copy of UUNET's archives of the
various USENET source newsgroups. I created this file on September 2 2004.
I made it for myself, since it was clear that uu.net would disappear
sometime soon...

It's 139 Meg - Warren maybe you can put it into the archives and everyone
else can get it from there?  I think the person who hosts www.skeeve.com
has some monthly limits on data transfer and I don't want him blown
out of the water.

Thanks,

Arnold
