Well, it's done. The software is now available at
http://minnie.tuhs.org/Programs/Ctcompare. I have also made available
some tokenised source trees so you can do some comparisons straight away.

If anybody has Unix kernel trees which they cannot divulge due to licensing
restrictions, I'd appreciate you creating tokenised files of the kernel
source and e-mailing them to me.

Thanks!
