Hmm.  It's been a while.  I should fire up the old /83 and get all the
latest patches from Steven applied, while it's still winter, and I can
run it and the VAX without overheating my machine room.  :-)

All,

Just a note to let you know that I am making good progress on
getting my modified Ultrix-11 V3.1 up and running.  I'll be
uploading disk images of various MicroPDP-11 (/23, /53, /73,
/83) based systems for you to enjoy :)

Most of all, I should be able to run TK50 install tapes again as
of next week, given my working 11/83 with TK50.

Many thanks go to Bill Gunshannon for the initial image (I could
not get my boot tapes to work), Warren Toomey for letting me play
lots with VTserver and integrating it into Ultrix, Kees Stravers
for giving me the hardware I needed, and, of course, to The
Wanderer for figuring out my hardware problemns with me :)

Cheers,
	Fred

Blah!  And of course to Wilko Bulte, who provided the dumps of the
original V3.1 tapes, and with whom I spent quite some time debugging
the why-doesn-this-work problems with the initial tape dump files...

Fred (compiling stuff on the PDP so he can transfer stuff in and out
of the box without having to use the slow VTserver link ;-)

Thanks for the enlightening.

As we are on the topic cabinets: Can a 11/73 run in a BA21x or BA440

That is the reason why I disconnect console terminals bevore I power

'/lib/c0' is the first pass of the C compiler, after the preprocessor
has be run (the order is cc, c0, c1, c2 for the optimiser, and then 'as'
to produce the object file). I dimly recall that the various passes forked
by 'cc' didn't bother to catch signals, so any error just gives the
"Fatal error in ..." message. The '-c' would have no effect this early.

You could try the '-f' option, that uses a different compiler (with FP
emulation).

Assuming that you don't have a corrupted binary, or faulty processor/memory,
then is one obscure possibility. While a user program will not see any
difference between a 11/34 and 11/40 (except for floating point instructions),
the behaviour after a memory management fault IS different. The non ID space
processors (11/23/34/35/40/60) don't have a register to record the changes
in the general cpu registers after a fault, and it has to be calculated in
software. The 34 and 40 leave the registers in different states after a fault.

The classic example is "cmp -(sp), -(sp)" to extend the stack. This may generate
a fault because the stack needs to grow dynamically. The kernel extends the
stack (where automatic variables are allocated), and then attempts to 
reexecute the instruction. In the case of a 34 using a standard m40.s,
it sometimes gets it wrong, and is very program and data dependent.

Does this ring any bells with people having ported unix to 11/34's?

That comment made me go through and scan my old AUUGNs for some articles
written by Dave Horsfall [who is on this mailing list]. I found his
article on porting V6 to the 11/23, but not for a port to the 11/34.

However, at least two tar files in the UNIX Archive have an m34.s in them:

Applications/Shoppa_Tapes/usenix_80_delaware.gz:
	delaware/maryland/os40/m34.s

Applications/Shoppa_Tapes/usenix_80_delaware.gz:m34.s:
	toronto/case/sys/conf/m34.s

The first appears to be modifications to V6, I haven't checked the latter
yet. It may be something worth pursuing.

I have actual code on how we handled this in those days; who wants it?

Mail it to me and I'll drop it in the archive somewhere.
Thanks Dave!

I have moved the 11/34 patches into the UNIX Archive at

	PDP-11/Bug_Fixes/V7_on11-34

They look like V7 patches though, so they may not be readily
usable on a V6 system. Those other files I mentioned may be
better. Your mileage may vary :-)

Dave, did you write an AUUGN paper for an 11/34 port, and what year
so I can go back and have another look.

You can usually disable the HALT on break feature. When the console is on
a separate serial card :-

DEC	DLV11-E or F	Remove jumper on wire-wrap pin H

DEC	DLV11-J		wire-wrap pins X-B enables boot on break
			wire-wrap pins X-H enable halt (ODT) on break
			nothing on X disables both

Webster	WQDHV		switch 4 at J9 OFF to ignore break.

For processor cards with serial ports, I only have a manual for 11/23+. DEC
is pretty consistent, so there should be options on 11/53 and latter 11/73's.

11/23+	KDF11-B?	Remove jumper from J5-J4 and connect J3-J4
			The jumpers aren't marked on the PCB, so looking
			at the board with the Qbus fingers at the bottom,
			handles at the top, there is a vertical row of
			three jumpers on the right hand side of the board.
			towards the bottom. Top to bottom is J5, J4 and J3.
		
If anybody has manuals for 11/53+ and the quad slot 11/73's and can send me
the details, I'll collate the information, and add it to my web page at :-

	http://www.psych.usyd.edu.au/pdp-11/

The 11/53+ I have does have lots of jumpers, but no numbers or letters beside
them.

Vol 1 No 6.  "Implementing UNIX on a PDP-11/34" (sub-titled: "What does
the `F' in "RK05-F" really stand for ?").

I still have the nroff source available...  It's about 1983-ish.

Dear All,
I now have one of these but the tape hub locking mechanism is acting up.  Has
anyone got a set of the maintenance docs for a TS05 that they can scan for me?

Regards

Robin
