Certainy is Doug. Next time you e-mail in, I'll set you as being able to
post without a subscription. I forgot when I let your first 2 e-mails thru.

Where can we get your reassembled fragments?!

I'm glad I don't have to rebuild the s1 fragments :) Thanks!

Damn, oh well. I should have a look at 5th Edition to see if "ed" is
in C by that stage, or still in asm form.

Probably, but it's hard to tell. We don't have any early assembly stuff
which would date from the 11/45: it's the s1/s2 tapes, then the early
C compilers, then the "nsys" kernel which just predates 3rd Edition.

We'd love to get a copy. I started on a disassembler myself...

Shall do.

Thanks again Doug.
