Hmmmm.  Curious.  I looked at the conf for GENERIC and it had all the
disks.  Maybe I need to build a kernel under SIMH and then move it over
to the real box.  Should be a trip, I've never built a kernel under 2.x.
Wonder how close it is to todays BSD's where I do it al the time.

Yup.  Had RSTS on it when I got it and I tried RT-11 from an
RL and was able to init Packs, copy files and even boot as a DU.
HA LI from the RSTS Startup reports iit's offspring as RA8x disks.

The same kernel mounts all 4 RL02's under SIMH.  :-(

Maybe I need to crawl in back and check out everything.  Could the
terminator getting knocked loose cause this??  It's interesting that
it isn't a particular drive that doesn't whow up, it is the highest
numbered unit.  Unless I am looking at this wrong.  Do the numbers
assigned by the Unit Plug coincide with the dev number or does it
just assign devices sequentially for each drive it sees?  In other
words, if I had a unit with a 0 plug and a 3 plug would that show
up as /dev/rl0 and /dev/rl3 or as /dev/rl0 and /dev/rl1?
Hope that's understandable....
