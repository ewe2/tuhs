When I talk about DECtape in my capacity as the local old fart, i describe
it as "a disk with one track and about 1500 small sectors that spins ve-ry
ve-ry slow-ly..

&gt; <br>
&gt; 9-track could write more files than the directory could=C2=A0take.=C2=
=A0 =C2=A0So for <br>
&gt; many years, people would use the ar(1) program to take a number of fil=

=C2=A0 <br>
&gt; Then the tree would be written with tp, when you read it, you reversed=
 <br>
&gt; the ar(1) process.=C2=A0 If you look at the USENIX/Harvard tape on the=
 TUHS <br>
&gt; you&#39;ll see this scheme in use.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; BTW: tp was written in assembler and all the data structures were usin=

&gt; PDP-11 binary formats.=C2=A0 Eventually, Harvard wrote stp (super-tp) =
in C=C2=A0 <br>
&gt; (which is on the USENIX tape Warren has in the archives) that worked <=

&gt; like the original assembler tp but also put a redundant directory at t=

&gt; USG created cpio (and volcpy) as part of the PWB 1.0.=C2=A0 =C2=A0Like=

&gt; It turns out while it seems to have been unintended, Ken&#39;s origina=
l V7 <br>
&gt; implementation has an interesting coding feature/bug which turns out t=
o <br>
&gt; be what clinched the deal.=C2=A0 =C2=A0When Ken creates the directory =
block for <br>
&gt; each file, he did bcopy of 0&#39;s to the buffer before he wrote that =
data <br>
&gt; that fills it in.=C2=A0 Then when he calculated the checksum for the <=
br>
&gt; directory header block, he summed the entire block (which because of t=
he <br>
&gt; bcopy was zeros).=C2=A0 This means if you write beyond the end of Ken&=
#39;s <br>
&gt; original header and include that extra data in the chksum, the origina=
l <br>
&gt; program will ignore the new information but accept the directory block=
 <br>
&gt; as valid.=C2=A0 i.e. he had built an extension mechanism into the tar =
on-tape <br>
&gt; format.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; cpio&#39;s ASCII on tape format was not able to do that as the checksu=
m used <br>
&gt; a sizeof(header struct) in the checksum routine.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; USTAR was born ... Ken had written things like the UID/GID as ASCII <b=
r>
&gt; representations of the integer value in the original header.=C2=A0 UST=
AR <br>
&gt; added the ASCII representation of the username and the group name sinc=
e <br>
&gt; that was more often portable between systems than the numbers.=C2=A0 =
=C2=A0There <br>
&gt; were other additions like more room for the pathname new file types <b=
r>
&gt; /etc/.=C2=A0 But the key is that a USTAR tape can be read by the origi=
nal V7 <br>
&gt; (and follow on) tape formats, although may not recognize all the <br>
&gt; filetype or use all of the new information.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; A few years later during *.2 discussions, we finally got into the user=
 <br>
&gt; interface stuff and pax(1) was born.=C2=A0 Knowing my hack with car, K=
eith <br>
&gt; Bostic, Jim McGuiness and I wrote up a description of a program that <=
br>
&gt; could with both users interfaces scheme.=C2=A0 USENIX provided funding=
 for a <br>
&gt; student to implement it and put the sources out on comp.unix.sources a=
t <br>
&gt; some point.=C2=A0 That proposal was originally accepted at the first t=
ape <br>
&gt; user interface program in *.2 [a few years later after I stopped being=
 <br>
&gt; part of the committee, the USG folks did get an alternate CPIO format =
<br>
&gt; accepted and cpio as an allowed program.=C2=A0 =C2=A0USENIX paid to ha=
ve the <br>
&gt; program updated to operate like cpio if it was called that, pure V7 ta=
r <br>
&gt; if called that and if pax, user USTAR].<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &#39;nuf said ... I hope.<br>
