Message-ID: <199811260154.MAA08304@henry.cs.adfa.oz.au>

All,
	I've just received another 5 SCO Ancient UNIX license details in the
mail, bringing the total purchased from SCO to 101. I think that's pretty
impressive. Just thought you'd like to know.

Cheers all,

The following exchange recently took place on comp.sys.dec.micro/
vmsnet.pdp-11/alt.sys.pdp11.  In it, I made the guess that PRO Venix
is based on 2.9BSD - does anyone know more details about its heritage?

The PRO 380 Time-Of-Year clock has two modes:

1.  BCD mode, where the year is stored in two decimal digits.
2.  Binary mode, where the year is stored as at least 7 bits (more
    likely 8 bits - it's been a couple of months since the changes
    were implemented the fix in RT-11's PI.SYS, PIX.SYS, and
    SETUP.SAV to make it Y2K compliant.)

When in BCD mode, 31-Dec-99 rolls over into 1-Jan-00, and the
clock keeps accurately ticking.  Venix evidently chokes on this
and doesn't interpret "00" as "2000".

As Unix is incapable of representing times internally outside
the range 1970-2038, the obvious fix is to interpret BCD years
in the range 70-99 as being in the 1900's, and the BCD years
in the range 00-38 as in the 2000's.  This is, for example,
how BSD2.11 interprets the two-digit 11/93 or 11/94 clock year.

Of course, finding the sources to Pro 380 Venix to implement
the changes may be difficult.  The PUPS archive has a version of 2.9BSD
patches for the Pro, and if you're lucky Venix may be close
enough that you can use the Pro-specific clock sources to patch
your kernel binary.  In the 2.9BSD Pro patches, the clock
code is in "/sys-dev/prostuff.c", and begins:

/* These two fuctions handle the pro 300's clock
 * This code is defunct at the end of the century.
 * Will Unix still be here then??
 */

There probably isn't much BSD lineage in Version 1 of Venix,
but there is some in Version 2.  Probably mostly in the form
of the usual add-ons like VI.

There's some confusion about this (at least in my mind), so any
authoritative info would be interesting.

First of all there's:

"Venix/Pro" from Venturecom, which is definitely of AT&T lineage,
probably V7/SysIII for V1 of Venix/Pro, and perhaps a bit of
BSD stuff mixed in for V2 of Venix/Pro.  This is what you find at
Internet archives.

Then there's:
"Pro/Venix" from DEC, which is a repackaging of Venix/Pro.  Again,
there are Versions 1 and 2 of this.  I have V1 and docs for V2,
but no disks for V2.

I'd really like to find a copy of the distribution of DEC
Pro/Venix V2, if it's legal (and having the Ancient Unix license
would seem to make it OK for at least the AT&T side). 

For Pro/Venix, V2, the manual entry for
"clock(7) - time-of-day clock" is:

/dev/clock refers to a time-of-day, battery-backed-up clock.  This
device node is provided primarily for the benefit of the date com-
mand, which will read from it given the -l flag (usually done on
system start-up), and write to it if a new date is set.
...
struct clkbuf {
	int clk_sec;	/* second (0-59) */
	int clk_min;	/* minute (0-59) */
	int clk_hour;	/* hour (0-23) */
	int clk_mday;	/* day of month (1-31) */
	int clk_mon;	/* month (0-11) */
	int clk_year;	/* year (00-99) */
	int clk_wday;	/* day of the week (Sunday = 0) */
	int clk_yday;	/* day of the year (0-365) */
	int clk_dst;	/* non-zero if daylight savings applies */
};

So, it looks bad at least from the internal representation of the
year.  Since I don't have this version, I can't comment on exactly
what happens.

Hi Tim,

| The following exchange recently took place on comp.sys.dec.micro/
| vmsnet.pdp-11/alt.sys.pdp11.  In it, I made the guess that PRO Venix

There are several folks with vastly better knowledge on this than I, but
should they not speak up, I'll mumble on what little I know.

Venix is an outgrowth of V6 UNIX I believe - from my fadding memory of
the little I played with it, the file system is definitely V6 based (with
the notion of "huge" files, i.e. the index pointers would switch from
direct to indirect, while I believe V7 took a much better approach).

The 2BSD branch I believe took a much later fork, V7 or later?  It also
played a more central role than Venix I expect, contributing a goodly
amount of later PDP-11/UNIX based things that others borrowed (e.g. Ultrix
3 from DEC took csh and vi among other goodies).

Gee, I didn't think there was one "UNIX" in the world 8-)  How big are
your integers?  Do you use signed or unsigned values for the epoch since
Jan 1 1970?  It seems hard to believe anything in the UNIX world of today
has this limitation.

I'll agree there is likely just the one "RT-11" though 8-)

I agree - and would love more definitive information (Or, even
better, the sources to Pro/Venix.)  I've
learned an amazing amount about segments of the Unix lineage
just from the comments in the past week, but the gaps in
my knowledge still loom large!

It's entirely possible that Pro/Venix uses the Pro
clock in BCD mode - it looked to me that the 2.9BSD version
does it in binary mode.

It depends on what you want to call "bad".  It's quite possible
to build a Y2K compliant system out of non-Y2K compliant
components!

2.11BSD's date(1) was patched for Y2K in such a way that "00" in
the two-digit year would be interpreted as the year 2000.  (See
patch #327 for the details.)

Would similar fixes for more historic Unices be useful to the general
folk here?

It's "bad" in the sense that the evidence available (empirical,
and sparse code) suggests that the software (and probably the
hardware) is working with only two-digit years.

You could, of course, try to remedy the Y2K problem by properly
handling the clock.  But the evidence suggests that the
problem may be spread over lots of code.  As you say, it would
be nice to have the Pro/Venix code (as opposed to the Venix/Pro
code).

DEC's Pro/Venix is more flexible than Venturecom's Venix/Pro.
You can write and link custom device drivers with the kernel
in Pro/Venix.  There is some hope you could actually "fix"
/dev/clock, but this probably isn't enough to solve the whole
Y2K problem.

Again, any knowledge about the whereabouts of even the binary
distribution disks of DEC's V2 Pro/Venix would be great.
