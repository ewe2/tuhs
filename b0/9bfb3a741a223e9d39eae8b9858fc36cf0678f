In the ITS files from 1990, I have found two C compilers:
- C10 by Alan Snyder,
- and an incomplete port of KCC.

The KCC files seem to be from the late 80s.  Alan Snyders thesis is from
1973 and mentions the PDP-10.  So I wonder C10 if went from MIT to CMU
and Stanford, or if there's some other compiler which came to MIT?
