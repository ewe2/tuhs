What do you mean by "old unixes"?  32V or 4BSD would be trivial.  2BSD
or V7 (or earlier) would be virtually impossible.  gcc was born in a
32-bit world and there's no way you will get it to work natively on a
16-bit host (though it does have a PDP-11 backend):  Both the code and
data structures assume a large memory space and are not amenable to
using overlays.

If you really wanted to run gcc on a PDP-11, the easiest (though very
slow) solution would be to build a simple 32-bit virtual machine that
runs on the PDP-11 and run gcc within it.

As far as I can tell, C99 was deliberately designed to make it
impossible to build a simple C compiler.
