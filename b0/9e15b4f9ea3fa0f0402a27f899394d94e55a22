That might account for the "#", but not for "#!" taken together.
Having two different people invent the shebang independently (as opposed
to *implementing* it independently, as has happened many times -- 8th
Edition, SVR4, Linux, etc.) is just too improbable for me to swallow.

No, I meant that bash does what ksh does: uses itself, which means that a
shebang-free script runs differently on bash, ksh, dash.  This is IMHO
unfortunate.

Good point.  IMHO the Posix sh definition should be extended so that all
shells claiming Posix-compliance should do shebangs.
