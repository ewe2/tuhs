I think it's useful to have both I/O and memory views for files.
Things like commands that work equally well whether stdout is a disk
file or something like a pipe wouldn't work so well in a system where
disk files can only be accessed through a memory-like interface.
However, I guess the I/O interface could just be implemented with
library functions rather than real I/O syscalls for disk-like files.

Maybe I could try doing something like that in my OS but I'm not
completely sure if it would affect performance because it will be
QNX-like, and reads and writes would probably require the VFS to act
as an intermediary sometimes whereas that wouldn't be the case with
I/O since reads and writes would otherwise map onto kernel message
passing without any intermediary servers.
