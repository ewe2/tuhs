I was wondering, what was the /crp mount point in early UNIX used for?
And what does "crp" mean? Does it mean what I think it does?
It is only mentioned in V3 it seems:
./v4man/manx/unspk.8:unspk lives in /crp/vs   (v4/manx means pre-v4)
./v3man/man6/yacc.6:SYNOPSIS /crp/scj/yacc  [ <grammar ]
./v3man/man4/rk.4:/dev/rk3      /crp file system

I suppose scj, doug or ken can help out.
