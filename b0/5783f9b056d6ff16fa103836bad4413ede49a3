No, I don't think there's anything going back this far, e.g. no
`pickup.c' in git, and I think David Levine, another maintainer, along
with you and me, would like to expand the collection as he often looks
back to understand the present.

Clem, if you do dig out old MH source then please point the
https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/nmh-workers list at it, or me
directly if you'd prefer.  Amongst nmh's current users is its co-author,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Shapiro, and I don't think he has
source that old otherwise he'd have passed it on.
