No. Records implemented at a layer above that of the bare system calls (or,
in the case of datagram-oriented protocols, coordinated between two layers
sandwiching read()/write()). That seems very Unix-like to me: consider
ndbm, Berkeley DB, etc. The point is that the interface as exposed by the
kernel doesn't care.
