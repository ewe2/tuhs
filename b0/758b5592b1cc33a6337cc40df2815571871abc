compressed (gz), the entire v7 tape 3.5MB. The compressed (gz) source is
250k. Uncompressed tape is 11.5MB while the source is 1.1MB.

gcc 7.2.0 compressed (gz) is 105MB. gcc/doc directory is 13.5MB:

% tar tvf gcc-7.2.0.tar.xz gcc-7.2.0/gcc/doc | awk '{a += $5;} END {print
a;}'
13,470,317

So yea, gcc 7.2 manual is larger than the v7 distribution tapes.
