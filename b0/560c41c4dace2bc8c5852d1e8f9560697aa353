Subject: [pups] PDP11/73, RD53, RX50... What are my options?
Message-ID: <NGBBLOGBLKMCHGGMCNGNCEKNCKAA.toby@russellsharpe.com>

Hi,

I have a micro PDP11/73 equipped with an RD53, RX50 and a Cipher mag tape
drive (untested). The machine currently boots into TSX (although I don't
have usernames/passwords so no shell access).

I'd like to get BSD2.11 onto the machine. What is going to be the best
route? I assume that my chances of breaking through TSX security (so I can
use kermit) are small, so is vtserver going to be the easiest method?

Toby
