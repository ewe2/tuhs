that's our problem - we don't have AOS/VS installation tapes, this
is very strange. we only have DG/UX installation tapes, but the 
system itself use AOS/VS ... :(

the main problem is :

- how to do a full disk backup of the actual system, and
- how to RESTORE IT back in the eclipse having a working AOS/VS
  again!

really we don't know how to do this; we can't find informations about
AOS/VS, the only manual is Phrack Magazine #44 :( 

the best is to have AOS/VS installation tapes - where can we search for
them ? 

BOOOH :(

now we are studying AOS/VS, maybe in the next days we can offer free
access to the machine (it's the main goal of our lab: let people use
those old computers; we have 2 digital VAX/VMS online now, it's our
idea of having a "working" museum :)
