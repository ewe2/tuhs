Kok Chen's work was the basis for the Greg Titis compiler. It wound up on a
bunch of DECUS tapes, but never seems to have taken off (Greg seems to
think as many as 20 copies existed in the wild). I heard from him off list.
He started with the kcc compiler, then rewrite the scanner, parser and
code-gen, leaving behind just the interfaces. Sadly, he lost all copies he
had in a flood in maybe 1988. He recommends the latter-day kcc as well as
being the best compiler to use if you want to have a more purist
experience. gcc on tops-20 just feels wrong, even to him (he's spent the
years since then doing various compiler things for Cray).

Anyway, just another bit of trivia for this wonderful thread.
