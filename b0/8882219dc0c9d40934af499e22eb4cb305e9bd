I don't recall that particular case, but AIX was definitely derived from 
AT&T code. See 
https://notes.technologists.com/notes/2017/03/08/lets-start-at-the-very-beginning-801-romp-rtpc-aix-versions/

HOWEVER, when the 1983 transition happened and AIX became a primary site 
effort (as discussed in the cited reference), there were those new to 
the effort and new to Unix that thought they could redefine behaviors 
inappropriately.

For example, I recall one person trying to enforce only one root login 
at a time. Larry made it quite clear to that person that we were not 
going to violate Unix tradition in that manner.
