At this risk of putting too fine a point on it, the stdio library was
released in the wild before V7 or UNIX/TS *et al.*

To answer Ed's question, it came out of Research, but first as part of the
typesetter support - *i.e.* 'Typesetter C', which was on V6 and PWB
1.0 [the new troff replacement was being written by Brian] .  The C
Language and associated libraries in the 'Typesetter C' release maps to the
compiler described in the original K&R book.  Dennis explains this in his
paper:  The Development of the C Language
<https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html>.

*"Lesk wrote a `portable I/O package' [Lesk 72] that was later reworked to
become the C `standard I/O' routines. In 1978 Brian Kernighan and I
published The C Programming Language [Kernighan 78]. "*


I have the Lesk paper, as PDF (which I have not idea where I obtained).  I
did a quick google search and could not find it for download, so if you are
interested, send me an e-mail offline and I'll pass you a copy.

I've forgotten when 'enum' and 'void' got added (which are not in the white
book - Steve Johnson or Doug may remember).   But, I think they were in the
V7 compiler, and not Typesetter C.
