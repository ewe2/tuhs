That is true.

Yes, it should error out or implement the stuff i think.  The way
it is is not handable.
The comments in coreutils/cat.c are postable in this thread too:

/* Rob had "cat -v" implemented as a separate applet, catv.
[That is Rob AT Landley DOT NET]
 * See "cat -v considered harmful" at
 * http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/doc/84/kp.ps.gz
[This server has been killed]
 * From USENIX Summer Conference Proceedings, 1983
 * """
 * The talk reviews reasons for UNIX's popularity and shows, using UCB cat
 * as a primary example, how UNIX has grown fat. cat isn't for printing
 * files with line numbers, it isn't for compressing multiple blank lines,
 * it's not for looking at non-printing ASCII characters, it's for
 * concatenating files.
 * We are reminded that ls isn't the place for code to break a single column
 * into multiple ones, and that mailnews shouldn't have its own more
 * processing or joke encryption code.
 * """
 *
 * I agree with the argument. Unfortunately, this ship has sailed (1983...).
 * There are dozens of Linux distros and each of them has "cat" which supports -v.
 * It's unrealistic for us to "reeducate" them to use our, incompatible way
 * to achieve "cat -v" effect. The actual effect would be "users pissed off
 * by gratuitous incompatibility".

And, indeed sailing (-vet explicitly compiled in):

  ?0[steffen at essex busybox.git]$ echo −e | cat -vet
  M-bM-^HM-^Re$

Then again, you know, i personally have problems with -vet and
think the POSIX sed variant is easier to grasp:

  ?0[steffen at essex busybox.git]$ echo −e | sed -n l
  \342\210\222e$
