	Novell Challenges SCO Position, Reiterates Support for Linux

PROVO, Utah � May 28, 2003 � Defending its interests in developing services to
operate on the Linux platform, Novell today issued a dual challenge to The SCO
Group over its recent statements regarding its UNIX ownership and potential
intellectual property rights claims over Linux.

First, Novell challenged SCO's assertion that it owns the copyrights and
patents to UNIX System V, pointing out that the asset purchase agreement
entered into between Novell and SCO in 1995 did not transfer these rights to
SCO. Second, Novell sought from SCO facts to back up its assertion that certain
UNIX System V code has been copied into Linux. Novell communicated these
concerns to SCO via a letter (text below) from Novell� Chairman and CEO Jack
Messman in response to SCO making these claims.
