Version 5.x supported the Pro325/350.  I assume the 380 also worked.
They did the emulation for the screen. IIRC they did VT52 console support
so K52 worked.  I don't think they added VT100 support.

The Pro was a pretty nice RT box.  Too bad they didn't use that instead of
the annoying menu driven POS.

Venix for the Pro was a free download on the net when I last looked.

It's still mentioned here as a download.
