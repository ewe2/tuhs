Hi. I have a small question for you.

I'm trying to figure out a way of getting the MSCP driver from Ultrix
available for porting to NetBSD.
The problem is that it's (c) by Digital, now HP.

Does anyone know of any persons who were involved in the old days when
code was exchanged between BSD and Ultrix? Those people might be a good
starting point for getting code today as well I suspect.

Does anyone else around here have any good clues on this?

Could I be lucky enough that Ultrix actually have been released?

And I'm talking Ultrix-32 here, not Ultrix-11.

	Johnny
