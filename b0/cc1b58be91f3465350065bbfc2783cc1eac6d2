Subject: Why is csh `restricted'?
Message-ID: <199901050442.PAA10444@henry.cs.adfa.edu.au>

I've got a questions that's been niggling me, and perhaps someone might
be able to answer it.

The csh was first released in 2bsd, and came with the copyright notice:

/* Copyright (c) 1979 Regents of the University of California */
/*
 * C Shell
 *
 * Bill Joy, UC Berkeley
 * October, 1978
 */

But my memory tells me that, back in the late 80s, people were saying
that the sources to csh were not freely available. And in the tcsh FAQ
(taken from tcsh version 6.00), I see:

	4.  Where can I get csh sources? 

	Csh sources are not public domain. If you do not have an AT&T V3.2
	source licence or better, you are stuck.

So, can anybody tell me if, when and how did the sources to csh become
restricted, or if not, how this urban legend arose??

Many thanks in advance!

	Warren

	It is not that they "became" restricted.  They always "were" restricted
	because they were derived from the original Bell Labs (later AT&T)
	sources (code borrowed from /bin/sh).  All UNIX sources were, up until 
	you negotiated the deal with SCO, restricted.

	For a long time you either had a multi-kilodollar source license
	or you didn't run UNIX at all.  The binary distributions came a bit
	later.  Initially when 'csh' was being written you had to have a
	source license.  Typically you'd pay (if memory serves) $25k or so
	(quite a chunk of cash in 1979) for a WesternElectric license, park
	the tapes in a rack and send a copy of the license and a check for a 
	few hundred dollars off to UCB to get the software you really intended 
	to run ;)

	You'll note that the copyright lacks the "may be redistributed ..."
	clauses that we typically associate with UCB software.  The famous
	UCB style of copyright ("copyrighted but redistributable") came
	later.

I didn't know that any of the sources in 1979 2bsd were contaminated with
AT&T sources. I'll go and do a line comparison between V6 sh, V7 sh and
the 2bsd csh, and see if I can find any signs of contamination.

What else in the original 2bsd is contaminated?

Thanks!

Steven is right. An investigation into the csh from 2bsd shows that it
is derived from the Mashey shell in 6th Edition UNIX, but not from the
Bourne shell in 7th Edition.

Hmm, I'll have to go and update my UNIX family tree now.

	Indeed they were.  ALL sources were considered "contaminated" or
	restricted - that's why for years and years the only 2.x (and 4.x) BSD
	sites were universities or other companies that had source licenses.

	Anything that I (or other contributors) didn't write ourselves.

	A good case can be made that stuff ported from 4.4-Lite is not
	contaminated (because 4.4-Lite had the legal blessings of AT&T)
	but I was told at one time anything based on the Net-2 stuff could be
	(is?) contaminated.  Alas by the time 4.4-Lite came out the software
	had bloated so much that very little of it can be ported over.  I 
	grabbed a few ideas and pieces out of the kernel - that's where the 
	"sysctl" stuff in 2.11 came from for example.  But the mainline
	applications are GNU based (megabytes and megabytes of memory assumed).
	I'd like to see someone getting GCC to run natively on a PDP-11! <grin>

	That's why the SCO "Ancient Unix" license is such a milestone event and
	is so important (perhaps more so than some folks realize).

	Up until this point you had to have a US$100K budget to gain access
	to the software we can legally obtain for $100 (no 'K') now.

Just a thought: much of the stuff in 16-bit Minix was written by people
on Usenet and donated to Minix. The core stuff of course is owned by
Prentice-Hall, but there are some freely-available programs.

	It might also be a good time to clarify that the sources are still
	'restricted'.  Legally we can share the sources only with other
	license holders.  However the cost of obtaining the license is vastly
	more affordable now than in a previous era.

	Hmmm, didn't the V7 shell borrow from the V6 shell?  Perhaps not
	completely "based on" (as in starting from a copy and editing away).

No, from what I heard Bourne nearly started from scratch. I did have
a copy of some old Usenet news from John Mashey about the v6 shell; I'll
try to dig it up.

There has been a lot of confusion on this point.  Well, maybe
``disagreement'' would be a better word.  Obviously Net-2 contained
almost only stuff written by contributors, though there was, indeed,
some code which had obviously grown out of Seventh Edition code.  I
think somebody mentioned something like 13 files in the context of the
lawsuit.  I took a look at one (kern_clock.c?), and confirmed that
yes, it looked as if it was derived rather than written from scratch.
On the other hand, there was nothing which AT&T (or the opponent of
the week) could claim to be trade secrets.  And IMO none of this could
have been construed to mean that people couldn't use the sources which
were indisputably completely written by UCB and its contributors.

	I'd heard it was 7 files at one time, then 11.  It's a fairly
	small number _but_ the exact list was never disclosed (part of the
	settlement I understand).  Without a list of files the fear (at the

	files those were it was hard (impossible) to know what you could or

	I'm not a lawyer (and don't even play one on the Net;))...  That's
	how you and I (nonlawyer types) think.  The sentiment at the time

We can agree (or is that defuse?) about that.

Well, here's an extract from BSDI's announcement dated 8 Feb 1994:

OK, so it was 16, not 13.  And yes, they didn't say that these were
the ones, but I did look at one and saw the similarities.

Well, some things just keep changing.

INet Dunce Cap firmly attached, in case my greymatters are vaporware....

I though I remembered seeing in one of the varieties of the 386BSD-0.0,
386BSD-0.1, FreeBSD-1.1, FreeBSD-1.1.5.1 (don't ask where, because I
really don't remember exactly), a subtree with a README and the original
7 files (yes, I counted them and it was 7).  Now, that makes me want to
backtrack to find that and see what exactly was different.  Vague memory
suggests it may have been in the 1.1.5.1 suite, since that was about the
time of the great territorial Unix Wars of old......

That was where the shift from the 1 release level to the 2 release level
came in.  Sadly, I was not really paying much attention to it all going
by on the net back then, since I was tied up in AIX boxen.  But, I did
run across that interesting subtree and those 7 magic files, one time.
Now, where DID I see them......

I am glad it all came to pass.  But, it is still fun to peruse the odd
bits here and there, and sometimes real history or insights pop up.

If all goes well, another minor bit of history may pop up shortly.
With the graces of Dennis Ritchie, I rekeyed in the V1 manuals in
roff source, in case anyone still has a model KSR37 sitting around
with a box full of paper, roff, and too much time to burn.  It is complete,
now, but needs some editorial fixings since the OCR came through rather
bad.  I made the suggestion that he allow us to put a copy in the UHS
archives.  It may appear on his web page when the editorial fixings
get done, and hopefully, minnie, too.

OK, Dummy here stuck his foot in his choppers an' won the bid on that
VAXen for the grand total of eleven buckeroos de realme.  What can I
run with it?  It was just too much fun to pass up, and it drew too many
chuckles from the PC crowd in the surplus warehouse....(:+}}....

Machine:  VAXstation 3500, no consoles or external boxes, only the tower.

Tape Drive:  TK70

Hard Drive:  RA70

Boards:

SLOT     BOARD NUMBER   DESCRIPTION

12       (empty)

What are the above boards, for reference?

What boards are needed to bring up the machine minimally and test it out?

How should one fire it up the first time, without blowing it up?

I am working with the original owner of the beast to see if he may have
a box of odd manuals and hopefully tapes still in storage somewhere.
If not, I am at ground zero with it.

I am assuming it will have to be run headless, via an old VT-52ish
Zenith terminal I have, or a Kermit with VT-100 emulation.  I don't
have the main color monitor for it, or the mouse and keyboard.
What is the pinout of the silly MMJ connector on the CPU?
Will a plain terminal work OK?

What kinds of printer can be hooked up to it, via what protocols?

What is the best way to network it into my local home ethernet coax?

Any suggestions are appreciated.

Thanks

Bob Keys
