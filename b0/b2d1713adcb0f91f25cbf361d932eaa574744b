Today we restarted our Apollo Series 400 with Domain/OS SR10.3.5
that is perfectly working as 5 years ago, when we stored it into
our deposit... There are some pictures here:

We are planning of putting it online for some hours in a week if
someone want to play with it...

Sorry for the italian language in our main site, we're working
on an english version (and also fixing a lot of things about the
site) so please be patient, we hope in a few days we will have
an international version!
