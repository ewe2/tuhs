No. NetBSD has ELF and shared libs. The later saves space but involves
some overhead. When it comes to compiling NetBSD looses. NetBSD uses
GCC. GCC is _very_ slow. GCC 3.x is even slower. 4.3BSD-Tahoe /
Quasijarus uses pcc that is _much_ faster in compiling. I did a "make
world" of 4.3BSD-Tahoe on a KA655 based MicroVAX III and it took a day
or so. I would not even try this with NetBSD (as I have much faster NVAX
machines for this).

The thing with NetBSD is that you get a modern *ix like OS complete with
ssh etc. and features like mmap(2) that 4.3BSD-Tahoe doesn't have. If
you are running a VAX emulator on PeeCee hardware you can use the
exelent cross compile features of NetBSD to cross build kernels on your
PeeCee. (Or Alpha, PowerPC, UltraSparc, ...) You don't even need to run
NetBSD on the compile host.
