Subject: [TUHS] Happy birthday, Tommy Flowers!
Message-ID: <alpine.BSF.2.20.1612220724390.43538@aneurin.horsfall.org>

Tommy Flowers MBE was born on this day in 1905; amongst other things he 
designed Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic computer, 
which was used to break the German Lorenz cipher (not Enigma, as some 
think).

Relevance to Unix?  Well, without the world's first usable computer we 
would not have the world's first usable OS, and M$ would probably reign 
supreme by now...
