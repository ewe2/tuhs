It's certainly more work than -h.

What I meant (and this is certainly my interpretation) was that
somebody added the -h option because of perceived pain with piping
output through another program.  I didn't intend to imply that it was
the only alternative.

Yes, that sounds like an excellent method.

And yes, I deliberately didn't mention this option, though it occurred
to me.  I have a couple of scripts like this, like:

    alias l="ls -lbL,"

Yes, this is an issue that I mentioned in an earlier message (I added
a positional parameter to work around it).  But this is in the nature
of the output.  mc doesn't have this issue.

Heh.  Never thought of that.  But since -h (apparently) never produces
output with 4 digits, the -, doesn't ever come into effect.  I've just
tried it on some big files, and the -, is effectively ignored.

I don't like the standard output because things like this are hard to
read:

  -rw-r--r--  1 grog  lemis   8234010624 22 Mar  2012 Casanova-TV-1-5
  -rw-r--r--  1 grog  home   13225168900 31 Aug  2019 Movie:_Sahara_2005-2016-04-11-2028

I find this easier to read:

  -rw-r--r--  1 grog  lemis   8,234,010,624 22 Mar  2012 Casanova-TV-1-5
  -rw-r--r--  1 grog  home   13,225,168,900 31 Aug  2019 Movie:_Sahara_2005-2016-04-11-2028

I can't speak for Dave, but this is also less painful:

  -rw-r--r--  1 grog  lemis   7.7G 22 Mar  2012 Casanova-TV-1-5
  -rw-r--r--  1 grog  home     12G 31 Aug  2019 Movie:_Sahara_2005-2016-04-11-2028

The problem for me there is the difficulty comparing lengths, and the
implicit inaccuracy.

Hmm.  In this particular case, so does Linux:

  === grog@bilbo (/dev/pts/11) ~ 2 -> touch "foo   "
  === grog@bilbo (/dev/pts/11) ~ 4 -> l foo*
  -rw-r--r-- 1 grog grog 1499570 Jun 30  2012  foo
  -rw-r--r-- 1 grog grog       0 Mar 12 10:40 'foo   '

I wonder if that's something we should emulate in FreeBSD.  At the
very least we should consider whether the lack of identification of
trailing blanks is a bug in the FreeBSD implementation of -B.  This
option isn't in POSIX, and in Linux it means

     -B, --ignore-backups
              do not list implied entries ending with ~

So maybe it's a candidate for fixing.
