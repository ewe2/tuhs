Thank you Angus for your kind words.

As a reminder, if your current GitHub account is not linked to your past 
Unix contributions, (you can search them through 
http://www.spinellis.gr/cgi-bin/namegrep.pl), associate your past email 
(e.g. clemc at ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU) with your current account through your 
GitHub account settings https://github.com/settings/emails. (Contact me 
for instructions on how to add email addresses to which you no longer 
have access.)

An extended description of the Unix history repository has now been 
published by the "Empirical Software Engineering" journal.  You can find 
my self-archived preprint at
http://www.spinellis.gr/pubs/jrnl/2016-EMPSE-unix-history/html/unix-history.html
and
http://www.spinellis.gr/pubs/jrnl/2016-EMPSE-unix-history/html/unix-history.pdf
(The official version is available through 
http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10664-016-9445-5.)
