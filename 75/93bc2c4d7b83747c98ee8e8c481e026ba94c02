Too bad about impio.c!  Maybe something can be extracted from the
unix.greg binary?  I see there's also the ACC interface, another
alternative to IMP11A.

Since you don't have anything backing the hardware registers for the IMP
interface, it seems likely something will be upset.

It's complicated.  Many of the utilities have parallels between the two,
and some work on both.  And there's a server to provide a gateway from
Chaosnet to Arpanet.  Give me a ping when you're looking into ITS.

Reviving the host software, like you are are doing, is one vital part of
it.  Another it adding emulators for various IMP interfaces.  I.e. you
will not get anywhere without adding one of IMP11A, ACC, or VDH to SIMH.

For adding other nodes to the network, PDP-10 hosts are your best bet.
There isn't much else left.
