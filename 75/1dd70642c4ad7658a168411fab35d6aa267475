Subject: [pups] Restoring volumes
Message-ID: <000001c30f92$a78292a0$0100a8c0@who5>

Hello again from Gregg C Levine
Just for the sake of an argument, has anyone actually managed to
restore a volume from the collection on the ftp server, back to an
originally sized disk pack? Or for that matter restored a system so
that it behaves as advertised under E-11?

No, folks that machine I "have on order", has not arrived. Once again
I am searching for information for a future project. One that might be
happening sometime this week, or even later this month.
