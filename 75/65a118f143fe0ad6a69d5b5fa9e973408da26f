There was a neat paper out of CERN a few years ago about how they're
turning down their AFS (now OpenAFS) cells.

It seems that the idea of a big, shared, distributed file namespace is
sadly disappearing. I feel like most of the web-based replacements are not
as seamlessly integrated with my preferred toolset as what they're
replacing, but I've also become more and more acutely aware that I am not
the target audience for those things.

Certainly, real-time collaboration via e.g. Google Drive is pretty amazing
and very dynamic, particularly when paired with e.g. real-time video chat,
but it also forces one into a particular model of interaction that I've
spent most of the last three decades consciously avoiding but now find no
escape from.
