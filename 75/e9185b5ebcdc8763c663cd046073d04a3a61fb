I saw that there's a SysIII bj.s, which is almost identical to the 2.11 one;
so the latter is probably descended from the first, which I assume is Bell
source. So I grabbed it and tried to assemble it.

The errors are because bj.s is designed to be assembled along with another
assembler source file, which contains the following routines which are
missing from bj.s:

 mesg
 decml
 nline

Dunno if you're aware of this, but, the line 'as a.s b.s' _doesn't_
separately assemble a.s and b.s, rather it's as if you'd typed
'cat a.s b.s > temp.s ; as temp.s'. (This is used in the demi-enigmatic
"as data.s l.s" in the system generation procedure.)

I looked around in the sources that come with V6, and I didn't see any obvious
such file. I'm going to whip the required routines up really quickly, and see
if the results assemble/run.


I looked to see if I could steal them from the binary of 'bj' on V6, and...
it looks like that binary is totally different from this source. Let me look
into this...

The V6 assembler groks '.even'.
