Well, I figured out how to untar Al's disk (it needs commandline bsd or 
gnu tar -xf, 7zip does NOT LIKE IT), and indeed a later but still very 
similar version of that editor, which is the RAND editor (as mentioned 
here: http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/notes/2006/N2239-1.pdf 
), not restricted ed at all (unless red is based on rand editor, which I 
don't know yet). Hence, RE-SRC (rand editor source) in the russian 
thing. The version on dennis_v6 is older(1975?) than the one on the tar 
Al posted (1982?), but much of the code is nearly the same. The code is 
unfortunately missing quite a few sectors, and some parts of the 1982? 
code were reorganized enough to make reassembling the 1975? code difficult.
