Subject: [TUHS] RT/PC-centric AIX history
Message-ID: <06D4621236AA4E76A87D603786775B68@studyvista>

I've refrained from jumping into AIX & RT/PC discussions on TUHS. It seems 
more appropriate to summarize AIX history than try to correct or clarify 
specifics out of context.

I wrote about 5 pages, got feedback, revised accordingly, and posted at
https://notes.technologists.com/notes/2017/03/08/lets-start-at-the-very-beginning-801-romp-rtpc-aix-versions/.
