    I am running linux and I want to devote a partition to a good working
old version of linux v5,6, or 7. I have Bob's simulator and it works great.
The thing is when I boot v7_rk05_1145 or v7_rl02_1145 which is I believe
Dennis's donations I don't know how to log out of the system. I also want to
make a filesystem for unix and I don't know how to do that with a pdp-11
emulator. I want the source so it can be generated too.
