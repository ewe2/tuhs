Ah. It was so long ago, and I never learned ITS that well. However, I 
don't think you can have several jobs in Tops-10, and I know you can't 
in OS/8 or RT-11.

But that's an interesting capability. To have several jobs around, with 
the memory intact, and you can switch between them, and play with their 
memory.
