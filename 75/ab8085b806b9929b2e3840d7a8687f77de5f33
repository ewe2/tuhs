Hello (again) from Gregg C Levine
I disagree. It turns out that Yahoo is getting worse, and Google,
isn't far behind. The problems that Sourceforge has been having, have
been in most cases repaired. They are still working on cleaning up the
projects that have had little activity within the last one to two
years. But I will accept that we can agree to disagree.
