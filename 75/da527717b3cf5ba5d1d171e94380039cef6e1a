sorry, my previous email was wrong, tap isn't the same as tp.

AncientFS has a tap driver for FUSE:
https://github.com/macfuse/macfuse/tree/master/filesystems/unixfs/ancientfs
- you might be able to use that directly or use it to get information
about the format. I could swear I found a copy of the original archive
program for it at some point, but I don't remember where.
