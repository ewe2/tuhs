It's unsupported; see my email where I pasted the "HCL" from 2.10's 
GENERIC config.

Well, 2.10 has SLIP, but it'd certainly be easier to implement a simple 
userland tool to talk to a frontend!

That I am pretty sure I DO NOT have source for.

That sounds like a neat board.  Betting it's a bit hard to find, though.

I'd check but I'm pretty sure I don't have Ultrix-11 sources. :(

What were you using for paging/swapping on that?
