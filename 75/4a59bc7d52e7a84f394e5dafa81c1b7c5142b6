OK, there are three documents which sort of fall into this class. First,
there is something titled "New C Compiler Features", no date, available here:

  http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=Interdata732/usr/doc/cdoc/newstuff.nr

no date, but it appears to describe an early version of the so-called
'Typesetter C', mentioned in other documents, so this would be circa 1976 or
so.


There is a second document, untitled, no date, which I have not been able to
locate online at all. I scanned my hard-copy, available here:

  http://ana-3.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/history/unix/CImprovements1.jpg
  ..
  http://ana-3.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/history/unix/CImprovements5.jpg

From the content, it seems to be from shortly after the previous one, so say,
circa 1977.

Sorry about the poor readability (it looked fine on the monitor of the
machine my scanner is attached to); fudging with contrast would probably make
it more readable. When I get the MIT V6 Unix tapes read (they have been sent
off to a specialist in reading old tapes, results soon, I hope) I might be
able to get more info (e.g. date/filename), and machine-readable source.


Finally, there is "Recent Changes to C", from November 15, 1978, available
here:

  http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/cchanges.pdf
  
which documents a few final bits.


There is of course also Dennis M. Ritchie, "The Development of the C
Language", available here:

  http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/chist.html

which is a good, interesting history of C.


    > Also, I have started a note with a list of 'issues with C when you're
    > backporting V7 and later code to V6'

I found several documents which are bits and pieces of this.

  http://ana-3.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/history/unix/C_Backport.txt
  http://ana-3.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/history/unix/V6_C.txt

Too busy to really clean them up at the moment.
