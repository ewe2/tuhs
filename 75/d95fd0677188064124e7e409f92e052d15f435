AT&T STREAMS and research streams (note difference in case and specificity
of origin) were two separate things. v8 would have had the latter; you are
presumably referring to systems using the former. It is unsurprising that
bugs in the two would, in many cases, be disjoint: that is, the bug you are
referring to in AT&T STREAMS quite possibly wasn't in the research streams.

All modern shells use such an integrated history editor....

There is considerable difference on the meaning of "modern" with respect to
this facility in recent shells, but this isn't the place for a holy war.
