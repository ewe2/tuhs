Well, there can be a huge spectrum here, isn't there?   Ranging from:

* Take the code wholesale with no changes.

* Take the code and make changes to match with local coding style.

* Take the code and serially rewrite it so when you're done it
  only vaguely resembles the original contribution.

* Look at the code, get the ideas, and the reimplement it from
  scratch, keeping the existing interface (or using the existing
  interface as a starting point before extending it)

* Look at the code, get the ideas, and reimplent it from scratch
  with radically different interfaces.

It sounds like all of these were used to some extent as part of the
BSD/CSRG integration process; is that right?
