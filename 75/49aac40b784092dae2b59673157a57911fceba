Right. The relevant section in the article that started this thread says:

: Al Aho decided to put theory into practice, and implemented full regular
: expressions (including alternation and grouping which were missing from
: grep)and wrote egrep over a weekend. Fgrep, specialised for the case of
: multiple (alternate) literal strings, was written in the same weekend.
: Egrep was about twice as fast as grep for simplecharacter searches but was
: slower for complex search patterns (due to the high cost of build-ing the
: state machine that recognised the patterns).

The "putting theory into practice" refers to compiling the regex to a DFA,
rather than interpreting an NFA.

Russ Cox has a good summary of differing regex implementation techniques
at https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html

This makes me wonder how well-known was the technique of compiling to a
DFA, and whether it was widely implemented before awk, egrep, and lex.
