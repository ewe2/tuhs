Why wouldn't you just cache all the entries for the terminal once and for all? terminfo never came to 16-bit systems anyway, so we're talking about systems with plenty of memory. Caching the terminal information would not be a big memory cost.

BSD solved this problem that way: parse /etc/termcap and put all the entries into termcap.db. :)
