My language of choice is C, and has been for a decade and a half.

I write some really FUGLY C code when I need to get down and dirty, like 
in my emulators - though they're not OO by a longshot, they're written as 
sort-of modular, one of them has an emulation of a 6847/6883 which is 
implemented in clearly marked functions, but the functions are terribly 
coded.  Comments are sparse, and usually only mark where I needed to 
actually think about what I was doing.

I implemented a couple Unix commands as part of a never-finished project - 
I wanted to write a userland for a Unix clone, where the utilities could 
also run on MS-DOS.

(...something like "Does DOS have the Unix nature?" "Mu!" comes to 
mind...)

-uso.
