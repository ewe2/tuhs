That may be coloured by your perspective.  C was never designed to be
portable, while much older languages like Algol and Cobol were.  There
were quite different reasons for C's success.

To quote "The Programmer's ABC'sâ from Datamation, April 1976:

  C is for Cobol
  What a pity
  It was designed
  By a committee
