File Systems                                           devfs(7FS)

NAME
     devfs - Devices file system

DESCRIPTION
     The devfs filesystem manages a name  space  of  all  devices
     under  the Solaris operating environment and is mounted dur-
     ing boot on the /devices name space.

     The /devices name space is dynamic and reflects the  current
     state  of  accessible  devices  under  the Solaris operating
     environment. The names of all attached device instances  are
     present under /devices.

     The content under /devices is under the exclusive control of
     the devfs filesystem and cannot be changed.
