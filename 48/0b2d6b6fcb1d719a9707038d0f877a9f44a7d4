Aww shucks; I actually kinda like enums. When creating sequentially
numbered constants, they're convenient.

That said, the typing issues I have a lot of sympathy for. For true
constants, it's a shame that `const` didn't make it in earlier, though we
have it now. Abusing enum to define constants certainly feels like, well,
abuse.
