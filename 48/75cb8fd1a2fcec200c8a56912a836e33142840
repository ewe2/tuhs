Yes, it's the same spec, though reimplementated; there was no BCPL
compiler for the PDP-11.

I edited the v7 manual and I believe I proofread every man page. How
could I have overlooked the misbehavior of the .li request*, which was
even then not in the reference manual's list of n/troff requests? On
closer examination, .li does appear in a condensed alphabetical list of
requests--and it appears in the source. But if Joe never described it,
it's no surprise that groff dropped it. It is totally unnecessary--a
bit of special pleading rendered obsolete by Joe's elegant invention
of \&.

* .li causes the next line to be read literally, even if it begins
with a dot.
