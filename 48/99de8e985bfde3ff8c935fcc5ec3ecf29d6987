â€‹Right and it's probably worth digging up the v6 version of fsck.  I had it
on tape but I worry that it might be 800 bpi which I have lost the ability
to read.  I need to find a working TS08.

Also remember for early UNIX, ps "knew" about some kernel data structures
and had to compiled with the same sources that your kernel used if you want
all the command field in particular to look reasonable.

I've forgotten when that got fixed, my memory is that V7 still had vestiges
of that issue i.e. it was not until post 4.1BSD that got ps got more
independant.   That said, until V8 and /proc that user mode utilities like
that got really cleaned up.
