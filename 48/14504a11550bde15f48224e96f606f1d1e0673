A pox on both their houses, IMO.  And apparently the SCO vs. IBM
lawsuit is still alive.  The situation is almost farcical.

Back in the 1960s IBM was facing two antitrust lawsuits over alleged
attempts to use its dominant market position to freeze the HPTC market
while they attempted to complete and ship the long-delayed System/360
model 90.  One lawsuit was brought by the Justice Department and
famously dragged on in court for a decade.  CDC also filed a civil
lawsuit.  CDC's lawyers built a computerized database of all the IBM
internal documents that they found during the discovery phase of suit.
IBM and CDC settled out of court.  IBM gave its Service Bureau
Corporation subsidiary to CDC and agreed to stay out of the service
bureau business for 10 years.  CDC agreed to destroy the database of
IBM internal documents.  The Justice Department tried but failed to
get access to the CDC database for their own lawsuit.
