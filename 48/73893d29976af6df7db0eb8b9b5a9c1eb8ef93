​Amen​.   BTW:
I really don't consider Solaris a pure System V ​either.  Larry and his
siblings hacked on it pretty heavily.    SGI's Iris and NCR's RAS were much
closer to "pure" Summit code and that was not "Research" UNIX.   They all
devolved.

​Ditto.   To me, anything post First Edition of Research UNIX is UNIX.
Where hacking started and was slowly changed.   But the core BTL DNA was is
left intact.    Idris, Linux, Minux, etc. were clones, where the API was
followed and the DNS regenerated.

​Either way, it really does not matter too much.
