Hmmm. It's been a while since I ran 2.11, but I'm pretty sure you should
see something about the controller at boot. That it attaches, it's csr and
what vector it will use. The same way you observe the RL11 controller.

Seems like you don't have the controller available from the OS.
Have you used the controller anywhere else, so that you know it's
functioning, and that the CSR is set right?

About the RL drives, I guess we'll just have to assume that you don't have
more than two units generated in the system, unless you have some very
funny hardware problem.
