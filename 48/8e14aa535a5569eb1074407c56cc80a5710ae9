Yes, but it doesn't have cross links as far as I know.
What I have in mind is effectively one more entry in
the root. Call it "union" perhaps. In a leaf of that
tree, say /union/usr/src/cmd/find, will ne a page that
links to all the "find sources in the other systems.

I don't know the range of topologies in the Unix Tree.
For example, some systems may have /src while others
have /usr/src. That could be hidden completely by
simply not revealing the path names. Alternatively
every level in the union tree could record its cousins
in the various systems, as well as its children
in the union system.
