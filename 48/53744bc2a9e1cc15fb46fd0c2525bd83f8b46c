If you haven't seen it, check out Ken Thompson's brilliant paper on
compiling regular expressions.  The date was 1968... In effect, he
built a JIT to do regular expression searches (on an IBM 7094, no
less!).

The earliest reference is a paper by Kleene in 1956.   In fact, I
recall that * was sometimes called "the Kleene star" in the day...

 So when were REs first designed and implemented? I would imagine that
 they came about as a way to extend the old '*' and '?' wildcard
 syntax, but that is only a guess.
