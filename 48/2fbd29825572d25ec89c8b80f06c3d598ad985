I was going to write a proper DC-11 device for Simh, but Tim's patch to
the DL11 was so small that I decided it would be easier to allow runtime
configuration of the DL11 to behave like a DC11. I've just added misc/DL.diff
to our subversion tree. If you apply this patch to Simh, then you can add
these lines to your simh.cfg to make 8 DC-11 devices:

set ttix en                             ; Enable DC/DL-11 device
set ttix lines=8                        ; We want 8 serial ports
set ttix address=17774000               ; Set the address to be a DC-11
set ttix carrier=dc                     ; Turn on the DC-11 carrier detect bit
set ttox 7b                             ; Set output to be 7-bit, lowercase
att ttix 5555                           ; Attach serial ports to telnet 5555

I hope we can get the change into the Simh tree.

Cheers,
