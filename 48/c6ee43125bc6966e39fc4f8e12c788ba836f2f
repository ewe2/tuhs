As already mentioned: If I add comments at the end of the lines it
works:
cn      1 176540 344    5       cnrint  cnxint  # kl/dl-11 (on mvx11-aa)
cn      2 176550 354    5       cnrint  cnxint  # kl/dl-11 (on mvx11-aa)
cn      3 176560 364    5       cnrint  cnxint  # kl/dl-11 (on mvx11-aa)
cn 1 csr 176540 vector 344 attached
cn 2 csr 176550 vector 354 attached
cn 3 csr 176560 vector 364 attached
Sounds like a funny bug? 

But if I try to use /dev/ttyl1 I get a message about a unknown interrupt
and the output of /dev/ttyl1 hangs after the first character.

I have a M3106 DZQ11 that I can use instead.

The DHV is a DEC M3104:
dhv ? csr 160440 vector 310 didn't interrupt.
The DL11 card is a clone made by Sigma.

Noticed that already. I am really not used to Unix stuff of that age.
