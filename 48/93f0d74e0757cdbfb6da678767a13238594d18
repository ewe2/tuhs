Subject: [pups] Looking for some common switch settings...
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10103221425150.31709-100000@weasel.ciswired.com>

Does anyone have handy the switch settings for DEC PDP-11/44
memory boards?  I have a collection of third-party boards
(nat. semi and standard memories) but no documentation on
them.

I suspect they use the same dip settings as DEC MS11-xx (M8743)
boards (of which I also have a few but no docos).

I'm also looking for DZ11 (M7819) IRQ/CSR switch settings.

Thanks!

Has anyone been able to create and install a tape made from the:

ftp://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/PDP-11/Distributions/ucb/2.11BSD/

directory? I've built the tape as described in the readme file
and went back can checked it with a hexdump and it appears correct.
Tried booting with the sputnik and E11 sims with no luck:

PDP-11 simulator V2.3d
sim> set cpu 1m
sim> at tm0 c:\211.tape
sim> b tm0
000002 (HALT)
sim>

I've been able to boot other tape images with no problem. Any ideas
would be very appreciated.

Kirk

ps - A dump of the boot tape FTP'd or Email'd would be very-very
appreciated.

I am using an 11/83 with an Emulex UC07 Qbus-SCSI card.  At present I have a
Seagate ST4767N disk attached.  The emulex card emulating an MSCP drive I
believe.

I am sure I could also find a higher capacity drive without too much effort.

Which disk should I tell the Ultrix installation I have to get the best from
my setup.  I made an 'educated' guess of RA81 for the moment, and that
works.

I could physically attach a drive with a much higher capacity than DEC ever
envisaged, but which drive do I 'pretend' I am using.

Many thanks



Kevin Murrell

Did you use makesimtape to create the tape image? If not, that's
probably the problem.

Couldn't find the manual for the M8743, but I managed to dig up the manual
for the M8722, MS11-M. Let me know if you want the settings for this
board instead.

I looked really hard on our internal network for an electronic copy of
this manual but I couldn't find it so I'll try to make an ACSII drawing of
it..

Yeah, if you could.  Haven't heard anything from anyone else on the
M8743.  Thanks.
