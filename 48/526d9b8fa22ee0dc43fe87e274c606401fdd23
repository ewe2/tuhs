Thanks for the link. Let me ask a follow up question. Supposing I created a byte faithful representation of a V6 filesystem on my mac, would I then be able to load the file in simh as an RK05 and mount and access its files and directories from a V6 instance? If I need to post in the SimH list, let me know.
