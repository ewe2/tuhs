Message-ID: <Pine.SUN.3.91.980228130910.18727B-100000@lintilla2.df.lth.se>

Synopsis:
I am trying to install an RLV12 and an RL02 drive under ULTRIX so that I
can generate RL02 disks from the emulator software in the PUPS software 
library. The ultimate goal is to have a machine where one can copy bootable
systems to people who do not have any vintage UNIX but have the hardware.
However!
There sure is a great fat wall to bump into here....

First try was a uVAX-II that is a part of my collection of vintage
machines.
This rig runs Ultrix 4.2 (with updates).
Here is the system messages when booting the GENERIC kernel:

Loading (a) vmunix ...
sizes:
text = 719932
data = 116224
bss = 398512

real mem  = 7335936
avail mem = 4779008
using 179 buffers containing 733184 bytes of memory.

hl0 at uba0 csr 174400 didn't interrupt
hl0 at uba0 csr 174400 didn't interrupt 
^^^***(Observe! Twice! The darn thing at least pretends to try..)***^^^
klesiu0 at uba0
uq6 at klesiu0 and so on.
The system then successfully loads uq16, dz0, ra0 and tms0.

This is what I did so far:
1) I made a system configuration file containing only the devices I got plus
hl0 (that is the RL02 driver).
Same effect as above.
2) To rule out that this was something in hardware I built an entire new
machine from scratch using spare parts. Not ONE thing was used from the
original system. I also installed ULTRIX 4.0 to be sure.
Guess what...
When booting the GENERIC kernel, the same thing occured.
During all test:
The RL02-drive(s) were spun up with a scratch disk in them.
On both systems they were set as drive 0 and had terminators.

*despair*

When trying to reach the disk by make-ing a file system on it, the system 
snorts at me telling me to go and fly a kite. Watch this:
# newfs /dev/rrl0a rl02
newfs: /dev/rrl0a: cannot open to read partition table: No such device or 
address
newfs: /dev/rrl0a: cannot open: No such device or address

However, the device files are in place. System just can not find the
board. =/

Any clue anybody? (I know that this is tedious for you all but it is for
a good cause, okay? )

That suggests the interrupt grant chain was not intact.  Look to see if 
one of the slots needs a grant card.  Watch out as a few cards DO NOT
pass grant!

I understand why you would use rl02 they are handy.  I have no experience 
with them in unix context only Qbus VAX (under VMS) and PDP-11s under 
rt-11/rsts/rsx-11 so I can't comment on software setup.

I've had an RL02 working on an 11/750 running
BSD4.3. The RL11 controller only has 16 words of
buffer memory, so you've got to make sure that other
devices don't hog the bus too much. In particular,
UDAs should have their DMA burst set to something like 1.
Setting it much higher causes the RL11 to get data lates
as its silo overflows before it gets access to the bus
to do DMA. However, the RLV12 seems to have a much bigger
silo (256 bytes?), so this should't be a problem for it. 

The only other things I can think of are bus grant problems
&c. If you're using an RQDX3 in the same machine, bear in mind
that it doesn't pass the grants, and so should be the last 
device on the bus.

This certainly seems likely to me, too.  What cards are in the
machine, and in which slots?  What are the switches on the RLV12
set to?

I think you're thinking of the RQDX1/2 here.

In case anyone is interested in the benchmarks, here's a short summary:

Both a Webster ESDC (1 Megabyte cache, Hitachi DK512-12 ESDI drive) and
an Andromeda SCDC (2 Mbyte cache connected to many SCSI devices, including an
"internal" SCSI ZIP) are present on my main development machine, a 11/73
(KDJ11-B) with 2 Mbytes of non-PMI memory.  Caching on both controllers
was enabled and two benchmarks were done with each disk subsystem.  Times
reported below are "wall times".  All of this is done under the latest
release of 2.11BSD using a non-networking system and no other work
being done on the system.

1.  "make sendmail" took 1159.4 seconds on the WQESD+Hitachi, and 1165.3
    seconds on the SCDC+ZIP.

2.  "find /usr -print > /dev/null" took 166.4 seconds on the WQESD+Hitachi
    and 165.0 seconds on the SCDC+ZIP.

It looks like, for most purposes, the ZIP on a good SCSI host adapter is
just as good as an ESDI drive on a good ESDI controller.  I think
Steven was expecting to see a substantial hit due to the ZIP's access time,
but I think that the buffering in the host adapter and in the ZIP drive
itself makes this a minor concern.

Grant chain was intact on both machines.
On the second machine the MSCP device was placed below the RLV12 and the 
RA disk worked fine!

Both systems have "pirate" drive controllers and they have cards
that do pass grant signals.
If I do not remember wrongly, I think that only RQDX-1 had the
"feature" of not passing the grant chain.
But we placed all RQDX controller at the bottom anyhow even
though they worked further up.
THis is of academical interest only since I do not have holes
in the grant chain and do not have an RQDX controllers AND
I have devices below the drive controller in the first case
that do work!

For various reasons I can not give you the hardware config of the
first system (Okay okay! I DO not want to crawl back in behind it 
under all the cabling and short out the house again because I did 
something aggravating to the power outlet in the process the last time
I was in there) but the only thing I did to that one was to add the RLV12 at 
the bottom. The system worked before with all devices and did so afterwards 
too except for the RLV-controller.

The second system looks like this:
  A	  B	  C	  D
1 CPU-----CPU-----CPU-----CPU
2 MEM-----MEM-----MEM-----MEM
3 RLV12---RLV12---RLV12---RLV12
4 TKQ50---TKQ50   DQNA----DQNA
5 SI------SI------SI------SI
GLUED BACKPLANE FROM HERE AND DOWN
(this used to be a VAX-station II.
Remember them and cringe!)

SI is a quad ESDI controller for one or two external drives from System 
Industries.
On the other system I have a dual SI controller for RA81 clones (Eagle).
There I DO have an RQDX-3 above the RLV12 but not so here.
Grant chain on the uVAX bus looks like this:
1AB-2AB-3AB-4AB-4CD-5CD-5AB(and so on).
The first three slots are "granted" only in the AB pair.
The RLV12 does work with grants only on the AB pair however.
It works fine in my three button 9 slot 22 bit backplane (classical
PDP11 vintage rack mount cab) and there the grant chain goes ONLY
on the AB side stright down (BA11-N and H9273).
So, no, I do not think we have a grant problem.

However, does the RLV12 handle drive interrupt like the RL11 does?
It could be that ULTRIX only supports the UNIBUS controller and
not the Qbus.. And if so, is there a fix for this out there?
And if not, how do I get hold of enough NetBSD to get a uVAX up
enough to have the config above, being able to network and being able
to reach both the SI controller and the RLV12?
Come to think of it, most of the no nonsense hard hat industry type
PDP11's I've seen (and especially the OEM-ed ones) got some sort
of winchester emulating one or several RL02s. Often combined with some
sort of QIC-type tape recorder with secret density.
To get ANYTHING on those rigs, I think you HAVE to do it the dd way
after having moved the controller to a bigger system....

Amazing how things can turn...
I used to spend a lot of time in trying to get away from the 16 bit
operating systems into the wonderful world of 32 bit. Now I am struggling
even harder to get back in there again. =)
Fun is not always bigger, faster better!

Ah, the "RC" aka "restricted configuration" aka "resin-coated" backplane.

The BA23 has a special CD-bus in the first three slots.  Usually it's
not a problem to put a full-height card in the third slot, below
the CPU and memory, but occasionally there are quad-height
cards which actually pay some attention to stuff going on the CD
side of the bus.  Can you try rearranging your cards so that you
have a dual-height card (i.e. the TKQ50 or DEQNA) in slot 3 AB,
you have the 3 CD empty, and the RLV12 in slot 4?  This involves you
giving up either your TKQ50 or DEQNA, but I'm hoping that you can
live without one or the other for a little while.

Also, how are the jumpers/DIPswitches set on the RLV12?  It's possible
to do some weird things by sticking the RLV12 into 16-bit or 18-bit
mode or by having the VEC set to something used by one of your other
cards.  If either of these is the case, regard the fact that the controller
isn't usable as a Good Thing; having a RLV12 in 18-bit mode splatter
data all around low memory isn't fun!

Hook up 6 other SCSI devices to the board and you might change your mind!
The SCDC also supports standard 34-pin 5.25" and 3.5" floppies.

Actually, the ZIP "in-use" LED wasn't lit during most of the 'find'.  I
suspect the Andromeda SCDC cached most of the important inodes quite
early on.

In terms of raw bandwidth to the Q-bus, nothing I've ever seen comes
close to the SCDC.  2 Mbytes/second may not be a whole lot by modern
PCI bus standards, but on the Q-bus it's very impressive.

> 	Wasn't there mention somewhere of a 200mb Zip?

I've heard mention of it too, but AFAIK it's still vaporware.  100 Mbytes
is, indeed, pretty tight for a 2.11BSD distribution, but it does fit.

I don't know anything about larger Zip drives but Syquest makes the
EZFlyer 230MB which is compatible with the EZFlyer 135. I got one for
Christmas and love it. I _believe_ it's a bit faster than the Zip.

The EZFlyer data sheet is at http://www.syquest.com/products/d_ezflyer.html
in case anybody is interested.

All,
	re the question `Are CD-ROMs the best method of distributing the
PUPS archive of PDP-11 UNIX material'? The answer is: it's a good method, for
the following reasons:

	+ you can't easily write over the CD-ROM
	+ impervious to magnetic fields
	+ the PUPS archive is always going to be changing, as I find and
	  add new stuff to it.
	+ the SCO license enforces that I get written permission before I
	  pass anything to a third party. Taking this in a conservative
	  fashion, this might rule out a password-protected ftp archive.
	  However, I'll check with Dion at SCO on this.
	+ we can only charge fees for copying and distribution, and cannot
	  make money on the CD-ROMs

Therefore, treat the archive CD-ROM like you would the FreeBSD or Linux
distributions on CD-ROM: they will go out of date, but you can purchase
new versions of the CD-ROM, and they should be relatively inexpensive.

Ok, so CD-ROMs are not the _best_ method of distributing the archive, but
they are a _good_ way of doing so.

Ciao,
	Warren

I still miss the distinction between CD-ROMs and WORMs.  CD-ROMs are
relatively expensive in small quantities, not just because of the
setup costs, but also because of the wastage involved.  WORMs
(writeable CD-ROMs) are probably a better choice for the anticipated
volume.

Sorry, my fault. I use CD-ROM to mean anything which can be read in a CD-ROM
drive. That obviously includes CD-W, which is what I really mean here.

I'd say at least 100 initially, and at least 300 in the first 12 months.
I'm trying to organise a bunch of people who can burn CDs, to keep the
individual workload down.

I'll be creating a Rock Ridge image using mkisofs from the archive here.
People who are prepared to burn CDs can either download the image, or the
entire archive. For the latter, I'll include a makefile to build the CD image.

Oviously, people who do mirror the archive:

	+ will be asked to burn CDs, and will do so,
	+ must be covered by a license. I will need either a signed
	  letter (on paper) describing the license, or a PGP-signed
	  email describing the license, before I can give access to
	  the archive.

Does this sound reasonable, everyone?

As I mentioned before, I can cut tapes, but not burn CDs.  I think
this is still a valuable service.

Right.  Any further news about when this could happen?

Modulo my point above, yes.

 Apologies again, Greg. Yes cutting tapes will also be valuable,
 esp. for people who have a PDP-11.

> Right.  Any further news about when this could happen?

 No, I'm waiting on feedback from Dion. He did say he had started the
 process of making it a product, but I don't have an ETA for it at the
 moment.

 Many thanks again for volunteering!!

All,
	To show you what I'm thinking of for the CD-ROM version of the
PUPS archive, I've put the unlicensed parts up for anonymous ftp at:

	ftp://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/pub/PDP-11/PUPS_Archive/

I've kept the directory structure intact, but you won't find any files
that require a source license. I'd appreciate any comments. Note that
there's a directory called Trees missing. It will contain `exploded'
trees for v6, v7 and 2.11BSD.

The Lists directory is interesting: it contains tar vtf listings of all
tarballs in the archive, with added checksums so you can determine identical
files in multiple tarballs.

This is all rough cut at the moment, so don't treat anything as unchangeable.

	Warren
