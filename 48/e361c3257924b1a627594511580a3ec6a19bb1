 |All, sorry that this is tangential to TUHS. I work at TAFE Queensland, \

 |server
 |over 25+ years. However, TAFE wants this to be verified by third parties:
 |
 | "Where possible the teacher could show that industry endorses his

 |really helpful!

To me TUHS is an invaluable source of data and knowledge context,
especially with utree.pl i have worked many hours.
I know it also as been used as a knowledge base to fill in the
gaps in order to create correct ".Sh HISTORY" manual entries in
BSD land.

 |Cheers & thanks in advance, Warren

Thank you in return very much indeed.
