Subject: [TUHS] TUHS Mail Archive is now searchable
Message-ID: <20151214003425.GA31555@minnie.tuhs.org>

All, I've finally set up a search system for the mailing list.
It's at http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/mailman/tuhs.cgi
and it's also hyperlinked on the main list page at
http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tuhs

I've not yet set up a cron job to keep it updated, and yes the
interface is ugly but it works.

Cheers, Warren
