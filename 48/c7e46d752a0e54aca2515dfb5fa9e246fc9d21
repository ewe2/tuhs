Subject: [TUHS] Open Sourcing IRIX?
Message-ID: <57FF0370-6EC5-4282-BCB2-06DD34C3C2B1@mac.com>

Since SGI is EOL'ing IRIX at the end of the year, has anyone asked  
them if they would donate it's source ( under some sort of OSI  
license of course ) to the UNIX archive?

Or is there too much SysV code in it?

It would be cool to have easy access to the older IRIX versions for  
older SGI hardware.
