I have indeed watched "Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource
Sharing"[1] again today, at least in parts, after i heard that
Paul Allen died.  And John Postel died exactly twenty years ago,
i have read his name a thousand times.

 ||An email from someone on a related topic has reminded me of someone \

 ||J. C. R. Licklider; we lost him on June 26, 1990.
 |
 ||He didn't write much code himself, but the work of people he funded (e.g.
 ||Doug Engelbart, the ARPANet guys, Multics, etc, etc, etc) to work on his
 ||vision has led to today's computerized, information-rich world. For \

 ||only know today's networked world, the change from what came before, \
 ||and thus
 ||his impact on the world (since his ideas and the work of people he \
 ||sponsored
 ||led, directly and indirectly, to much of it), is probably hard to truly
 ||fathom.
 |
 ||He is, in my estimation, one of the most important and influential \
 ||computer
 ||scientists of all. I wonder how many computer science people had more \
 ||of an
 ||impact; the list is surely pretty short. Babbage; Turing; who else?
