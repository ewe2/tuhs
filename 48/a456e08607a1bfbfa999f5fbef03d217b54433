Subject: [TUHS] Ken visits Cray Research Inc and finds old bug
Message-ID: <CAP6exYLgXZ3inuXZ_AHSo2i=d_pECA0R6vs61XCtitySf+HFjQ@mail.gmail.com>

There's a story I heard once in supercomputing circles from the 80s, that
Ken visited CRI in Minneapolis, sat down at the console of a machine
running the then-new port of Unix to one of the Crays, typed a command, and
said something like "ah, that bug is still there."

Anybody know what the bug was?
