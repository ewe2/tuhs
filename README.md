TUHS backup
===========

This is just a backup for my personal use in case I ever get my local archive
messed up. It's comprised of the [public-inbox archive of
TUHS](https://inbox.vuxu.org/tuhs/). Be aware that the backup strips messages
of the post-mark necessary for maintaining an mbox format. In that case it's
simpler to grab the ``mbox.gz `` file for the specific thread from their
archive than mine.
