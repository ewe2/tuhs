And now we're working on ed, which assembles and runs, but has bugs.

This might be a strange request, but does anybody know of a "Teletype
simulator", a graphical program that acts like Telnet but prints characters
in a typewriter-ish font and "clacks" when they are printed.

I thought it would be nice to get a feel for what it was like to
use a real tty; I only used glass ttys (ADM3a, VT100s and so on).

Cheers, Warren

P.S Linux/BSD version preferred of course.
