And perhaps even less so when MS-DOS picked up a few of Xenix's features 
for 2.0 (mainly file i/o with Unix-like semantics, but FIND was a 
stripped-down version of "fgrep", and several of the new commands in 2.0 
were certainly derived from Unix...or even BSD), although to anyone who 
actually knew anything, that's about where the similarity ended.
