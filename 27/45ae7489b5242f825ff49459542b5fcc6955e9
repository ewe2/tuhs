Yeah, it's been hashed out in this thread.  I think originally it was
for a C/A/T thingy, then somebody did a DVI which a virtual thingy
with "drivers" for each target thingy, and then there was a pay
version for postscript and then groff.

Or something like that, if you read through this thread it's been
hashed out pretty hard.  And over on the groff mailing list they
are putting the history in a man page going all the way back to
RUNOFF.

Loving the interest in roff, it's my favorite for writing papers
or docs.  Have developed a bit of a taste for asciidoc for simple
stuff for the web.
