Ha! I have been struggling for a way to convey some questions I have in 
a way that would lessen the amount of assumptions baked into the answers 
(Sometimes when I ask questions, what I get back sounds to my ears a lot 
like, just load the frigglewump into the carbathingamajig and boot 
normally). Then I thought, how would I have asked the question if it the 
situation had come up in my real lab. I'm sure the scenario was not 
period accurate, but apparently it was close enough to spark some very 
helpful answers. Thanks for not dismissing the thread as frivolity.

Well, interestingly enough. I find using v6 to be quite fun and one step 
closer to some primal tech place :). I'm sure y'all have seen Mills's 
winning Best in Show IOCCC entry:

https://www.ioccc.org/2018/mills/hint.html

and the actual 'code':

https://www.ioccc.org/2018/mills/prog.c

Somehow, this sorta thing just jazzes me.

Well... writing code might be a stretch, but certainly playing around in 
code is fair. The developer'd be me :)

Fantastic, I'm prolly gonna try it.

Interesting, I had no idea. In the simulator, speed is rarely an issue 
with the types of programs I've been messing around with so far, so I 
hadn't noticed it.

Nice. Definitely a worthy project then. If the instructions in Setting 
up are as good for the 45 as they are for the 40, I should be able to 
bring one up relatively painlessly. This is one of those assumptions I 
was talking about - I knew that I could just add CPU=11/45 in my SIMH 
ini file and be running an 11/45, and separately, I knew that I could 
build 11/45 code in Unix v6. But, I didn't getÂ  how this fit together. 
What it sounds like is that Unix was transitioning from non-I/D land to 
I/D land and maintaining a measure of backward compatibility not unlike 
Mac OS from PPC to Intel, or 32bit to 64bit?

Fascinating. Definitely will keep this in mind and hurry the transition 
towards the 11/70.

Yeah, Cole already mentioned this in a separate thread. I'll file it in 
the keep in mind drawer.

This is really helpful. Is there a bootable tape of the MIT system extant?

Oh my, what's that you say about frigglewumping the carbathingamajig? :)

This would be great. Right now, stuff is pretty much pell-mell and 
difficult to find, much less use.
