I don't see any reason why you can't make that optimization at that point.
Nothing is going to come in and suddenly invalidate the inode between those
two lines.
I suspect it was an example of cut/paste-it is from some other part of the
kernel.

Subject: [TUHS] V6 UNIX main() oddness

So, while bringing up V6 on a hardware PDP-11/23 with an RK11 emulator using
an SD card for storage which Dave Bridgham and I are doing, I found this
piece of code in main() on V6 Unix:

	rootdir = iget(rootdev, ROOTINO);
	rootdir->i_flag =& ~ILOCK;
	u.u_cdir = iget(rootdev, ROOTINO);
	u.u_cdir->i_flag =& ~ILOCK;

I don't get why two separate calls to iget(), with the same arguments; why
not replace the second pair of lines with:

	u.u_cdir = rootdir;
	rootdir->i_count++;

What am I missing?
