Several comments spring to mind:
One - closed-source proprietary software development is a minefield waiting 
for the unwary;
Two - open-source development is self-administering as far as "contributions" 
goes, and we generally don't need people to go through on a similar "find the 
haystack -in-the-needle" search;
Three - there is usually a group of people willing to do this sort of work - 
voluntarily - as the Groklaw example shows us, so it's often more an inertia 
thingee than anything more serious.

And last but hardly least, given the rise of the law-suit residual company, 
etc, opening the source of such orphaned systems may become a necessity, 
because law-suits such as the SCO example, will succeed if the law in general 
is kept ignorant of computer history, etc.  In that case, opening the OSF1 
source tree would pay dividends in peace of mind.

Just some thoughts.
