It would've been early Linux for me, but some personal issues stopped me 
from actually doing it (all I had to do was to collect the box -- a 386 -- 
that someone else had done for me) otherwise I would've learned to loathe 
Penguin/OS that much earlier :-)

As it was, $BOSS paid for my BSDi source licence, and when WinDriver 
bought them out and suppressed it I went to FreeBSD instead (after a brief 
tangle with some pompous OpenBSD jerks).

FreeBSD is still my main server (an ancient P4 at the moment, with a 
massive 512MB of memory; it used to be a Celery w/ 128MB) with MacBook and 
Debian clients.  And I really must repair the keyboard on the EeePC 701 
(running EeeBuntu) some day...
