Subject: [TUHS] PDP-11, Unix, octal?

The mainframes of the 60's and 70's all used 6-bit characters (and
often different encodings for the non alphanumeric characters).Â  So
the Unix folks, including me, had experience with octal long before
Dec.

 Something I've been meaning to ask for a while: why Unix and octal on
the
 PDP-11? Because of the DEC documentation?
