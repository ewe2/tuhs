Yea, the dates on the files in the archives say January 10 -> March 28th in
79...  It makes a lot of sense that they started a year or more earlier...

Looks like 3BSD was cut in March 28th 1980, so that fits. Most of the work
appears to end sometime over what would be that Christmas break (judging
from file dates), with bug fixes continuing through March...

Which matches the 3BSD release....

That's totally cool! The key missing bits were that 32/V work started
before 7th Edition was finalized. This is way more detailed than I
expected...

Thank You!
