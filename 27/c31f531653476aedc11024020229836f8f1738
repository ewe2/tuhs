gnu ls does not follow this convention. The system V sources one can find
on the internet have the curious code:

#define DOTSUP  1
...
                        if (aflg==0 && dentry->d_name[0]=='.'
# ifndef DOTSUP
                                && (dentry->d_name[1]=='\0' ||
dentry->d_name[1]=='.'
                                && dentry->d_name[2]=='\0')
# endif
                                )  /* check for directory items '.', '..',
                                   *  and items without valid inode-number;
                                   */
                                continue;

which is the V7 behavior ifdef'd out.

This has been the BSD convention since at least 4BSD :)

But I find this interesting, since the 8th edition was based on BSD 4.1c I
thought....

And system III and later all have the above code.

It looks like, from the source, to be a blip in V7.
