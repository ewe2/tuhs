I got copied of the cover and front page off-list. Thank you!

I have a rough draft of around 63 slides. I have a maybe around 10 more 
to add. It is too much content for an hour. Temporarily they are at
http://reedmedia.net/~reed/pres/.tmp-ibu4txv873cv/
pdf is 63 slides at ~5MB
(please don't distribute as I didn't yet cite sources in it nor have 
re-use statements for some images I borrowed.)
J.tex is the source for the pdf.
The real source is the notes in the .data file there. (It is a mess.)
I plan to add a few photos of the earliest participants (as named in 
the research edition manuals.)
I will add a few pages about Berkeley Unix up to 3BSD. (Later will do 
one hour talk just on BSD.)

Few questions:

If using a 4.5 inch diameter roll of paper for the TTY, how did you cut 
the paper into 11 inch pages? Or did you just let it roll up?

Anyone have a pointer to the photo of a Graphic Systems (GSI) 
phototypesetter (1973)? (for troff v3 slide)

Was patent department that first used Unix on PDP-11 and roff (~1971)
same department that would later handle Unix licensing two years later? 
(~1973)

Anyone have a pointer to a picture of GE 635 or 645 system? (for multics 
slide)
