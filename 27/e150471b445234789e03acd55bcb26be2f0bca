When Digital Systems Research Lab started in 1984 after the implosion of =
PARC CSL, the first machine we built was a 68000 (68010?) version of the =
Firefly multiprocessor.  We were able to score some MicroVAX II chips =
soon enough that we redesigned using those, which was, ahem, more =
politically astute at Digital.

Only a few 68K versions were built.  The Firefly supported a Unix/Ultrix =
system call interface but otherwise used unrelated software.

(Funny story about close(2).  The initial version raised a Modula-2 =
signal when you tried to close an already closed file, which was very =
slow.  The OS folks, unused to Unix, had no idea that was something you =
do all the time.)

Regarding the SUN-1 design, I had heard a rumor that it was designed =
using TTL =E2=80=9Ctypical=E2=80=9D propagation delays rather than worst =
case, and as a result was fairly flakey.  This caused me to not join sun =
<very> early since Eric Schmidt had the office next to me.  One of my =
many life mistakes.
