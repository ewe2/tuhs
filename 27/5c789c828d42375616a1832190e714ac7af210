And, FWIW, in one of the few GNUs Bulletins I actually have received, courtesy 
of the FSF, RMS (I think) was advising that with the dropping price in 
memory, GNU hackers could do without worrying about memory size, when it came 
to replicating Unix utilities..

So perhaps that is a point to be taken into consideration?  I know in some 
respects FreeBSD - the only *BSD I've ever gotten around to installing - 
comes across as smaller and faster than Linux.  I hate to think of SysVRx - 
everything I have read about that series of OSes said it was bloated, and the 
SCO SysVR3 I learnt Unix on felt somewhat clumsier than Linux when I first 
got it.  But that's the result of Bash being nicer than sh to a 4DOS user.

Hope this is useful.
