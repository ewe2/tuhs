Subject: [pups] The infamous 2.11BSD patch archive

Hi -

>   What's up with the 2.11BSD patch archive?  I assume that the version

	Both it and the mirror are up and running.   There are quite a few
	netblocks that have portscanned/spammed/whatever me here (dialups
	and cablemodems for the most part) and they're listed in the packet
	filters so if you're seeing timeouts, etc connecting that's probably
	the reason.

	Companies play the "musical domain name" everytime they have a
	re-organization (and, sigh, another one is in the works as I type).
	What was listed was probably a name from the last reorganization and
	of course it's very difficult to track down all the places that an
	old name was used.    

	The mirror I maintain at work is:

		ftp://ftp.cato.gd-ais.com

	(for some time yet it will also respond to 'ftp.to.gd-es.com')

	There may be other sites that also mirror

	Others have done that - usually it's not too bad, especially if I'm
	asleep at the time :)

	Sequence is important because the patches are diffs against the last
	current version of a file.

	Each patch has rather good (if I do say so myself ;)) instructions and
	explainations of what was changed, how to apply, what to rebuild 
	immediately (and what can be deferred until it is convenient).

	Have Fun!
