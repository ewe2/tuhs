The source code for this paper had been available as part
of the System III distribution under the old (unfree) SCO
license.

In case you had applied for that license, and you still
have an old PUPS archive CD at hand, you can find it in
Distributions/usdl/SysIII/sys3.tar.gz.

You will not be able to recover the original layout since
PostScript font metrics are quite different from CAT ones,
but Heirloom troff produces readable output at least.
