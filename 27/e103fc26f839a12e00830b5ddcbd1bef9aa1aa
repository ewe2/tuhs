In my 40-year career as a programmer, I've more than once had that
someone who comes along later be myself.

I also apply what I call the Bus Principle.  If you get hit by a bus
and killed, one of your colleagues is going to have to take over your
work.  Give them a fighting chance with code comments, and maybe even
a design document for large or complex things.

Amen to that!  Good comments are one of the things that distinguishes
Software Engineering from mere programming.
