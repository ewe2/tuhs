hm.. this won't work because the compiler starts handing out registers
the register-declared variables with the highest register possible so
would start with rr10 or so.

I've changed it to:

	u.u_dirp.l = (caddr_t) ((long) (((saddr_t *) uap->linkname)->l) & 0x7F00FFFF);

otherwise it won't compile. It compiles to:

        ldl     rr2,rr8(#4)
        ldl     rr4, at rr2
        and     r4,#32512
        ldl     _u+78,rr4

is it because I added a * and changed . to ->?

this generates:
"sys2.c":305: operands of CAST have incompatible types 
"sys2.c":305: operands of "=" have incompatible types
