whilst looking around the bitsavers.org pdf archive, I
found a document called
PreliminaryUnixImplementationDocument_Jun72.pdf.
Having had a quick scan through, it contains a source
code listing and some commentary (lions i hear you
say). The strange thing is that all of the source code
appears to be in assembler...

whats this about?

is it a comentary of PDP-7 unix?

regards

Martin
