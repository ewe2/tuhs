The Wikipedia page for ISC has the following paragraphs:

"Although observers in the early 1980s expected that IBM would choose =
Microsoft Xenix or a version from AT&T Corporation as the Unix for its =
microcomputer, PC/IX was the first Unix implementation for the IBM PC XT =
available directly from IBM. According to Bob Blake, the PC/IX product =
manager for IBM, their "primary objective was to make a credible Unix =
system - [...] not try to 'IBM-ize' the product. PC-IX is System III =
Unix." PC/IX was not, however, the first Unix port to the XT: Venix/86 =
preceded PC/IX by about a year, although it was based on the older =
Version 7 Unix.

The main addition to PC/IX was the INed screen editor from ISC. INed =
offered multiple windows and context-sensitive help, paragraph =
justification and margin changes, although it was not a fully fledged =
word processor. PC/IX omitted the System III FORTRAN compiler and the =
tar file archiver, and did not add BSD tools like vi or the C shell. One =
reason for not porting these was that in PC/IX, individual applications =
were limited to a single segment of 64 kB of RAM.

To achieve good filesystem performance, PC/IX addressed the XT hard =
drive directly, rather than doing this through the BIOS, which gave it a =
significant speed advantage compared to MS-DOS. Because of the lack of =
true memory protection in the 8088 chips, IBM only sold single-user =
licenses for PC/IX.

The PC/IX distribution came on 19 floppy disks and was accompanied by a =
1,800-page manual. Installed, PC/IX took approximately 4.5 MB of disk =
space. An editorial by Bill Machrone in PC Magazine at the time of =
PC/IX's launch flagged the $900 price as a show stopper given its lack =
of compatibility with MS-DOS applications. PC/IX was not a commercial =
success although BYTE in August 1984 described it as "a complete, usable =
single-user implementation that does what can be done with the 8088", =
noting that PC/IX on the PC outperformed Venix on the PDP-11/23.=E2=80=9D

It seems like Venix/86 came out in Spring 1983 and PC/IX in Spring 1984. =
I guess by then RAM had become cheap enough that running in 64KB of core =
was no longer a requirement and LSX and MX did not make sense anymore. =
Does that sound right?
