Wholeheartedly agree with the observations on forgotten versions, lack =
of source and a smaller pool of people back in the day.

It is not just the Research versions, also the internal AT&T versions =
and the base System V versions get little attention. Same reasons I =
think.

Luckily, these days the sources are available (although in the case of =
SysV of unclear legal status).

Part of the problem I think is that it is not well known what =
innovations are in each version. About 2 years ago I did a lot of =
spelunking through the V8 source and with the help of this list could =
come up with a list of highlights for V8 (text is now on the TUHS V8 =
source web page).

Never had the time to do that for V9. I think it was mentioned that it =
had a new filesystem with a bitmap free list. Also, it seems to have a =
lot of cleaned-up implementations of things that were new and rough in =
V8.

No clue what was new in V10.

Similar with Unix 3, Unix 4 and Unix 5. I=E2=80=99m thrilled that the =
docs for Unix 4 showed up recently. In these doc=E2=80=99s there is no =
material on IPC. =46rom this I think that the IPC primitives from =
CB-Unix did not get merged in Unix 4, but only in Unix 5 (in a reworked =
form).

Personally, I=E2=80=99m still working (off and on) on recreating the =
Reiser demand paging system. To keep it interesting I=E2=80=99ve now got =
Sys III running on a small RISC-V board, and when I find another time =
slot I=E2=80=99ll try to add Reiser paging to it.

So the forgotten versions are only mostly forgotten, not totally =
forgotten :^)
