Subject: [Unix-jun72] svn changes?
Message-ID: <1209645318.5140.974.camel@papa>

Has anything changed regarding read access
to the svn repository? My client answered

svn: PROPFIND request failed on '/svn/trunk'
svn: PROPFIND of '/svn/trunk': 502 Bad Gateway
(http://unix-jun72.googlecode.com)

when I wanted to do a regular 'svn update'
command.
