Even though i have read your message as a maybe even ironic
sharpening, i feel i have to step in and find this hard to
believe.  Maybe there have been technical reasons.  To me micro
micro always an overwhelming experience to receive answers or
mails in general from people of this league, with such names, etc.
This is truly academical spirit.  And you can even make errors, as
long as you can explain why you thought what turned out to be an
error was the way to go.  McKusick?  No...

Well, Matthew Dillon of DragonFly BSD had an initial Meltdown
mitigation in no later but January 5th (and finished on 01-11),
and also posted long explanatory and benchmarking etc. mails.
Later Maxime Villard of NetBSD also posted, a bit cryptic.  Also
on one of the BSD lists, i forgot which, there i saw the link to
the ARM document which was the very best read on this topic in all
that terrible mess of noise surrounding these issues.
So no real need for conversation if the work is done.

I would agree, but i guess it depends on the people whether that

I disagree for the non-software related part.  I am damn happy
that we in Germany have TV under public law.  Where programs of
quality can be made, programs which will never make any money, and
maybe even do not get a price.  Non-trivial programs.
