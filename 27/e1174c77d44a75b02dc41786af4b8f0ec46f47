That's a good point Josh. I've been trying to find copies of UKUUG and
EUUG newsletters to add to the archive, along with the AUUG newsletters.

So if you're on this list and outside of the US, now is the time to
speak up with anecotes etc. Oh, and if you have anything worth adding
to the Unix Archive, please let me know!
