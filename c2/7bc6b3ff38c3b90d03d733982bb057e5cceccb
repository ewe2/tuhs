That was the story of my life running the UNIX machines, not only from DEC and other
service guys but also the manufacturers themselves.    Sometimes I had to bluff and
say i was experiencing the problem with the proprietary OS.     I had to remember not
to use our slang for the other OS’s (both HP’s MPX and Gould’s MPE we referred to
as Might Pour Excuse).
