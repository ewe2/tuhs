i used the fair share schedular whilst a sysadmin of a small cray at UNSW. b=
eing an expensive machine the various departments who paid for it wanted, we=
ll, their fair share.

in a different job i had a cron job that restricted Sybase backend engines t=
o a subset of the cpus on an big SGI box during peak hours, at night sybase h=
ad free reign of all cpus.

anyone did anything similar?

-Steve
