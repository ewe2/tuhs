I ran the 2.11bsd_on_rl02 without problems on bob supnik's emulator. (you need to issue a mount -a command after booting in order to mount the 4 RL02 disk and the 5 RK packs in correct places)

I also ran the 2.11_rp_unknown on bob supnik's emulator and on p11.
It worked fine except that password files were corrupted (and contained unknown passwords)
So I replaced /etc/passwd*; /etc/master.passwd; /bin/passwd and /etc/mkpasswd (which was no present) with the files of the RL distribution

Now it works very good, on p11 emulator under linux 2.2 with networking support.

But does V7 have a MSCP disk driver?  Recommending to someone that all they
have to do is write a driver when they don't even have a running machine yet
is, IMHO, a bit optimistic :-).

Of course, under the Mentec PDP-11 hobbyist program he could install
RT-11 or RSX-11 or MicroRSTS on such a machine quite nicely from a bunch
of RX50 or RX33 floppies he made from the Mentec CD-ROM's.

  See ftp://ftp.dbit.com/pub/putr/

How many RX50's would it take to hold a root filesystem dump?  15 or so?
It's not *quite* as cruel as the RX01 root distribution we discussed over
some Pastrami sandwiches a couple of years back.  But it is approaching the
"Wagner Ring cycle on convenient 45's" stage!

See, it's these sorts of references we need in the PUPS FAQ list.  The
same questions come up every month, I give the same pointers, then everybody
forgets them again, until I answer the same questions the next month :-).

Hi,

is a location known where this may be preserved? This should be
an Algol68S (P.Hibbard) compiler from CMU adapted for V7 Unix in Manitoba.
At least, Andy Walker calls the beast 'Manitoba compiler'. See recent
discussion in comp.lang.misc.

Is it freely available or requires a license? Regardless, I'd be happy
to put it in to the PDP-11/Applications area in our Unix Archive.

Hi -

	Oops - I messed up there didn't I?  Concentrated so much on the size
	of the disk I forgot about the MSCPness of the device :(

	Ummm, as a matter of fact no it doesn't.  Depending what version 
	of V7 you have it may or may not even have an RL driver.

> How many RX50's would it take to hold a root filesystem dump?  15 or so?

	Oh perhaps 8 or 9.  Using RX33 disks it only took 4 floppies but 
	the RX50 is what, 400kb (about 1/3 that of the RX33).

	It's more like just Siegfried on 45's rather than the entire Ring ;)

	Is ftp.spc.edu still up and running?  I know spc11c.spc.edu is out of

	keep running now that Terry's no longer there.
