Hopkins had a 11/45 system with several RK05's (2.4M).   One was / and /usr,
one was /sys1 (one set of users)  and the other /sys2 (the other users).
My initial quota for class was 8 blocks and that went up to 30 when I went
on staff there.

We also had two additional RK05 drives and I thought I was in fat city when
I invested $65 in my own cartridge for that.
Before that, I had spent a few bucks on DecTapes.

The system swapped on an RF11 disk (1024 blocks).
