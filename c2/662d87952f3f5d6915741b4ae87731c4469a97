Clem,

Many thanks for your informative post!

That is great news. Let me know once you had a chance to look at it. I am in no hurry, so whenever you have time, even if that is months from now.

> Diomidis is correct, 4.1a use Joy/Cooper/Leffler reimplementation of of the BBN stack, not the original BBN stack.
I suspected as much, but I am happy to hear it confirmed. I've been told on several occasions that 4.1a contained the original BBN stack.

Eric Cooper took the basic BBN distribution and put it on the UCB 4.1 systems around campus >>before<< Joy started the sockets work i.e. the installation was done by installing 4.1, then taking the BBN tape and installing it as is. 

I can confirm all this. I do have several copies of the BBN tapes from '81 and '82, they survived in Kirk McKusick's archive. They indeed contain material that is 'copied over' a clean 4 or 4.1 build tree. The first complete BBN beta is from May 1981 and Joy started on his network code in October 1981.

> BTW: about 3 years later, the BBN2 stack comes out from Rob and team and it is actually even more interesting; because it now uses the sockets interface (not the Chaosnet/UofI nami trick), and adds a number of both performance enhancements (Van Jacobson's work, etc.) as well as a more complete implementation of the IP stack.   I >>might<< have a copy of that tape squirreled away; but I'll have to look.

I think this might be the material that appears in the BSD source tree in 1985, right? Van Jacobson's work is ~1988, I think, but I could well be mistaken. I think the main performance improvement between the 1982 and the 1985 version was a switch from a kernel thread model to a software interrupt model, but as yet I haven't grasped why this is better and my assumption may be incorrect.
