Well , it seems to be a giant effort You are planning to accomplish.
Because pdp and x86 have different architectures, a lot of new low level
stuff will have to be added.
The same concerns multitasking, multithreading , shared libraries etc.
You will take these from BSD probably.
So I am asking what are You planning to preserve in the modified system.
Will it be still be a Unix Version 7 ?

BTW I have ported apout emulator to Coherent. What I miss is "more" and
"vi". Editing with "cat" is possible but not very useful. I am not going
to learn "ed". Did You try to port "vi" to Unix Version 7 system ? I can
build everything for V7 under Coherent, so I thought about vi. One would
have to port curses . What about termcap and terminfo for V7 ?
