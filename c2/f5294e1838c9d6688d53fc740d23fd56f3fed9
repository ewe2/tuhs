I read the sources to see the TCP/IP support was there (that's the bit
about adding Berkeley Sockets). I see nowhere that it's excluded for the
non I/D machines, but haven't tried it first hand. I got interested not
because of the PDP-11, but because I have an old Rainbow that recently
started running Venix (v7-based version) and was trolling around for some
way to do TCP/IP to it (though w/o readily available ethernet cards, I'm
not sure it is a viable project).
