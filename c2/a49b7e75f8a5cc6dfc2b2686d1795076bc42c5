UUCP would transfer many batch jobs in a single session, Each job was a single command.  So you would have a mix of 'uux remote!rmail' and 'uux remote!rnews' all stacked up in the job queue to be transferred and executed on the remote host.

'uucp' and 'uux' just created remote batch jobs in a queue directory.  When 'uucico' eventually fired off, it would send the command files over, along with any associated data files.

You could 'uucp' and 'uux' anything you liked, modulo restrictions placed upon you by the administrators of the local and remote hosts.
