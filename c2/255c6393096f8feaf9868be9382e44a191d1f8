I have a thing called Demos in a hidden section of the archive, which is
a modified 7th Edition (plus other things?) from Russia. I've hidden it as
the legal status is unclear :-) I'm happy to hand it out to individual
requestors, though. However, I can't find a vi(1) in there:

/usr/Hidden_PUPS/Miscfiles/Russian: du -a | grep vi
1       ./cmd/TUVWXYZ/vipw.sh,v.gz
1       ./cmd/comint/Environment/README.gz
2       ./cmd/comint/Environment/termcap.gz
2       ./cmd/comint/Environment/tuner.gz
3       ./cmd/comint/Environment/minihelp.DEMOS.gz
9       ./cmd/comint/Environment
1       ./cmd/uucp/L-devices.gz
11      ./sys/dev/RCS/video.c,v.gz
6       ./sys/dev/RCS/vikey.c,v.gz
7       ./sys/dev/video.c.gz
1       ./sys/include/video.h.gz
3       ./sys/stand/libsa/RCS/video.c,v.gz
2       ./sys/stand/libsa/video.c.gz

and a grep on `ex' gives nothing either.
