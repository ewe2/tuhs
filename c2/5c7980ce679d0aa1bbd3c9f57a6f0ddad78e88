GNU Emacs has elisp which *is* a Lisp (albeit a fairly horrid one).

OK, then Gosling just had the idea of including lisp.

IIRC, Gosling EMACS was mainly written in C, and Mocklisp was merely an
extension language. GNU EMACS is mostly written in LISP, with the C mainly
being used to implement the LISP interpreter. That's a pretty big
architectural difference there.
