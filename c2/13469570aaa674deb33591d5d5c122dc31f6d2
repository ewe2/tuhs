AIUI there were two major revisions to the IPv4 addressing architecture:
subnetting (RFC 917, October 1994 ... RFC 950, August 1985), and classless
routing (RFC 1519, September 1993) which was originally called
supernetting (RFC 1338, June 1992). RFC 1122 consolidated all the
implementation requirements in one place, and said RFC 950 subnetting was
mandatory.
