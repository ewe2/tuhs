Anyone interested in this source code? I did a quick Google search and 
couldn't find anything relevant. If it's out there somewhere, let me 
know, I'd like to take a look at it.

It's Network File System Sun Microsystems Release 2.0

Where I got it from, that will remain nameless, used it to compile 
against BSD 4.3 on VAX, and possibly even 4.2

Is it not releasable?

I also seem to have version 3.2, but I need to verify that. For example: 
/* @(#)showmount.c      1.3 87/08/13 3.2/4.3NFSSRC */

thanks!
