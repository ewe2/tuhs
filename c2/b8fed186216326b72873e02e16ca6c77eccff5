Jose,

TNX for parking Sprite on ftp.es.embnet.org!
I just ran into a little problem.. looks as if
the node is either down, or not reachable (at
least from here (== Plano, Texas):

$ ping ftp.es.embnet.org
PING bakalao.cnb.uam.es (150.244.80.6): 56 data bytes
^C
--- bakalao.cnb.uam.es ping statistics ---
9 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
$ ftp ftp.es.embnet.org
[2 minutes later]
^C$

This goes for both my machine at home, and here at work.
Now, www.es.embnet.org responds fairly fast, so I don't
think that it's the wire across the big pond. Any
ideas?

TNX!

Regards,

Cornelius
