old licenses are still valid. Caldera/SCO are the le-
gal owners today; i.e. the license holders.
I'm not aware that they created a new license, super-
seeding the old ones.

My opinion is that the xBSDs are still restricted (to
personal, educational/research type of use).
The first really unrestricted BSD would be 4.4BSD-lite.

NetBSD was indeed the first spin-off of this one...

But as all the precedent writers, I'm no lawyer too.
