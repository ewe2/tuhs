I think so, though it wasn't high on the list of features.  Nor should
it be.  But the message system in particular (for communicating
between kernel processes) makes for a very interesting design.  Adding
networking was as simple as extending the message system beyond the
local cluster, and Tandem was running an internal world-wide network
by the early 1980s.  It makes an interesting (if not particularly
good) comparison with the Internet.
