Nice survey, thanks!

I learned C using the Norcroft C compiler on early Acorn / ARM machines
where char was unsigned. That is still the case, though ARM have switched
from Norcroft to clang.

(And I started learning about unix from reading articles about RISC iX,
Acorn's 4.3BSD port to the Archimedes.)

occasionally moderate.
