Xerox Network System (XNS) also had this property. A node had a
unique 48 bit address and each network had a unique 32 bit address.
Absolute host numbering meant you could move a host to another
network easily. IDP packet layout:


{checksum(2), length(2),
 transport ctl(1), packet type(1),
 dst net(4), dst host(6), dst socket(2),
 src net(4), src host(6), src socket(2),
 transport data(0 to 456), pad(0 to 1 byte)
}

IDP is @layer 3, same as IPv4 or IPv6.=
