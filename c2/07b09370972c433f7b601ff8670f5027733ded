Subject: [TUHS] Anybody recognise this Unix editor?
Message-ID: <20110120044440.GA27823@minnie.tuhs.org>

I thought I'd pop in another question here, given the good response we had
with #!

I first encountered Unix in 1982 at a summer school held by the University
of Wollongong in Australia. They had an modeless text editor installed,
and I have never been able to determine if this was a homegrown editor, or
an editor which was more widely distributed.

I've attached the first 2 pages of the editor's tutorial; the rest are
temporarily at http://minnie.tuhs.org/Z2/WollongongEdit/

Does anybody recognise this at all?

Many thanks in advance,
	Warren
