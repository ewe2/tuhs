We at our "Museo dell'Informatica Funzionante" Computer Museum
had our Apollo workstation online for free, with Domain/OS up
and running :) If someone want to try using this machine we can
arrange to put it back online - we're actually settling into a
new space so most of our online historical machines are actually
offline...

more to come at http://museum.freaknet.org (including an 
english version, sorry!)

p.s. we have some manuals and Domain/OS tape dumps available!
