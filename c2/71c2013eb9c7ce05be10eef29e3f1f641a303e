i386 has been demoted on FreeBSD: 
https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-announce/2021-January/002006.html

I don't think there's any change on NetBSD, no idea about OpenBSD but I 
assume they're the same.

In all honest, I don't think that backwards compatibility has ever been 
that great on Linux -at least not for the last twenty or so years, in my 
(limited) experience. It's not like Solaris where you could build on 2.4 
and there's a good chance it will run on 11 or at least 10.
