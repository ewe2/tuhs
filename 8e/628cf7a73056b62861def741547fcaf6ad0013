Amen.  As a dyslexic (which most often shows when I'm typing as you folks
have experienced) autocorrect generally is a PITA.   FWIW: Grammerly works
well for me.  It underlines in dotted red and lets me look at what it
thinks it should be - where I can accept it or not.

Doug -- I agree DWIM was just silly.... UCB's Pascal system (pix) tried it also
and let's just say it failed as I explain in a comment /answer on quora (
https://www.quora.com/When-you-are-programming-and-commit-a-minor-error-such-as-forgetting-a-semicolon-the-compiler-throws-an-error-and-makes-you-fix-it-for-yourself-Why-doesn-t-it-just-fix-it-by-itself-and-notify-you-of-the-fix-instead
).
