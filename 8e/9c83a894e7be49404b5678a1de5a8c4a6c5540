And it makes it possible to run browsers in a separate KVM into
which you log in with X11 forwarding enabled, for very insecure
things, and if your machine is strong enough.  Matthew Dillon of
DragonflyBSD posted[1] a nice recipe of separating privileges via
several different user accounts on the same machine (as in "ssh
dfw1 at localhost -n \"setenv DISPLAY :0.0; firefox\""), onto
which i added the additional KVM separation; a pain on my small
box with todays internet, however.  But possible.  And i am hoping
for improved virtual graphics, they are working on that!
