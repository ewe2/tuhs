I recently became aware that DKIM does have an option (l= length 
parameter) to specify how much of the body is covered by the DKIM signature.

I wonder if this would help in what you're describing.

It's my understanding that the motivation behind it is to allow things 
to append content to the body without breaking the DKIM signature.

Granted, it would still protect other headers.
