I'm afraid I don't get the point, apparently something about the
relative performance of stream- and non-stream tty drivers. How
do shells get into the act? And didn't uucp, which was certainly
not a slow typist, appear like any dial-up connection and thus
use /dev/ttyxx? (I cannot recollect, though, when dial-up uucp
finally ceased.)
