The problem is this talk is just self aggrandizement at large.  It
would have been cute in the year 2000.  It's pretty ridiculous
cherry-picking hoping to target an unknowing audience in 2020.

I can alt/option+space on my FreeBSD desktop, open a monitor, and kill
a process in a GUI with a top right search box the exact same as OS X.
Cool.

Modern Linux distros don't even use X11 (except nested as OS X in case
of legacy application).

The crude APIs (he calls out Linux and Windows and BSD and C) are not
secret.  I would be surprised if Linus himself didn't agree that a lot
of the Linux interfaces suck.  There's just an issue of backwards
compatibility, and you know, doing some work instead of fishing for
social points at a conference.

Android has deviated significantly from Linux.  Linux from UNIX.
Basically nobody at a Linux conference is blindly following the UNIX
philosophy.  This message makes little sense to that crowd in absolute
terms.  The kindest critique I can give is:  fighting the last war.
