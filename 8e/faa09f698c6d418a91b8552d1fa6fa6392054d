I would imagine that Windows wouldn't be what it is today without UNIX. 
Matter of fact, Windows NT (which is what Windows has been based on 
since Windows ME went away) is really DEC's VMS underneath the covers at 
least to a small extent.

Would VMS become what it was without UNIX's influence? Would UNIX become 
what it later was without VMS?

Would UNIX exist, or even be close to what it became without DEC?
