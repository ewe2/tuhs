> Subject: [9fans] Transfer of Plan 9 to the Plan 9 Foundation
>
> We are thrilled to announce that Nokia has transferred the copyright of
> Plan 9 to the Plan 9 Foundation. This transfer applies to all of the
> Plan 9 from Bell Labs code, from the earliest days through their final
> release.
>
> The most exciting immediate effect of this is that the Plan 9 Foundation
> is making the historical 1st through 4th editions of Plan 9 available
> under the terms of the MIT license. These are the releases as they
> existed at the time, with minimal changes to reflect the above.
>
> 1st and 2nd edition were never released as open source software, and
> both (but especially 1st edition) were only available to a very small
> number of people. 3rd and 4th were previously available as open source,
> but under a license which was problematic for some people (especially
> the 3rd edition). We think making these available under the MIT license
> is something that's going to be a significant benefit for all projects
> using Plan 9 code. While this doesn't automatically change the license
> on any downstream projects, and you're welcome to keep using the LPL if
> you like, you now have the option of switching to MIT, which we think
> most everyone will find preferable.
>
> Obviously, for folks in the Plan 9 community, there isn't a way to say
> "thank you" to Bell Labs, and its various parent organizations, that's
> really adequate. None of us would be talking about any of this if it
> weren't for the work done there for decades. All of us here at the Plan
> 9 Foundation express our sincerest thanks to the team at Nokia who made
> this possible, the Plan 9 alumni who supported the effort, and the Plan
> 9 community who have kept kernels booting and the userland useful.
>
> The historical releases are available right now at:
>         https://p9f.org/dl/
>
> You can read Nokia's press release on the transfer here:

> Thank you for your time,
