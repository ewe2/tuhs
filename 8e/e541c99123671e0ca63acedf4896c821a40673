I have an original (in print) of the C reference manual from Unix 6th Ed, as
part of a multipart binder titled "Documents for Use With the Unix
Timesharing System", as well as the "UNIX Programmer's Manual", which is a
print copy of the man pages.  I could probably scan the C ref in my copious
spare time, if you're not in a hurry.  Warren, do you want to archive stuff
like this?  -- Ian

I'm looking for a copy of the C reference manual from some time between
the 6th Edition (1975) and the first version that came with 4.3BSD
(1986). The stuff in the TUHS archive mostly seems to be missing the
documentation sets, or in the case of the earlier BSDs they are ommitted
for copyright reasons. There are some tutorials dating from about 1979
but they aren't much use.

Any help would be appreciated.

Tony.
