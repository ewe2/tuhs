Yes, which is why I pushed for having something like this.
The final implementation (err, errx, warn, warnx) is not
quite what I had suggested (I had an error-exit-code that,
if 0, meant this was a warning, i.e., don't exit) but the
essence is all there.

It does now.  That was not in the original.  It's a good
idea though.

I still like my "exit code" argument with zero for warn,
since it pushes one towards a nonzero exit for all errors.
