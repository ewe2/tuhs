Hello (again) from Gregg C Levine
Johnny, I already concluded that fact from the slightly peeved remarks
returned from some of the regulars on this list.  I might also add, I
only have the software here. I don't have the thing itself. If we want
to discuss this further, everyone who's interested, we can take this
off-list, or on, until we get flagged by the Owner.
