BTW: last Year there was a talk from Stephen Bourne af BSDcon where he 
explained how the Bourne Shell started. It seems that Mashey, Bourne and csh 
all started with the Thompson Shell code.

...and from a todays view, the time between 1970 anf 1976 is a short time 
compared to the fact that the Bourne Shell now exists since 40 years.
