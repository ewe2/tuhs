Of course a PDP-11 is not a MicroVAX, and vice versa.

Looking at the pictures, the only thing really worth saving would be
the chassis shown with a keyboard next to it.  One can see a floppy
disk drive, and a hole where a hard disk drive probably was once.  If
there is a nameplate on the front, it is not readable in the picture.
A picture of the rear panel would help in further identification, as
well as a reading of any nameplate data on the rear panel.
