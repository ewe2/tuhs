I did hear back from Lou Katz - user #1.  Indeed the first version that escaped the labs was the 4th edition. 

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.

The first version was even worse.  On the ucb side I wonder.  It would not have been Unix because UofI did the original arpanet code and that was for v6.  There was never a pdp10 at ucb so I wonder if it was one of the CDC machines which were the primary systems until Unix came to be.
