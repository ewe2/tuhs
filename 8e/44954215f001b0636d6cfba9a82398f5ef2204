Me too. I know even less about Spider. I've been looking for Bell Labs
Computing Science Technical Report #23. It's referenced in the visit report
below. So far, the closest I've come is
https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102773566 which says
that CHM has it on paper. :/ From about 1990 or so, these reports are easy
to find.

Oh that's very interesting. The earliest Network Unix was all about remote
login and file transfer (not file servering). The earliest version were for
telnet/ftp clients. Later versions have the servers in them.

That makes sense. The version in our archive is very close to V6.

My research matches that. Starting in about 1976 there was an explosion of
host names with -unix in their name. There's a number of ARPANET census
reports, or ARPANET resource reports that have lots of Unix systems. RFCs
show the explosion from 1977 onward. Google has these reports that can be
downloaded as a PDF, but are otherwise kinda hard to find :(.

Yea. I never understood how Unix could be so leading edge in computing, yet
so backward (at least so poor at picking winners) at networking. But this
does make a certain amount of sense. We've also seen NIH in the children of
Unix as well (Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and MacOS have all had this
issue, sometimes for good, sometimes for ill).

Yes. It's difficult to match a connected socket to a network interface...
And sockets definitely take the view that it's not a device you are talking
to at all, but a special kind of thing that you can do normal I/O to (and a
few other special things too).

We'll never know.
