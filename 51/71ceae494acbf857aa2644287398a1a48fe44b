Save design would have the plane controls on a completely air-gapped network from the
entertainment stuff.  I was told that they donâ€™t, because the captain needs to be able to
stop the entertainment system during an announcement.  I could build them a very simple gateway
that transmits UDP packets in one direction only, that would meet this, and related needs.

There have been hacks of the avionics reported from the entertainment network.  It is scary,
if true, and bush league IMO.
