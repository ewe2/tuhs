Subject: [TUHS] PDP-10 UNIX?
Message-ID: <d90d0034-b138-4b76-c28d-865d5839613e@kilonet.net>

Was there ever a UNIX or even the thought of porting one to a PDP-10?

36-bit machine, 18-bit addresses (more on KL10 and KS10), and:

*0 would return register 0 instead of a SIGSEGV ;)

8-bit bytes would have been a wasteful exercise, but you never know. 
(losing 4 bits of every 36-bit word)

thanks!
