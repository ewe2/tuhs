Greg-   Sorry if my words read and came to be interpreted to imply 1955 was t=
he date of the invention.  I only wanted clarify that Wang had the idea of m=
agnetic (core) memory before Forrester.  1955 is the date of patent grant as=
 you mentioned.  My primary point was to be careful about giving all the cre=
dit to Forrester.  It took both as I understand the history.  Again I was no=
t part of that fight =F0=9F=98=89

It seemed the courts have said what I mentioned - it was Wang=E2=80=99s orig=
inal idea and I just wanted the history stayed more clearly.   That said, ob=
viously Forrester improved on it (made it practical).  And  IBM needed licen=
ses for both btw build their products. =20

FWIW: I=E2=80=99ve been on a couple corporate patent committees. I called hi=
m on the comment because I knew that we use core history sometimes as an exa=
mple when we try to teach young inventors how develop a proper invention dis=
closure (and how I was taught about some of these issues).  What Forrester d=
id I have seen used as an example of an improvement and differentiation from=
 a previous idea.  That said, Wang had the fundamental patent and Forrester n=
eeded to rely on Wang=E2=80=99s idea to =E2=80=9Creduce to practice=E2=80=9D=
 his own.  As I said, IBM needed to license both in the end to make a produc=
t. =20

What we try to teach is how something is new (novel in patent-speak) and to m=
ake sure they disclose what there ideas are built upon.   And as importantly=
, are you truly novel and if you are - can you build on that previous idea w=
ithout a license.=20

This is actually pretty important to get right and is not just an academic e=
xercise.  For instance, a few years ago I was granted a fundamental computer=
 synchronization patent for use in building supercomputers out of smaller co=
mputers (ie clusters).  When we wrote the stuff for disclosure we had to sho=
w how what was the same, what was built upon, and what made it new/different=
.  Computer synchronization is an old idea but what we did was quite new (an=
d frankly would not have been considered in the 60s as those designers did h=
ave some of issues in scale we have today). But because we were able to show=
 both the base and how it was novel, the application went right through in b=
oth the USA and Internationally.=20

So back to my point, Forrester came up with the idea and practical scheme to=
 use Wang=E2=80=99s concept of the magnetic memory in an array, which as I u=
nderstand it, was what made Wang=E2=80=99s idea practical.  Just as my schem=
e did not invent synchronization, but tradition 1960 style schemes are impra=
ctical with today=E2=80=99s technology.=20

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.=
