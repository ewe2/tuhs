Subject: [pups] Anyone got a bulkhead connector?
Message-ID: <000501c2d207$9ca46a20$450010ac@dawabbit>

I've checked commercial vendors and eBay to no avail, so now I'll appeal to
the community: I would really like to find a bulkhead connector for a DEQNA
card (the part number is CK-DEQNA-KB).  If anyone has one they're willing to
part with, please send me email with your terms.

Otherwise, I'll just have to kludge something - but I'd sure like to do it
right, as my 11/73 is in pretty nice shape.  :-)

TIA -- Ian
