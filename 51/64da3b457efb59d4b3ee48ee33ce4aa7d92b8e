A great read.  Thanks!

I'm wondering if anyone can confirm the (possibly apocryphal) grep story 
about the meeting at Bell Labs and the person who was late because she 
couldn't find her keys?  Maybe put some names to the characters?

(I can tell the story as I heard it, but I suspect we've all heard it 
before.)

Thanks,

     Mary Ann
