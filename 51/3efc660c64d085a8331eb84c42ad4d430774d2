Subject: [TUHS] Fwd: [tz] Time, Clock, and Calendar Programming In C,
	by Eric S. Raymond
Message-ID: <1412115219.3741374.173656693.20224E67@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Eric S. Raymond has written an article about the history of the time.h
functions at http://www.catb.org/esr/time-programming/

From his blog post announcing it (http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=6311):

> The C/UNIX library support for time and calendar programming is a nasty mess of historical contingency. I have grown tired of having to re-learn its quirks every time I’ve had to deal with it, so I’m doing something about that.
> 
> Announcing Time, Clock, and Calendar Programming In C, a document which attempts to chart the historical clutter (so you can ignore it once you know why it’s there) and explain the mysteries.
> 
> What I’ve released is an 0.9 beta version. My hope is that it will rapidly attract some thoroughgoing reviews so I can release a 1.0 in a week or so. More than that, I would welcome a subject matter expert as a collaborator.

When I saw it I thought it might be generally interesting to people who
subscribe to this list.
