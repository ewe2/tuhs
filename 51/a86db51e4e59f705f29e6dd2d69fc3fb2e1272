Nroff, in bound notes at the time; it did not come out in book format 
until later (I suppose that it depends upon your definition of "book" vs. 
"bound notes"...  I was involved in it (you'll see my name in the

I helped to proof-read it, and I lent him our LA-100 for the draft copy.

He was one of the best Comp Sci lecturers that I ever had, along with Ken 
Robinson (no longer with us) and Graham McMahon (ditto).
