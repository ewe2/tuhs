The next question is, why to do this, and for which operating system(s)?

If it's to get an ANSI C compiler, or some extra performance, then I
can see the point. If it's to ditch a `contaminated' compiler, then
I can see a few difficulties, especially if the target is 2.11BSD

The 2.11BSD linker knows an awful lot about overlays, and any replacement
would need to do the same.

Anway, that's my $0.02. I thought about porting lcc to 2.11BSD ages ago,
but I've never had the time to do it.

Cheers,
