I feel like there is an option to get nvi behaviour now but I dunno
why you want that.  Are you seriously advocating for less?  Because
objectively vim gives you more.

And it is faithful to vi, it has all the buffers so you can put stuff
back that way.

Maybe I'm clueless or I drank the koolaid, but I love vim.  It's vi
but better.
