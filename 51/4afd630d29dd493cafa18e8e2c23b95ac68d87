I can't speak to CTSS, but my understanding is that the Multics shell was
a shell in the same sense as an expert-system shell: that is, a fixed
piece of code into which other code was loaded in order to customize
it to do something.  Rather than starting another process, the Multics
shell mapped the executable program the user requested into its own
space, as is done with shared libraries today, and then jumped into it.
The equivalent of exit() simply jumped back to the shell code.
