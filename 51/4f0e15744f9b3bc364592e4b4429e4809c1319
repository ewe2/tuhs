Yes.  I ported Idris (the independently-written system from Whitesmiths,
Ltd.) to the Pro 350, in an earlier life, in the early-to-mid-1980s.

Hi,

I did a port of  V6 to the 286. See:
http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Other/V6on286/

BTW, has anyone ran any Unix on the DEC Professional? (the desktop PDP11,
and Vax-console)?
