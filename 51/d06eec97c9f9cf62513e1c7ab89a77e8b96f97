Definitely a thought. An attempt was started on NetBSD for the PDP-10, 
and it sortof got halfway of getting into single-user, but I'm not sure 
if the person who worked on it just got distracted, or if he hit 
problems that were really hard to solve. I certainly know the person, 
and can find out more if people really are interested.

Yes. Not the first machine that would be true for. You don't have 
address 0 unmapped on a PDP-11 either.

Uh... Why 8 bit bytes? That way lies madness. There exists a really good 
C compiler for TOPS-20 - KCC. It uses 9 bits per byte. Works like a 
charm, except when some people write portable code that is not so 
portable. ;-)

KCC was written by KLH, unless I remember wrong. Same guy who also wrote 
the KLH-10 emulator.
