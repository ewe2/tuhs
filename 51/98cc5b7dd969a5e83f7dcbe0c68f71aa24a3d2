I don't think anything actually used SPL 7, as far as I can remember.

Right. A lost interrupt is a potential disaster and is never acceptable.
What we're talking about here is what happens after the interrupt.

I think I at least played around some with this on PDP-8 systems, and 
seem to remember it working right there. But I have not done so on PDP-11s.

This is also a pretty important point. But one which also begs the 
question how the splxxx() functions in Unix worked back then. Or did 
Unix not use this pattern and these functions back when the 11/40 was 
relevant?

My interest here is also very much on facts and technical points. I do 
not want this to become some religious argument.
