^S (stop) and ^Q (continue) at 1200 baud or less worked OK, especially 
on paper terminals ;) -- (Clem just beat me to it)

head and tail would work too (although I'm not sure they existed at that 
time, I'm no expert):

cat filename | head -20 # get the first page.
cat filename | head -40 | tail -20 # get the second page.
<ad infinitum>

etc.

I downloaded, converted, and attached 1bsd, 2bsd, and finally 3bsd and it was there that I found source for more... 3bsd looks like it's for VAX, not PDP-11, and it doesn't want to compile (looking for some externs that I gather are part of the distro's clib).

I just can't seem to locate the idiomatic way of keeping everything from constantly scrolling out of view! Obviously, this isn't a problem on my mac as terminal works fine, but I like to try to stay in character as a 1970 time traveling unix user :).
