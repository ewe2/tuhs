On Lyndon's comment - if you're trying to get a new generation of troff users
keep in mind that to younger folks than us line noise is a reason to get a
surge protector.  And if they have seen phone line noise, I still have a stack
of old modems in the basement for them.  And troff is a lot less like line
noise that OpenOffice XML.

I like the proposed improvements in the docs but would go further.

 o  As per an earlier thread, I would explain the string/number register stuff
    in programming language terms; these are variables.  And number registers
    have things like auto-increment and all that.  It may be *technically*
    correct to say that registers are interpolated, but would be way more
    accessible to talk about the value of a variable.

 o  It would be nice to have a table mapping groff constructs into those from
    other programming languages.  Common ones, that is, not perl.  Mentioned
    variables above, to me macros are functions, there are a few control
    constructs.  Explain this stuff in terms that people are familiar with,
    try to avoid crufty language.

 o  I think that it would be helpful to summarize that troff was originally
    written for smaller computers which required compromises such as the one
    and two character naming scheme.  And a table that shows how that scheme
    has been compatibly expanded since.  Better than hiding this in the
    description of every request that uses names.

 o  I think that an important point to make about diversions is that they're
    a bit like scratch paper; that one can scribble on it and take measurements
    on them to decide what to do.  For example, dumping a paragraph into a
    diversion and then measuring it to see if it will fit unbroken on what's
    left of a page.

 o  The description of traps could be expanded.  I would say something like the
    original traps were a vertical location on a page, and that since then the
    term has been overloaded with number of additional varieties.
