Actually, a modified version of the * approach will also work.  When
switching processes, swap the whole process out to your fastest device (on
* this was a single write to the drum) and swap in the new process.  *
hardware had a bounds register, so it was only necessary to swap out enough
of the previous process to fit the smaller process in.  So after a while,
core started to look like an onion, with the current process at the bottom
and pieces of larger non-current processes above that.

(I thought that * was MIT CTSS, but I can't confirm that.)

As for interrupts, the stock 2e has both IRQ and NMI lines. Erann Gat aka
Ron Garret explains in <

how to make an external clock and hook it to the NMI pin for 25 cents in
1981 dollars (about $1.67 today; h/t measuringworth.com).
