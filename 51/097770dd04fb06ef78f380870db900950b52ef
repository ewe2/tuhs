The funny thing, if I did read correctly the filings and agreements from
Groklaw is that a legal third party could probably release this code 
*legally* if it is *acually* available.

I'm talking about something that popped up in the SCO vs IBM case: as I
remember, the agreement stated that IBM was required to held confidential 
all information except in the case it had been made widely available by
some third party.

Thus it seems possible that UNIX source code licensees would -in the case the
code had been made available *by others* have no longer obligation to keep it
confidential.

But, and this is IMPORTANT, IANAL, so don't take my word for it. My guess is 
that even if so, most licensses will be reluctant to take any action without 
legal counsel, which is costly and unless they had a compelling reason to, 
they would therefore rather not ask, not act and not risk.
