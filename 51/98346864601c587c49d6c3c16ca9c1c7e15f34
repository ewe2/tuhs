As a former developer and manager, I would be really pissed off if my 
programmers wasted their time on writing useless frippery instead of 
quality code, and I would certainly have a little chat with them...

Or is that just me?

And is some M$ malware still masquerading as easter eggs?  Simple enough 
to do: write it, wait for it to spread a bit, announce you've found a new 
egg (but it may not work for everyone (and will now))...
