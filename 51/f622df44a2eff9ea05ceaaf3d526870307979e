What was delivered as binary was the Advanced Floating-Point Accelerator
microcode.

At the end of the AOS work circa 1996, most of the kernel was 4.4,
except for the network stack which was 4.3-Reno, and the VM system which
was still 4.3 (hence no mmap).

The compiler was Metaware High C. GCC could not be used to compile the
kernel sources unchanged, because one of the locore->trap.c paths was
relying upon the stack layout used by the compiler. With that fixed, gcc
could be used to build a working kernel.
