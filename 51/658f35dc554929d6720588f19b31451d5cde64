One possibility might be to propose a "50th Unix Anniversary" Developer 
Room at FOSDEM 2019 [1].  FOSDEM is a free event for software developers 
to meet, share ideas and collaborate.  It takes place every year with 
thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over 
the world gathering in Brussels.

Our room can be used to host presentations related to topics such as the 
Unix history, the 50th anniversary, and the reconstruction efforts of 
historic editions.  The many *BSD and Linux folks that attend FOSDEM 
together with thousands of other open source aficionados provide an 
excellent audience for our event.  We can also combine the presentations 
with a TUHS stand where we can display running historic software.

The deadline for room proposals is September 20th and for stands 
November 2nd [2].  FOSDEM is entirely organized by volunteers and 
attendance is free without registration.  We don't have to pay anything 
for the room and the stand, but we also can't expect any funding from 
the organizers for flying people in.
