Hhhmmm.... I must dig my copy out of storage because I do not remember
emacs in there.

As for emac uses, my wife was on (non-CS) staff at a local college
affiliated with U of T.  At the time, DOS boxes sat on staff desks and
email was via a telnet connection to an SGI box somewhere on campus.
A BATch file connected and ran pine but shelled out to an external
editor.  What was the editor?  Well, I saw her composing a message
once and ending the editor session by ^X^C.
