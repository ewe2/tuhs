I think whether you think Emacs is large or small depends on what you think it is.  If you think it's a text editor it's huge (by the standards of the 1970s, anyway: I have things which purport to be text editors which have python interpreters in and are significantly larger than Emacs, *on my phone*).   But if you think of it as the userland of an operating system it's rather small.  And many Emacs users do (or did: I used to but don't so much any more) treat it as the latter.
