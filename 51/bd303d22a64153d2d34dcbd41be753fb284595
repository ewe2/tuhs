As far as I know, they're still held tightly by whatever part of AT&T 
inherited them.

They should be released - for a variety of reasons, amongst them the pulling 
of the teeth of various entities intent on muddying the waters with an 
outflux of legal venom.

Perhaps someone should set up a petition to that inheriting entity, a la the 
Ancient Unix petition, asking them on behalf of all interested parties, that 
they release them under a suitable license - perhaps BSD, it's nice and short 
and easy to remember - some people out there have very short attention spans 
and we don't want them confused.

Any comments?
