My first question was going to be 'Maybe try an earlier version of the
source?', but I see there is no earlier version online. Odd. ISTR that some
of the fun things in V6 came without source, maybe blackjack was the same way?

Where's the binary? I'd like to take a look at it, and see if the source was
assembler, or C (there's a C version in the source tree, too). Then I can
look and see how close it is to that 2.11 source - that may be a
re-implementation, and totally different.
