A bit more recovered from the dennis_v6 tape:
speak.v (I believe in its entirety, so the speak program is probably 
usable now! The file Doug sent me helped quite a bit here, as the order 
isn't only alphabetical which was throwing me off)
vs.c (this exists in the v5 archive 
(http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V5/usr/sys/dmr/vs.c) but 
the version here has ~2 lines different; the 'vsmap' character array 
only exists in the v5 one, here it is embedded in the code as a string, 
hence may be slightly older?)

Note both of these files violated the 'all sectors appear in reverse 
order' "rule" and each had one sector which appeared 'out of pattern'.
