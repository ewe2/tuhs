Message-ID: <20020523082415.916E040EAD4@enigma.cybertime.ch>

is there anybody who has successfully installed 4.3-quasijarus on
simh, who could tell me how to install the bootblocks (I am not
completely sure that I got the disklabel right). The exact incantation
of installboot and the output of disklabel would be very helpful.
