I have run into interesting Unix code on the bitsavers site under
bits/Unisoft and bits/SGI.  In addition, archive.org has some
interesting snapshots as well.  I have always assumed they may be
tainted in some way that discourages further exposure?  Do these sites
have some kind of "library" status that provides cover to host these
artifacts?
