For all that it's the butt of jokes, ed is awesome. I didn't really 
appreciate it until vi wasn't an easy goto option anymore (v6). After 
reading Kernighan's tutorial, I kind of fell in love with it. g/re/p? 
Who'd of thunk it? ed may not be 'visual', but the entire document is 
editable and its support of regex and the global command are incredibly 
powerful. Especially, for so incredibly tiny an editor. Finally, ed is 
the sibling of sed and once I got the connection there, it opened up a 
whole new world of editing awesomeness.
