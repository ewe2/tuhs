 why is it mt1 instead of mt0

Interesting! Chuck Haley is also listed as the author of tar in "Life
with Unix" p. 31 (Libes and Resler, Prentice Hall,  1989).  I wonder
where that piece of misinformation came from and what other errors are
in the book.

Anyway, I corrected tar's authorship in the Unix history Git repo
