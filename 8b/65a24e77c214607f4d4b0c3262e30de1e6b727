Charles Babbage KH FRS was born on this day in 1791; pretty much the 
father of the computer, a model of his "difference engine" built to the 
standards of the day worked, complete with its printer.  What is not so 
well known about him was that he dabbled in cryptography, and broke the 
Vigen√®re cipher; unfortunately for him it was classified as a military 
secret, so one Friedrich Kasiski got the credit instead.
