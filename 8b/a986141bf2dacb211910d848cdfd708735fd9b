I was program committee chair for Linux Expo in 1999 (all that means is
I formatted the proceedings into a book).  I let people use LaTex but
encouraged troff.  A few people tried out troff and their reaction was
"Wow, that was so easy and groff is really fast!"

The only negative reaction was table of contents complaints, LaTex is
2 pass so it can do them, roff is one pass so you have to fiddle with
things.  A lot.

I've used *roff for almost 40 years and I've never had the urge to use
something else.  I wrote a paper a while back where they insisted on
LaTex and it just made me like *roff more.

It's Betamax and VHS all over again, the crappy answer won.
