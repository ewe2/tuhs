In case the first reply didn't get there, I am having difficulties everywhere at the moemnt :-((((

It is more complicated than just the /r.  I've checked the scripts and they are quite legal.  I can run them from my home directory but not from the directory I am using to build the packages in.  This is the same for the distributed scripts and any that I write.  The package directory is on a separate device fom the home directories and all of the directories above the packages one are set 777.

I'm now positively confused!!!!!
