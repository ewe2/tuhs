I carried an RK05 disk full of proprietary software from West Orange NJ
to a client in Kansas City back in 1977.  Airport security existed, but
it wasn't as anal it is today.  So when I told them they couldn't X-ray
the disk, it might scramble it, they wanted to do a physical inspection --
but I told them if they opened the disk they'd get dust in it and ruin it.
Finally they took my word for it.

When the disk got to the client's, it was completely scrambled anyway.
I went back home, and next week my partner went out with a stack of 5.25s.
It took him twenty hours to set up the client's system (I don't remember
if it was a PDP-8 or a PDP-11), but the job got done.

For living or dark undead, I will smite you if you touch him.
