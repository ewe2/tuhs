Well, I thought using google should be simple:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Development_and_Distribution_License

Check the video mentioned there as this just lists what Simon did say.

BTW: Danese Cooper was (from what I know) not involved in the CDDL at all.

I had a 2 hour telephone conference with Andrew Tucker, a Sun lawyer and 
a lady from Sun (I do no longer remember her name but it was definitely not 
Danese). The reason for the telephone confernce was to discuss the changes for
the final CDDL license text.
