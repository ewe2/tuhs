I believe Dave Kapilow kept up development of pi at Bell,
long after Tom Cargill had left research. There is a CDROM
of pi as of about 2002, with versions compilable for various
architectures, but the terminal part, which was actually 'pads',
originally Blit graphics, was replaced with Openlook. It isn't
hard to get pads working with the Plan graphics model.

The problem with that distribution is that it is still all
stabs-based, and although dwarf is a nightmare, being able to
read dwarf symbol tables in pi would be a pleasing step forward.
Dealing with dwarf is a struggle, but Russ Cox and Rob Pike have
written perhaps the only sane code in the world to deal with the
complexities in a nice way. One is advised to avoid 'libdwarf'.

e stuff about the road from 7th Edition to 8th Edition, this time about deb=
uggers.<br>
<br>
My current understanding is as follows:<br>
<br>
- On 6th edition the debugger was =E2=80=98cdb=E2=80=99<br>
<br>
- On 7th edition it was =E2=80=98adb=E2=80=99, a rewrite / evolution from =
=E2=80=98cdb=E2=80=99<br>
<br>
- In 32V a new debugger appears, =E2=80=98sdb=E2=80=99. Its code seems a de=
rivative from =E2=80=98adb=E2=80=99, but the command language is substantia=
lly reworked and it uses a modified variant of the a.out linker format - in=
 essence the beginnings of =E2=80=98stabs=E2=80=99. Of course the compiler,=
 assembler, linker and related tools all emit/recognize these new symbol ta=
ble elements. <br>
<br>
- The July 78 file note by London/Reiser does not mention a reworked debugg=
er at all; the 32V tape that is on TUHS has =E2=80=99sdb&#39; files that ar=
e dated Feb/Mar 1979. This stuff must have been developed between July 78 a=
nd March 79.<br>
<br>
- In the SysIII and 3BSD code on TUHS (from early 80 and late 79 respective=
ly) the stabs format is more developed. For SysIII it is =E2=80=98VAX only=
=E2=80=99. With these roots, it is not surprising that it is also in 8th Ed=
ition.<br>
<br>
<br>
Two questions:<br>
<br>
(1) According to Wikipedia the original author of the stabs format is unkno=
wn. It also says that the original author of =E2=80=98sdb=E2=80=99 is unkno=
wn. Is that correct, is the author really unknown?<br>
<br>
(2) As far as I can tell, the =E2=80=99sdb=E2=80=99 debugger was never back=
 ported to 16 bit Unix, not in the SysIII line and not in the 2.xBSD line. =
It would seem to me that the simple stabs format of 32V would have lent its=
elf to being back ported. Is it correct that no PDP11 Unix used (a simple) =
stabs tool chain and debugger?<br>
