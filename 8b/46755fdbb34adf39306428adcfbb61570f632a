Assuming that you are in the US you might want to put some kind of
blanket disclaimer on your web site - something like the one at:

http://gatekeeper.dec.com/hypertext/info/export-controls.html

which essentially says that it is the responsibility of people
downloading stuff from your site to ensure that they comply with
any and all export regulations.

I am not a lawyer and have no idea whether this kind of statement
actually gives you any real protection but obviously someone at
DEC once thought that it did ...
