As I mentioned in a previous message on this thread, when I took that root
pack image from the Shoppa group, I could get it to boot to Unix right off.
All it needs is a single RL02 drive (RL/0) (and the console terminal, of
course).

I looked at the 'unix' on it, and it's for an 11/40 type machine (which
includes 11/23's); IIRC the README page for that set of disk images indicates
that in fact they originally came off an 11/23, so they should run fine on
yours.

That Unix has a couple of other devices built into it (looks like an RX and
some sort of A-D), but as long as you don't try and touch them, they will not
be an issue.

Let me know if you need any help getting it up (once you have a working RL02).
