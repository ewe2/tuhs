Things might have been different if Plan9 was open sourced in the same time
frame as 386BSD and early Linux. Back then Linux was not good enough. plan9
was not all that different from unix and simpler to understand and use.

As Marshall Conover (& later I) said, containers & docker filled a genuine
need. Not much to do with the complexity of Linux. Plan9 could've provided
a much simpler and cleaner platform than linux but that was not to be.
[plan has a couple of global names spaces that might have needed changing.
Specifically the process id and '#' driver spaces]
