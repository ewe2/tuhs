Yes, it's a fairly straightforward to write an operator precedence parser
using a pushdown automaton. Knuth wrote about it in 1962 :-) [page 8]
https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_computersA_13990695

I crufted together a #if evaluator for unifdef nearly 20 years ago, but
it's, um, rather messy. (I was hacking on Dave Yost's code from the 1980s)
http://dotat.at/cgi/git/unifdef.git/blob/HEAD:/unifdef.c#l950

More recently I learned how to write a Pratt parser (1973), which is just
a particular style of operator precedence parser, but when it's done
properly it can be really neat.

https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/512927.512931

The driver loop is tiny, if you set up the table mapping tokens to actions
in the right way, so that the state transition functions handle errors as
well as happy-path evaluation. (Blame Pratt for the field names!)

	static Value
	eval(Parser *p, int rbp) {
		Value v = token[p->tok].nud(p);
		while(token[p->tok].lbp > rbp)
			v = token[p->tok].led(p, v);
		return(v);
	}

Vaughan Pratt also designed the pretty neat Sun logo.

Tony.

Channel Islands: Variable or northeasterly 1 to 3, becoming west to
southwest 2 to 4 late evening, backing south to southeast soon after dawn,
veering southwest to west 3 to 5 by noon, locally variable 1 to 3 in the
far south of the area. Smooth or slight, with a low swell developing
later. Mist and fog patches clearing early by early afternoon showers at
first and again later rain and drizzle for a time, overnight and in the
morning. Moderate to good, occasionally poor locally very poor.
