Subject: [TUHS] SCO & Caldera?
Message-ID: <200303110843.h2B8hKtx002312@localhost.localdomain>

Can someone clarify for me how Caldera fits in the picture?  I thought
SCO sold Unix to Caldera?  It was Caldera that did the BSD-ing of ancient
Unix.

FWIW I too paid $100 for an ancient Unix license, and I've got the System III
stuff that licensees had access to.

Thanks,

Arnold
