Well, FWIW, I asked them last year in relation to OSF/1 and the requirement 
for an AT&T license, and I got a reply from Bill Dunford.  I think the best 
thing to do would be to approach (semi-officially) the relevant companies and 
ask (politely ;).

This is my email and the reply:
Hi Wesley,

I have no immediate answer to this, but I've directed your question to
people who will be able to respond. If for some reason you don't find
out what you're looking for, please let me know.

Hi.

I understand that Novell's background actions helped The Unix Heritage
Society
preserve and distribute the Ancient Unix and *BSD code, by permitting
the Santa
Cruz Operation to waive the System V license requirement in the
earlier
pre- 4.4BSD- Lite BSD distributions.

I'm interested in getting hold of the OSF/1 June 1994 source code
release for
The Unix Heritage Society, being a member of that amorphous body.  I
have been
informed by the Open Group that it requires the OSF/1 licensee to have
a System
V license.

Would it be possible for Novell at some stage, maybe when this farce
with The
SCO Group has run its course, to direct the Open Group to waive the
System V
license requirement for OSF/1?

Thanks

Wesley Parish
