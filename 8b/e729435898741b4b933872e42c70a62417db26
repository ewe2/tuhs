Bill,

Your posting brought back fond memories of running Ratfor and tools on
an Interdata 8/32 during my University CO-OP work terms.

I took a look around and found a copy of the Software Tools Package on a
page called "Ken Yap's Links" at:

	http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/9247/

in the section entitled "Some source for compilers of historical
interest".

Hope this helps.

Regards,
