Yes, C allows arrays of arrays, and I've used them aplenty.
However an "n-dimensional array" has one favored dimension,
out of which you can slice an array of lower dimension. For
example, you can pass a row of a 2D array to a function of a
1D variable, but you can't pass a column. That asymmetry
underlies my assertion. In Python, by contrast, n-dimensional
arrays can be sliced on any dimension.
