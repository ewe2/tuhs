Hi,

The hardware runs on 8-bit clean channels.  Most UNIX kernels
kinda prefer to use 7e1 or 7o1.

Once you're logged in to the system, type "stty -parenb bits8" or
"stty -parenb cs8" or "stty -parenb 8" to go back to 8-bit mode.
Then reset your terminal program again :)

> Also, if I can't fix this, will vtserver/vtc run on 7-E-1 comms?
Nope.  VTc requires an 8-bit clean channel (for now).
