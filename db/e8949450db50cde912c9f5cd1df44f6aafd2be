A number of responses, all of which boil down to the same thing, viz: an 
interrupt on each character.

I know that, which is why we (UNSW) re-worked the driver; I can't believe 
that we were the only ones who did so.  It cleaned out as many silos as it 
could, possibly even by disabling interrupts completely and using clock 
ticks; I can't remember.

With any luck, the driver (dz.c?) should be on Minnie somewhere; it was 
done by Ian Johnston(sp?) at the Australian Graduate School of Management
(ianj at agsm, or possibly ianj at agsm70).
