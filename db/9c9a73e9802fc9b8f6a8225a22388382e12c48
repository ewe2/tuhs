Probably the closest thing you'll ever get to an "authoritative" map would 
be to hack pathalias to generate output that can be fed to dot.  If you 
include the pathalias link weights in the output, I'm guessing Graphviz 
could do a reasonable job of generating a traffic-weighted map (i.e. 
something that clearly pointed out the major relay hubs).
