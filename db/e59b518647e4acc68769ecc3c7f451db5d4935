Agree. I'd like to get my hands on a /94 myself... :-)

Less powerhungry, yes. It also takes less space on the Unibus, and is
faster. But I wasn't aware that the DEUNA had any more bugs than the
DELUA. Please enlight me. (I only use DELUAs myself, but I have one or two
DEUNAs lying around).

TUK50 was (is) the name of that controller. I've actually played with a
VAX-11/750 with a TK50 once upon a time many moons ago.

	That sounds a little small.  AH, let me go check /etc/disktab on 
	the PDP-11

	The RA90 was ~1.2GB:

		:pc#2376153:oc#0:bc#1024:fc#1024:

	and the RA92 was closer to 1.4GB:

	Was there a TUK70 - or was the TK70 for the Qbus systems only?

	An 11/93 would be nice too, Qbus systems use less power and make less
	noise from what I have seen.

	I know the DEQNA had firmware problems that could cause the board to
	lock up under load - perhaps I was confusing the DEQNA and DEUNA.
	The later Qbus board (DELQA) was much nicer in the same way that the
	DELUA is better than the DEUNA.

Well, I'm in love with Unibus systems... I have an 11/84 at home, and of
course, there is always Magica, which is an 11/70... :-)
(And then we have Knase, which is our 11/70 with 2.11BSD. Unfortunately,
both systems are powered off right now because of cooling problems. :-(

I don't think the DEUNA has that bug which riddles the DEQNA.
Also, the DEUNA/DELUA loads some microcode when I start using them, this
is running RSX. That microcode is located on the RSX system. Beats me what
it is for, or anything.
Worse (parhaps) is that the device driver for the DEUNA/DELUA don't work
with any Q-bus models, which means I don't have a driver for Q-bus
machines...

Anybody know anything more about this? I really don't care to dig around
the sources here, and also, I don't have the sources to all components.

Yes, Q-bus only. When the TK70 came out, I guess DEC had decided to stop
development of Unibus peripherials.
I very much doubt they sold that many TUK50, or RUX50 controllers.
