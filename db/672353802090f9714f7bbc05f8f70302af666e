I recently came across this:

	http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/202

It's been there for a while but I hadn't noticed it. It describes the
trials and tribulations of getting the Mergenthaler 202 up and running
at Bell Labs and is very interesting reading.

I have already requested that they archive their work with TUHS and
gotten a positve response about this from David Brailsford. In the
meantime, it's fun reading!

Enjoy,

Arnold
