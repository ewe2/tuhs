Datakit seemed like a prettier picture. I suppose you can DOS-attack the =

worse, it was designed by phone engineers rather than.... however you'd =

come a long way, but the engineering of the original Radio Shack parts =
was not favored by the Bell Labs crowd.

I was not putting Datakit down, just trying to explain why the V8 =
approach to networking may seem a little odd from a 1980=E2=80=99s =
TCP/IP perspective, but makes perfect sense from a Datakit perspective.

In the end technology often becomes a hybrid of various solutions, and =
maybe in this case as well. By coincidence there was a post in the =
Internet History mailing list earlier today that appears to make this =
point.

In his video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DojRtJ1U6Qzw), Sandy =
explains why he became dissatisfied with Spider and the main reason was =
that doing switching/routing on a mini computer was just plain =
inefficient as compared to a telephone switch (at 37:06). This was 1972. =
The result was a new design, Datakit, that could route/switch packets at =
high speed and in parallel.

On the internet history list, someone quipped: "Yeah, back then the joke =
was that McQuillan was the only one making money from ATM. :-) That did =
change in a big way (for a while) in the late 90s and early 2000s, =
before router silicon caught up."

To this Craig Partridge responded: "Wasn't just router silicon -- it was =
router design.  What made ATM appealing is that it made the inside of =
the router or switch parallel, which was necessary to push into =
multigigabit rates. Folks had to figure out how to rework an Internet =
router to be parallel and it took at least two major innovations: =
fully-standalone forwarding tables with associating forwarding engines =
and breaking packets apart (essentially into cells), squirting those =
parts through the parallel backplane, and then reassembling the packet =
at the outbound interface for transmission." This was around 2000.

It is not my field of expertise, but it would seem to me that Sandy had =

come up with a similar solution. I would not even be surprised if I =
learned that modern telco routers transparantly set up virtual circuits =
for tcp traffic.
