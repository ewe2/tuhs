I have an Apple Keyboard II, an M0487. The layout is kinda braindead, 
though good enough for its purpose, given that I only have the Mac it's 
connected to because I need a host for the //e card.

I prefer the actual //e layout. That's pretty close to the M layout, but 
~` is on the bottom about where Left Windows is on modern keyboards, and 
ESC, Ctrl and Caps Lock are where you guys would probably expect them. ;)

But I don't really mind Ctrl in the corners.

-uso.
