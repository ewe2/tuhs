My memories of dmr are limited to one encounter when he came to Italy, more p=
recisely to the University of Milan, in the late 70s or early 80s (cannot re=
member exactly, there=E2=80=99s a picture in Peter Salus=E2=80=99 book thoug=
h).

I was a child, had been introduced to Lisp as part of an experiment in teach=
ing to primary school children but my dad, at the time teaching robotics in t=
he nascent =E2=80=9CCybernetics=E2=80=9D group of the Physics department, wa=
s starting me on C.=20

As I was told this visitor was the R in the =E2=80=9CK&R=E2=80=9D book I fel=
t I could finally ask =E2=80=9Csomeone who knew=E2=80=9D how printf() worked=
 with a variable number of arguments. I was at best 10 and dmr patiently sat=
 down and explained it to me in terms I could understand. I remember that he=
 asked me if I understood pointers, I told him it was like putting a big arr=
ow which you could move around, pointing to a house instead of actually usin=
g the house number and he smiled then taking the explanation on from there.

I wish I could have met him again in my life to thank him for that time he d=
edicated to a child to demystify printf().
