Oh yes, there was Unix Review, and several others.  Unix Review was 
special in that
the editor chose to set up an Editorial Board by inviting key people in 
the Unix
field, e.g. John Mashey, Steve Bourne, etc., to direct and comment upon 
editorial content (in
a volunteer, as opposed to paid, fashion). The group met once a month at 
Chantilly,
a posh restaurant in Palo Alto.
