...and then there's an exceptionally complicated CPU execution
pipeline in which code is rearranged to try to allow the CPU to
execute it as fast as possible while preserving "observable" behavior.

As we know, down that road lies... security vulnerabilities.

That said, I agree; I don't know how many times I've nearly headdesked
coming across code that looks like someone typed the first thing that
entered their mind, instead of actually thinking the problem through
first and _then_ coding a solution. I'm almost certainly not innocent
there myself, either, although I do try.
