Thanks for reminding me about your work. I had scanned it briefly when I 
was first starting down this road, but wrote it off because I wasn't 
using the Ersatz11 simulator. With the background I have now, it should 
be translate into my current frame and be useful. I haven't tried 
tackling the time problem yet, but I will keep your document in mind 
along with Wolfgang's fixes for ctime:

Oops. I will be more careful in how I refer to the PDP-11 from now on.

Thanks for this. I will update my note appropriately.

This is a duh moment for me. I will change the note to reflect testing 
first, then copy over.

I have since learned a lot more about this and will update the note.
