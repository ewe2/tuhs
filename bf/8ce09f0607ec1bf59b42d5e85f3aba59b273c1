Many thanks - I will compare this with
https://github.com/eunuchs/unix-archive/tree/master/PDP-11/Trees/V7/usr/src=
/cmd/c
which is what I have been looking at.

I guess that by this time the work had transitioned to pcc so probably
there isn't a later version available?

Thank you for the info - I will certainly look at the USENIX tapes.

I will try to port the C compiler to amd64 - while preserving as much of
the original code as I can. But not sure if this is even feasible.

Thanks and Regards
