in lieu of X scrollbars, there's also terminal multiplexers like tmux or
screen.  Also, there's the case of working directly on a character cell
terminal or console (rare these days, I admit, but I still do it frequently
enough to occasionally get caught without a scrollback buffer and lose
important stuff).  Hence my use of tmux et al..

So, yeah, agree.
