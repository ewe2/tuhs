I think the position of the stress is important.  `Unix', the way I
pronounce it (and I think the way everyone does) is stressed on the 1st
syllable, as is `eunuch' and `Multics'.  To a large extent the distinction
in the sound of the 2nd syllable then doesn't matter because in typical
English dialects they all end up the same null sound (schwar? I forget the
name).

`unique' for instance has stress on second syllable, so really is very
different.
