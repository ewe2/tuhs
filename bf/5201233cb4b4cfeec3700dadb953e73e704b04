Yes, it's freely available now, as of about 2002.  You can download it
=66rom http://www.lemis.com/grog/Documentation/Lions/ .  My question
related to a discussion about its copyright status when it was
written, and how it was published.  Warren's photos conveniently show
the title page (with dedication by Lions himself) with the text

  This document may contain information covered by one or more
  licenses, copyright and non-disclosure agreements.  Circulation of
  this document is restricted to holders of a license for the UNIX
  Software System from Western Electric.  All other circulation or
  reproduction is prohibited.

Since the release of the Ancient Unix license in 2002, this no longer
applies, of course.
