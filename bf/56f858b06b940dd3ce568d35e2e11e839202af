The first 8086 port was inside of Bell Labs, but was for a system with a
custom MMU. The first commercial one was Venix released in 1983 based on
Version 7 with some Berkeley improvements using the MIT compilers of the
time, but it had a blue label with a boring stylized V on it. IBM released
PC/IX a year later (1984) and marketed heavily. It was a companion to its
other unix offerings, and wasn't AIX. That port was based on System III. If
anything had the clever Charlie Chaplin marketing materials, it was sure to
be PC/IX. Microsoft's Xenix was also in this time frame, but wasn't
marketed by IBM (and its earliest version in 1982 predate Venix, but were
only for Intel's System 86 machines, and may have required an Intel MMU
board (the quick research I did was unclear on this point, other than it
was supported). SCO/Microsoft released in late 1983 and early 1984 versions
for the commercially available PC and other variants at the time before the
IBM-PC became the standardized x86 platform.

So my money is on PC/IX.
