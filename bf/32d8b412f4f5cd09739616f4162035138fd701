Proper program exit integer status codes.
Now that "set -o pipefail" is a standardized feature of POSIX
shells all that is needed are programs which properly handle
errors and also report that to the outside.  This is very hard,
especially when put over existing codebases.

But also new code.  For example i use BTRFS (with a long term
perspective to switch to ZFS, because of restartable snapshot
sends, and also because of ZFS encrypted partitions to replace my
several encfs-encrypted on-demand storages, these now can even be
shared in between FreeBSD and Linux), (i use it at all because it
ships with the Linux kernel, can be compiled-in, is
copyright-compatible, that is i wanted to test that coming from
over two decades of ext2/3/4 on Linux and of course the default of
FreeBSD, and i really drive the entire thing with subvolumes, only
the EFI boot partition is truly separate), anyhow, receiving
snapshots can fail but the snapshot counts as having been properly
received, and no exit status whatsoever will report the failure.
(At least in my practical experiences.)
Easy scriptability with proper (also meaning automatically
interpretable) error reports.
