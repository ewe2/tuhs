It's always interesting how parallel development happens with certain 
things.

I certainly had no exposure to EMACS at the time I came up with the 
idea, nor the rest of this community you describe.

I'm not sure I like vim's coloring, actually. I find myself having to 
search for a nonexistent string just to get rid of it's highlighting of 
a search string.
