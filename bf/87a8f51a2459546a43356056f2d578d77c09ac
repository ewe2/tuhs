I had a look at OSNews.com and found a story about a nifty little  
terminal and its OS called Blit.

Blit_a_multitasking_windowed_UNIX_GUI_from_1982

I suspect getting hold of it would be like getting blood from a  
stone, much like getting the Research Unix source trees ... but still  
it would be interesting to look at if at all possible.
