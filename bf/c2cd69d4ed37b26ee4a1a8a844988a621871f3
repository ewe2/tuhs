That's how goto worked, yes.

I think the SysV/Research split is just another variant of NIH and separate
organizations. The development folks did what they did because it helped
them (or perhaps just to have fun?). Features in CB Unix bothered us (like
the way init worked) and although we were pressured to take them, we
resisted. USG was more accommodating. They (USG, Unix Support Group) were
just that: a support group, and they were under immense pressure from their
users in the Bell System to add features. There was outright mockery from
us at how complex stty became, and then the ultimate insult arrived, ioctl.
So System V was theirs, managed by them, owned by them. Occasionally we'd
go to meetings there to try to convince them to do something differently. I
remember a meeting where I tried to talk them out of some truly awful
shared memory or IPC thing, but the details are hazy. I'm sure they ignored
me anyway; in general they didn't listen to us unless their users were
asking for something we had.

Mashey's shell was better than the v6 shell, no question, but it was still
pretty clunky and undisciplined. If I remember right, it was a hacked up v6
shell, but I'm not sure.

Steve Bourne, who understands formal languages and was (clearly!) a fan of
Algol 68, decided a more structured approach was necessary. People malign
the look of the code, but his research shell was lovely. For v8 I ripped
the IF ELIF macros out; they were just sugar I could scrape off. I put in
shell functions, which Steve had wanted to do anyway, made them exportable
(fought for that hard at a POSIX meeting, with Ken) and did some cleanups
to the printing etc. so it worked well when you cut and paste from the
terminal. All that was easy to do because the code was so clean. I learned
a lot working on that program. The parser is a jewel. I still think it's a
great piece of code, and I miss the v8 shell every day. The GNU "Bourne
again" shell is missing all that stuff I did.

Unfortunately, Steve's memory allocation trick, mallocking on faults, isn't
portable, and I suspect the code will never run on a modern OS. Tom Duff's
rc was done as a reaction to the shell being, despite its other glories,
still a macro language. But that's another story.
