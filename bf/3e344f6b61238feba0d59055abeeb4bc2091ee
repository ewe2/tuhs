The most annoying terminal I ever used was a HeathKit thing that not only wouldn’t display lowercase letters, it didn’t just display the upper case version of the character.
If you sent it a lower case letter, it printed gibberish.   It was a good thing that the UNIX TTY driver LCASE mode output uppercase.

The thing also had a keyboard of identical keys and the assembler was given stickers for each letter to stick to each one.
