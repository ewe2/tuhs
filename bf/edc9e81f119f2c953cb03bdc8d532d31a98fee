You're kind of reminding me of the HEP (heterogeneous element
processor) talk that I saw at I think Usenix in Santa Monica.
My opinion is that it was a "kitchen sink" project - let's
throw in a few of these and a few of those and so on.  Also
analogous to what I saw in the housing market up here when
people started cashing in their California huts for Oregon
mansions - when we lived in California we could afford two
columns out front but now we can afford 6 columns, 8 poticos,
6 dormers, 4 turrets, and so on.  Just because you can built
it doesn't keep it from being an ugly mess.

So my question on many of these processors is, has anybody
given any thought to system architecture?  Most likely all
of us have had to suffer with some piece of spiffy hardware
that was pretty much unprogrammable.  Do the performance
numbers mean anything if they can't be achieved in an actual
system configuration?
