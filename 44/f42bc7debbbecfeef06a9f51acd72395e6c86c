I was at UCSD on the Pascal project, so I was used to using a machine =
with
a nice editor and had access to the OS source code to play with and =
learn from.
When UCSD spun the Pascal project out to SofTech MicroSystems I moved as
well. SofTech had a pdp 11/45 running V6 with the famous patch tape.

We called it V6.9.

When I first logged in, it was just a feeling of simplicity and =
elegance. I could
edit files, move them around on the disk, and when I was curious about =
what
was happening under the covers, I could go look at the sources.

Aha - I could use the shell to script the formatting of text files =
making the task
of generating new printed documentation for the Pascal Project something
as easy as saying ./printdocs.sh. After that it was all nroff, vi, and C =
compiler
experiences, learning what really made this system tick.

Back at UCSD I got access to the VAX (sdcsvax) and did all of my =
homework
there never again returning to the Pascal system on the Terak boxes.

Never looked back, I=E2=80=99ve been using Unix as my OS ever since.
