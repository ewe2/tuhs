In 2007 I started entering the contents of Eric Levenez=E2=80=99s =
=E2=80=9CUnix History=E2=80=9D diagram into =E2=80=9Cdot=E2=80=9D format =
to use with Graphviz.
It stalled when I was unable to create a diagram I really liked.

My recollection is that I talked with Warren about encoding this data =
and creating diagrams.
He compiled the TUHS =E2=80=9CUnix Tree=E2=80=9D, presumably now the =
definitive resource, but I haven=E2=80=99t see a diagram linked from =
there.

There=E2=80=99s the github =E2=80=9CUnix History=E2=80=9D project by =
TUHS list folk	<https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo>
I didn=E2=80=99t research producing timelines & relationships =
automatically from git:
	this would be a solid solution, if the Repo was considered as =
permanent as the TUHS site.

The =E2=80=9CLinux Distribution Timeline=E2=80=9D is based on a tool, =
gnuclad, that takes CSV files and 'computes a cladogram=E2=80=99 in SVG. =
conversion to PNG is via ImageMagick=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cconvert=E2=80=9D.
By default, timelines are produced =E2=80=98left to right=E2=80=99, with =
claimed =E2=80=98right to left=E2=80=99, =E2=80=99top to bottom=E2=80=99 =
and =E2=80=98bottom to top=E2=80=99 formats - which I haven=E2=80=99t =
tested.
The CSV file can include links which are built into clickable points in =
the final image, at least for SVG, unsure of PNG.

A concern that I have is the creation of the CSV file from Distrowatch =
is opaque. Possibly built by hand. New diagrams are uploaded 2-3 times a =
year.

The Levenez "fishbone" diagram doesn=E2=80=99t seem to be updated with =
Warner Losh=E2=80=99s 2020 =E2=80=9CHidden Early History=E2=80=9D.
Clem Cole=E2=80=99s Big Block diagram shows =E2=80=9Clow-res=E2=80=9D =
diagrams are also very useful, eliminating distracting detail when =
appropriate.

Groklaw from 2004-2009 tried to collect information about the Unix/Linux =
Timelines, but the site is gone now & Wayback machine hasn=E2=80=99t =
picked up many of the detail / comments page.
I=E2=80=99ve no contact with PJ & whoever runs Groklaw now.
Would that data collection contain anything more than TUHS, as it does =
try to include both Linux and Unix?
Any suggestions?

Something extra in the Linux Distro Tree is a notation for people moving =
between projects and tracking forks. Unsure how that=E2=80=99s =
accomplished, and not sure how important that is for Unixes.

TUHS is =E2=80=9CEarly Unix=E2=80=9D, not about Linux.
However, some degree of compatibility between Unix & Linux Timeline =
diagrams might be useful for others if they ever try to join multiple =
trees.
If a timeline / relationship table is constructed, designing it to be =
somewhat compatible will help future people.

I=E2=80=99m not sure about tracking the many descendants of BSD. =
Wikipedia has a list without a timeline	.	=
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_BSD_operating_systems>
Someone may already be being doing this somewhere, I didn=E2=80=99t =
look.

Don=E2=80=99t think modern descendants of BSD should be tracked by a =
Unix Heritage Society, has to be a boundary somewhere.

Some Questions:

1. Is there any benefit in developing a canonical =E2=80=9CUnix =
Timeline=E2=80=9D dataset containing the relationships, allowing =
programatic conversion to diagrams? There might be better tools in the =
future.

	I=E2=80=99d favour tab-separated text files, because they can be =
read / written by Spreadsheets and converted to CSV.
	Warren=E2=80=99s solution of tables & pages is good: there=E2=80=99=
s simply too much information & complexity to capture in simple file =
formats
	The gnuclad solution of providing =E2=80=9CClickable Links=E2=80=9D=
 is useful, if like TUHS, the pages are well maintained.


2. How to cater for:
	- adding extra-fine detail for segments of the timeline (Warner =
Losh)
	- =E2=80=98zooming out=E2=80=99 and providing an overview (Clem =
Cole)
	- some sort of compatibility with known tables, like Linux =
Distro Timeline


3. No simple representation can, or should try, to be =E2=80=9Call =
things to all people=E2=80=9D, there=E2=80=99s too much detail and too =
many events occurred.

	Is there a useful subset of detail that can be captured in a =
simple table?
	There may be useful subsets of the Unix Timeline that show more =
or less detail,
		To support programatic zoom In/Out, an indent or level =
descriptor is required in the table.
		Does anyone have a good data model for that?
