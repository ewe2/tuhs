Are you referring to the slick little ML11-A  (I think it was an -A when 
I installed it at NY Telephone on
West Street, next to the World Trade Center...

I seem to remember it being used as an RS04 (or similar) fixed head disk 
replacement for swap -- but
it could've been used for temp.

Funny seeing a fault light on a Massbus controller'd box of mostly MK11 
memory.
IIRC it had write-lock as well.

Neat idea and I wish someone would come up with a really large SSD with 
a writelock for archival storage
of my stuff.  No head crashes and if I could disable the possibility of 
accidental writing...
