I can't answer your question, but I can tell you that there was
a UNIX 4.0 inside the Bell System.  The policy at the time (1983) was to
release externally one release behind the current internal release.
That changed with UNIX 5.0 which was released internally and externally
at the same time, becoming System V.

Then the marketing people got involved, and didn't want System VI as
the next release, so they went to System V Release 2, 3, and 4.

As to previewing your talk, why not?
