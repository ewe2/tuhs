BSD had networking.  Once you had that, you don't look back.  Sys V (and
prior) so far as I know, didn't get networking until Coherent did their
STREAMS stack that somehow ended up at Lachman - I ported it to a crazy
super computer and to SCO Unix.  SCO was pretty stock AT&T code and let
me tell you, it felt pretty crappy after having used BSD and then SunOS.
It was a giant step backwards.

I just think the BSD folks were moving forward faster.  Rob with start
talking about cat waving its tail, I get it, not everything was better
but a lot was.  Solid networking that performed was very pleasant.
