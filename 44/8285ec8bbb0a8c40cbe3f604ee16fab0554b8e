Here's the policy for the machine holding the PUPS Archive:
 
        + People with UNIX source licenses can get at least
          guest FTP access to the archive, with S/Key as the
          authentication mechanism.
 
        + People with UNIX source licenses, and who either
          help to maintain the archive, or who have volunteered
          to distribute the archive, can get ssh access to the
          machine.
 
        + No telnet access, no e-mail. The box runs with `reserved
          tolerance' from the real system administrators :-)
 
If you fall into either category, and can prove you have a UNIX source
license, then I can either PGP e-mail you, or fax you, the access 
details. 
 
Apologies for the cross-post to the 3 old UNIX-related mailing lists!
 
Cheers,
        Warren
