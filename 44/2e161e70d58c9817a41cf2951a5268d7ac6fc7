The WIZ hack was well known by the time the worm exploited it.    I=E2=80=99=
d recompiled sendmail to get rid of it even being an option on all the =
machines directly under my control.    The 750 in question was operated =
ostensibly by the JVNCNet people, but I had the root pasword (I guess I =
really didn=E2=80=99t need it with that security hole in it anyhow).
