Run an incremental backup and/or copy the files you new you we were messing
with.  The good news was that patch makes backups.

It was so of.  It was a way to send files around that people could easily
execute and you new would work through 7-bit based email which is all the
SMTP guaranteed in the early days.   Yeh but .. uucp was 8 yep.  But some
of the legs of the USENET were luck to be based on Arpanet site, which
might have had a mailer running BITNET.  When shar was created the 'least
needed' style assumptions were used.   As it was it was often that people
put tarballs, then compressed them and then uuencoded them inside.  Often a
space savings and made it easier -> compressed tar was pretty good, and
even with the 3 8-bit chars as 4 6-bit chars of uuencode it will worked out
well in practice.
