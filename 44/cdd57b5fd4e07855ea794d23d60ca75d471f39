Ex-FAA?  Airport radar?  Those puppies are *powerful*.

ObReminisce: Back in the 70s-80s, the University of NSW put its new 
computer centre on the top floor of a 14-floor building (they were afraid 
of student riots at the time[*]), within clear view of Sydney Airport; the 
windows were lined with mesh, and you could hear them *click* every time 
the radar swung around.

[*]

Ah yes, the top floor.  The other reason was fear of flooding.  One day, 
the air conditioning sprang a major leak, and this corrosive green liquid 
ended up all over the brand spanking new high-speed CDC card reader...
