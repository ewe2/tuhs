You can use puts too, at least in v7.

The system call interface between V6 and V7 changed as well...  Some
internal AT&T branches
(cb unix for one) could run both V6 and V7 binaries. BSD uses the v7 system
call interface through
2.10.x. 2.11 moves to a new system call interface as well. There's niggles
in these statements, since
it isn't quite exactly the same, but for things like this it's ok.

V7 also moved to stdio completely. V6 had precursor routines to stdio and
mesg() was dropped in
that whole process.
