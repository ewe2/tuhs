which error messages?

This might have corrupted your lib files. These two lines are only meant as
templates to replace some files in your archives, that is lib[12], if necessary.
But replacing an object file is necessary only if you changed the corresponding 
source file and recompiled it.

Here are the files supposed to be in lib1:
# ar t lib1
main.o
alloc.o
iget.o
prf.o
rdwri.o
slp.o
subr.o
text.o
trap.o
sig.o
sysent.o
clock.o
fio.o
malloc.o
nami.o
pipe.o
sys1.o
sys2.o
sys3.o
sys4.o


>
>I have these missing symbols
># ld -x l.o m40.o c.o ../lib1 ../lib2
>Undefined:
>_end (defined by ld if successful)
>_edata (same)
>_iinit (from alloc.c)
>_iget (from iget.c)

replace lib1 and lib2 with the original files and it should work!

You might want to consult
