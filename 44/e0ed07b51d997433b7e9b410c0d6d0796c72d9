That would be neat.

For those of us who have moved on from CVS, I have mirror of the
code at https://github.com/arnoldrobbins/pcc-revived.

I tend to sync it with the CVS about once a week.  There hasn't been
much activity on it in the past few weeks.

It's noticeably faster than GCC but I wouldn't say 100x. :-)
