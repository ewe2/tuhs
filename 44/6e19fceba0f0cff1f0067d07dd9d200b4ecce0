Hi -

	And even then the disklabel changes to the HK (rk06/7) driver have
	not been actually tested - the site that was going to do that had
	equipment failures and that combined with the lack of interest in
	or curiosity about PDP-11s resulted the the entire 11 collection being
	scrapped.

	So, I went and make the changes anyhow and they "should work" since
	adding disklabel support to a driver is mostly a boilerplate type of
	activity but there's always the chance that an error crept in.

	Disklabel support for the XP (rp03/4/5/6/7) driver is known to work
	well.

	'fraid I haven't been _that_ route before.

	What I would do today, given the presence of a Qbus SCSI adaptor in the
	system, is either 

	   1) Use a cheesy old 4mm drive (I've a Sony SDT5000 that's too small
	      and/or slow today for the Intel system - upgrade it to an 8mm
	      drive), hook that up to the PC and blast the 2.11BSD boot kit
	      on it (using the instructions, etc provided in the PUPS archive).
	      Then move the 4mm drive over to the PDP-11 and boot the tape .

	    2) Get a SCSI Zip drive, hook it up to the "PC" and use one of the
	       emulators to create a ~96mb image of a system containing the
	       standalone utilities + dump of root fs + tar  files for usr.
	       Then march the Zip drive over to the PDP-11 and boot.   Instead
	       of specifying "tape file numbers" to the standalone programs
	       (as in "tms(0,1)") you would use "ra(1,0)disklabel" and so on.

	A Zip drive is _real nice_ to have on the 11/73 - the Zip is actually
	quite a bit faster than an RD53/RD54 and the media and drives are
	cheap for Zips (Internal SCSI zip drives and a 3.5" shoebox run perhaps
	$150 or so).

Like I said, I tried #2 there, and failed.  But it is possible to do?
That's all I was really after.

Halt address coming in about 1/2 hour or an hour, depends on when they're
done with the cord.

Oh, and a Qbus SCSI card in this box would likely go FUMP!
This is an 11/44.

I plan on taking pictures sometime. ^_^

	Oh, it _should_ work - so yes, it's possible if all the underlying
	pieces are in place.  

	Hmmm, rather than trying to use a pre-existing RP06 disk image 
	perhaps it would be better to get the tape images (should be
	in the pups archive) and use 'makesimtape' or whatever to create
	a bootable tape image for one of the emulators.  Going thru a 
	"cold install" to create a disk image should work.

	You do have floating point hardware in the 11/44, correct?

	Doh!   That's what comes from dashing off a mail item  in a rush
	to go off to lunch ;)

[Use an image built from an install tape...]

I did.

[Have floating point?]

Yup.  Floating point and I'm one memory board short of 2 meg of RAM.
(I'm at 19xx bytes, forgot the exact number.)

It's looping around at 157702.

157702 contains 001776
