OK, that would be great to have online. I _think_ the hardcopy I have
(somewhere! :-) is that report, but my memory should not be trusted.

The people working on TCP/IP did know of the Spider work (like they knew of
the Cambridge ring work), but it didn't really have any impact; it was a
totally different direction than the one we were going in.

V4?! Wow. I'd have never guessed it went that far back.

Yes, I looked and found the original source, appended below.


    >>> Could that be the tiu sys call (#45) in the sysent.c table for V4-V6?

I wonder if we'll ever be able to find a copy of the kernel code for that
tiu() system call. And I wonder what it did?

Remember, that source came from the MIT system, which is a modified PWB1.
So it's not surprising it's using PWB1 system calls.
