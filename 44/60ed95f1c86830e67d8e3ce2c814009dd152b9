I really should stop using Gmail's web interface and find an MUA that
has a "reply to list" feature and defaults to replying to the list for
messages from the list (it would presumably need explicit filters to
detect messages from some lists because not all lists use the
List-Post header). It's annoying when I try to reply to the list and
instead end up replying to only the poster (I know about the problems
with Reply-To munging; I'm not sure why it isn't more common for MUAs
to have a "reply to list" feature to better deal with lists that don't
munge Reply-To).
