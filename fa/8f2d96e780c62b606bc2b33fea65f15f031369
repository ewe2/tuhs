In the first page:

THIS VERSION WAS PRODUCED BY REVERTING THE SEVENTH
EDITION KERNEL SOURCE CODE AND A PROGRAM WRITTEN TO
GENERATE THE INDEX AND CROSS REFERENCE
BY BRIAN S. WALDEN	WH 3A-327	AUGUST 1998
                                               ^^^^

Note two details:
	This is not the original Lion's text (1998)
and the code is not the original v6 code, but rather
a reversion of v7 to v6 done by BSW.

	See the main page 

	v6.cuzuco.com/

where he clearly states it is a "superset" of actual v6
and the TUHS April archives of the mailing list for more
details.
