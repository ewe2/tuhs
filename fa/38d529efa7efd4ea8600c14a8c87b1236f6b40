But since you've created that problem for yourself by your own voluntary choice
to honor copyrights, you shouldn't be asking others for a solution.

Legally by whose law? It is legal by the Law of Hammurabi, King of Babylon by
the way of Anu, Enlil, and Marduk. [1]

[1]	Lofty Anu, lord of the gods
	who from Heaven to Earth came,
	and Enlil, lord of Heaven and Earth
	who determines the destinies of the land,
	Determined for Marduk, the firstborn of Enki,
	the Enlil-functions over all mankind;
	Made him great among the gods who watch and see,
	Called Babylon by name to be exalted,
	made it supreme in the world;
	And established for Marduk, in its midst,
	an everlasting kingship.
