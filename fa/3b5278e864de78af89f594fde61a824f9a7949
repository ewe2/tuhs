Peter=E2=80=99s code is available in the V8 and V9 trees on TUHS.

The Sys V repositories on Github appear to include RFS code in all of =
R3.0, R3.1 and R3.2.

At first glance, it seems quite different from the V8/V9 code.

Yes, well put. I=E2=80=99ve back ported his filesystem switch to V6/V7 =
and it is very light touch: on the PDP11 it added only some 500 bytes of =
kernel code (after some refactoring).

With hindsight it seems such a logical idea, certainly in a context =
where the labs were experimenting with remote system calls in the mid =
70=E2=80=99s (Heinz Lycklama's work on satellite Unix) and early 80=E2=80=99=
s (Gottfried Luderer et al. on distributed Unix =E2=80=94 another =
forgotten version). It is such a powerful abstraction, but apparently =
very elusive to invent.
