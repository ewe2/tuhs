may I suggest taking a look into this package:

http://homepages.fh-giessen.de/~hg53/pdp11-unix/unix-v7-3.tar.gz

I tried to be very specific as to how things
are to be done (but I also refer to the manual
pages of V7 for setting up the system of course).
All parts that you need to get V7 up and running
from the original tape images (also included) are
there, as well as the manuals for V7 and for the
PDP11-40. Also included is a file extractor, which
can be used to extract files from the simulated
file system to the Linux host file system.

Good luck!
Hellwig
