I've long forgotten the name of the work.    I worked on the proposal and
part of the design study, but not the project itself.  I had my hands full
with leading the HP and DEC TNC stuff.  IIRC Joe Hopfield was the lead on
it.     It was not really in the key of WINE.  It was sort of cross
between UWIN and Interix POSIX subsystem that now ships as WSL.  I've
forgotten a lot of the details now, to be honest.  I seem to remember they
used the SLS as part of the scheme, but I think there was a 'process' that
was booted under OS/400 that took serviced UNIX/POSIX processes system
functions.  I'll send a note a couple of LCC alumni and see if I can find
someone that knew more about it.
