And that's what I for one want to see.  The more Un*x branches we have in 
preservation for study purposes, the less chance a software pirate like The 
Societe Commercial du Ondit (The Rumormongers Company) Group has of 
succeeding in meritless law suits.

I think someone should ask Novell to consider declaring the Un*x SySVRx source 
tree available under the GPL or some such license.  And releasing OSF/1 and 
such SVRx derivatives from requiring a Un*x source code license, if they want 
to release their ancient source trees for preservation purposes.

It would be a fitting end to the AT&T Un*x role in computer science history.
