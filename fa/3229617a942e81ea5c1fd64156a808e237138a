Looking at the first file as well as the later 512 byte files, this appears
to have been made on an RT-11 system.  There are entries for HDR1ZEROED.ZZZ
which shows up in the RT-11 5.07 sources:
http://www.kpxx.ru/DEC/PDP-11/Software/OS/RT-11/05.07/05.07.abl/Unpacked/DUPZMC.MAC
.  Unfortunately I have absolutely no experience with magtapes under RT-11
so I'm not currently sure how to proceed.
