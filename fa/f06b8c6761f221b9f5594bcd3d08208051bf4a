Mike Haertel:

  That's amusing, considering that the 5620 stuff was in /usr/jerq on
  Research systems!  Apparently the accident became institutionalized.

=====

I remember the name Jerq being tossed around to mean 5620
when I was at 1127.  That doesn't mean it was historically
accurate, but it is consistent with the directory names, and
the latter are probably where I got my mistaken idea of the
history.

Thanks to Rob, who certainly should know, for clearing it up.
