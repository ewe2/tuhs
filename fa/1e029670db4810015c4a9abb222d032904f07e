Just out of curiousity, why don't you set the SR before you boot the machine?
That way it'll come up single user, and you can icheck/dcheck before you go
to multi-user mode. I prefer doing it that way, there's as little as possible
going on, in case the disk is slightly 'confused', so less chance any bit-rot
will spread...

No, it's there: the second line (PID 1). For some reason, the code for
/etc/init (in V6 at least, I don't know anything about V5) bashes the command
line so it just has '-' in it, so it looks just like a shell.

I fixed my copy so it says "/etc/init", or something like that. The machine
my source is on is powered down at the moment; if you want, I can upload the
'fixed' code tomorrow.

I seem to recall there's some issue, something like in some cases there's an
extra shell left running attached to the console, but I don't recall the
details (too lazy to look for the note I made about the bug; I can look it up
if you really want to know).

I don't usually bother; I just log out all the shells except the one on the
console, so the machine is basically idle; then do a 'sync', and shortly
after than completes, I just halt the machine.
