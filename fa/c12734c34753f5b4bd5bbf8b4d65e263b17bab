No, that would be too much of a coincidence to choose exactly the
same characters.  There has to be a single point of origin, from
which it spread by stimulus diffusion (you hear there are telescopes,
you know they use lenses, you build your own telescope).

Yes, seemingly bash does that too.  Bogus.
