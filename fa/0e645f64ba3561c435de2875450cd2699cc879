Can't remember; we're talking late 70s / early 80s, and my organic 
associative memory ain't the best these days.  I was busy running a 
network of 11/40s, squeezing as much of V7 into V6 as I could, and talking 
the poxy UT-200 protocol for RJE (the original purpose of our 11/40s) with 
its broken implementation on the Cyber 72.

Damn; I wish I still had those CSU tapes, but they'd be unreadable by now 
(IMHO my "ei.c" driver was a work of art).

That rings a bell; we're talking about the early UNSW Unix days (CSU, 
AGSM, Basser, Elec Eng, etc).
