Ah; the chips could explain it.  I can't remember where I heard the story, 
but it was likely in ";login:" or some place.  Hey, if the DEC marketoids 
didn't want 3rd-party UNIBUS implementations then why was it published?

No; it was definitely UNIBUS (I wasn't aware of the SBI at the time).

As for overlapped seeks, when they were implemented in Unix it broke the 
RK-11 controller, and DEC pointed the finger at Unix (of course) since 
their own gear worked.  To cut a long story short, they were forced to use 
some fancy diagnostic (DECEX?) which hammered everything at the same time, 
and the problem showed up.  Turned out that their simpler diagnostics did 
not test for overlapped seeks, because they knew that it didn't work; out 
same the FE to modify the controller...

Yet another reason why DEC went under, I guess...
