Algol 68 had a concept "deproceduring" similar to "dereferencing". If you
think of 

	foo(arg)

where plain "foo" is a pointer to a function and adding the parentheses
does the call, then it's the same with a procedure name or with
a function pointer.

This is pretty much what BLS said.  Thinking of [] and () as operators
is explicit in C++ (for good and for ill).
