Doug, I'm trying to understand the provenance of that paper. It appears to
be a variant of a part of CSTR #155, but it is not the same as "Ellipses
Not Yet Made Easy" from that report. It also appears that this particular
document is a scan; is it perhaps a pre-print version of the paper? Or
perhaps it was expanded from what was published in #155?
