Time to move into the 21st century.  Tcsh has been obsolete for decades.

Myself, when first exposed to the csh, I revolted (and was revolted) and
stuck with the Bourne shell, even though there was no job control or
history.

I later ported Ron Minnich's job control from the BRL S5R2 on top of BSD shell
to the plain BSD shell and also wrote my own !-style history editor for
it. (Both were posted on USENET in the early 80s.)

After that I got ksh86 and later ksh88, with vi-style command line
editing and never looked back. Then, in the early 90s when I no longer
had ksh access, I switched to bash, contributed fixes to readline's vi
mode, and have been with bash since.

(For a while I tried rc + readline, but that just didn't do it for me.
Bash all the way. Zsh is too different in its vi mode.)

And kudos to Chet for dealing with all the POSIX zigzags ("clarifications",
"definitions") for the shell over the decades. I admire him, but I
don't envy him.

My two cents,

Arnold
