Interesting. When I played with 2.11BSD a few years ago I found that it
only did a "fast" boot if rebooted with "shutdown -rf". A cold boot
would always drop into single user and allow running fsck manually.

IIRC /boot or even one of the earlier bootstrap stages would check a
certain memory location for certain values, which the kernel(?) would
place there in the reboot syscall. As I wanted to always force a fast
boot, I had this in my simh.ini to force a fast boot:

d 157772 177777
d 157774 002400
d 157776 000000

If you're using a simulator I wouldn't be suprised if it does that
automatically nowadays, of perhaps 2.11BSD was patched a while back to
reverse that behaviour.

I don't remember what these values do, though. And you want to do the
opposite anyway. But perhaps this helps you find out more.
