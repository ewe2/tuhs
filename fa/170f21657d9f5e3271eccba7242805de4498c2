Couldn=E2=80=99t find the Condensed Guide on the Multicians site.

There was a thread on QED, October 2018

On the Multician site, there was information about qedx - a =
reimplementation, if I read correctly.
Ken is noted as the author of QED, but no docs are linked.

QED
CTSS editor written by Ken Thompson. This  line-oriented editor was =
influenced by the character-oriented QED editor on the SDS-940; one of =
Ken's major additions was regular expression searching and substitution. =
Ported to Multics BCPL by Ken and Dennis Ritchie. Bob Daley then wrote =
Multics qedx as a less functional but faster version. Both qed and qedx =
are programmable: they support multiple buffers, and a user can execute =
the contents of a buffer containing editor commands. Doug McIlroy wrote =
a version of tic-tac-toe in qed. Qedx was the standard editor for most =
of the Multics development community throughout the 70s. Info segment =
for qedx command See ted.

[BSG] The qedx language was unambiguously optimized for interactive =
line-editing, not programming, thus writing non-trivial QEDX "macros" =
(programs) was a black art whose results where very ugly and =
non-maintainable and often bordered on black humor. Compare TECO. ted, =
adding many more commands, is one direction of solution. edm, having no =
programming language, is another. [perl, with no editing language, is =
another point on the scale -- THVV] Having entirely distinct command and =
extension languages is now almost universally considered to be the =
correct solution to problems of this sort (e.g., Emacs).

[THVV] A nice history of QED, its descendants, and the use of regular =
expressions is in  Russ Cox's article.

TEXT ADDRESSING

QED accepts commands and text as a stream of characters from the =
console.
Text within the current buffer is specified by (1) line addresses or (2) =
strings (regular-expressions) in the text 1 ine.

Lines in the current buffer may be addressed in the following ways:
	1. by current line number
	2. by absolute line number
	3. by the value of the current line (".")
	4. by the special character (=E2=80=9C$=E2=80=9D)
	5. by context
	6. by additive combinations of methods 1. to 5.
