No, It was the name choosen to spearhead the new opensource movement of 
Caldera after purchase of SCO divisions from the OLD SCO.  There were only 
3-12 people outside SCO that new about the soon to be released email list.  
It was an NDA list, sadly I can not reproduce the copies because of the 
idiot that over wrote over 750 GB of disk with "DIE SCO DIE SCO".  I was 
not backing up NDA stuff.  But if you can get the Forum Presenations from 
the year Caldera purchased SCO assests and the next one you will see their 
agenda to OpenSource everything clearly stated.  Ransome Love if my memory 
is correct was CEO at the time.

No, not rummors or hearsey.  I was in the meetings where it was discussed.  
There were the IBM reps, SCO reps and a few others.   This was just prior 
to the big show.  The next day IBM came in and said they would not 
opensource the stuff.  All the press released were trashed and then the 
battle began.

You were not there and did not live through what was happening.  I was.  I 
know others were as well.  It was not vaporware.  It was also part of the 
new United Linux.  SUSE was there, as well as the other members of the 
colliation.  It was a sad day when it all happened.  It was to be part of 
the big announcement of United Linux.
