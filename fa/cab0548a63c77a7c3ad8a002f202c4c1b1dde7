Indeed -- a small step in the right direction by ACM, but don't be too
excited.   If you go to the ACM DL website, sadly, most of the library is
still behind the paywall (or not scanned).  I do still have access
from Intel, but when I retire, I think I will lose that access - even
though I'm a long-time ACM (and IEEE) member.  In fact, the thing about ACM
and IEEE that frosts my cookies the most is that I already paid for these
journals.   [My wife would love it if I got rid of them from the basement,
but if I do, I lose that investment].

FWIW: the single item that I am the proudest of when I was USENIX President
was opening access to its entire library to everyone - members or
otherwise.   This meant taking a leap of faith by the org that people would
stay members - as it does cost the USENIX money to be there for us all (so
I highly encourage people on this list to consider it to support the work
they continue to do -- https://www.usenix.org/membership).
