Hi.

I suspect this was true mainly at Research, where the whole place was
not large. Other people, as pointed out, found groups to be very useful.

Yes, at 4.2 BSD. The so-called group set.

No. Your process simply carried around a bunch of groups with it, and if
the group of the directory matched the primary group or a member of the
group set, you got group permission.

IIRC this was a Sun invention. It was in SunOS 4.x, and may even have
been in SunOS 3.x.

Also a SunOS invention, IIRC.

Timeline is late 80s, SunOS 4.0, I believe. (Larry? :-)

These ideas later propogated into SVR4 / Solaris, Linux and most (if not all)
the other proprietary Unixes.

HTH,
