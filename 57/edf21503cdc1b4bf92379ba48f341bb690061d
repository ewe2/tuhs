No, it shouldn't, but I'm confused as to where you're doing this at.
Is this on FreeBSD?

This must have something to do with the 2.11BSD disk label.  The raw
character device should be writable, can you try rm'ing the appropriate
entries and remaking them with /dev/MAKEDEV?

Also note that you may have to issue a disklabel command to make it
possible for you to clobber the sectors where the disk label would otherwise
live.

Yes, there is a physical<->logical block interleave on the RX50.  See, for
example, John Wilson's PUTR source code ( at ftp://ftp.dbit.com/pub/ibmpc/putr/
- assuming that ftp.dbit.com is back up by now!) for details and
example code.

That's true, the RQDX3 takes care of all that.  If you look at any DEC
Professional RX50 driver source code, you'll see the interleave code in there.
For example, from RT-11's DZ.MAC sources:

;
; In standard RT-PC mode, a 2:1 interleave is used on a single track and
; a 2 sector skew is used across tracks.

("RT-PC" means "RT-11 on a DEC Professional", roughly!)

and later, in a breathtaking example of tight driver interleave code
(really, study it very closely, this is good stuff!):

; Normal I/O, convert block number to track and sector number and interleave
;
        ASL     R2              ;Make word count unsigned byte count
        MOV     (PC)+,R4        ;Loop count for 8 bit division
         .BYTE  -7.,-10.        ;Count becomes 0, -10 in high byte for later

60$:    ROL     R5              ;Shift dividend and quotient
        INCB    R4              ;Decrement loop count

The DEC RX33 floppy drive *is* a TEAC FD55GFR, also commonly found
on PC-clones.

Not just *any* HD AT floppy drive will work.  Not only does it need
to support the drive select jumpers, it also needs a bit more jumper
configurability.  The exact jumper settings vary depending on which
exact FD55 model and revision you're using.  As of a few months
ago many of the jumper setting legends were decoded on the spec sheets
you could get from TEAC's faxback service.

>I'm afraid you'd have to ask Mentec. 

No, Mentec doesn't (generally) own the rights to those.  Mentec owns the
rights to several former DEC OS's, most notably RT-11, RSX-11M, RSX-11M+,
and RSTS/E, and many of the corresponding layered products.  But they
don't even own all the former DEC PDP-11 software; for instance, they
don't have XXDP, DOS-11, PAL-11, etc...

Of probable interest to many of the readers of this mailing list,
Mentec is gearing up to offer a hobbyist license for the RT, RSX-11M, RSX-11M+,
and RSTS/E.  Note, in particular, that there is a "PDP-11 Hobbyist" link
on Mentec's page at

  http://www.mentec.com/mentecinc/default.asp

The link is currently disabled, but I expect it'll be active in the next
week or so.

Yes, there is a software interleave on RX50 diskettes. It also varies 
from system
to system; I'm pretty certain PDP-11s and VAXes use the same software 
interleave
(otherwise you couldn't exchange diskettes between a Pro350 and a MicroVAX II),
but the DECmate II and III use a different software interleave. I 
have a memo here
somewhere; it's getting a bit faded, perhaps I should do an underground HTML
translation of it... Ah yes, here it is:

DEC format supported by RQDX controller (this is 1984, so the only 
RQDX controller
is RQDX1 at the time) used by Pro300, Micro-PDPs, MicroVAX I:

- 10 sectors per track
- 2 for 1 interleaving with 3 to 1 intercylinder skew
- Physical track # = (LBN/10) + 1 with wraparound to track 0 [IOW, logical
   track 0 is physical track 1 and physical track 0 is logical track 79]
- Physical sector # = X ( m ) where m = LBN mod 50, n = m/10, c = m mod 10:

        |c=0|c=1|c=2|c=3|c=4|c=5|c=6|c=7|c=8|c=9|
     ---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

DECmates and Rainbows don't use an intercylinder skew. Rainbows have the
whacky logical track wrapping while DECmates don't.

Yes, the RQDX3 is supposed to do this for you so you don't have to deal
with it, unless you're foolishly trying to read DECmate or Rainbow disks
on an RQDX3, at which point you need to carefully figure out how the lack
of intercylinder skew on the DECmates interacts with the cylinder skew
on the RQDX3.

I know the RQDX3 implements the soft interleave because I did the firmware
for Digital's SCSI floppy controller. I maintained that the device driver
should deal with the interleave because it varies from format to format and
the SCSI controller can't tell whether a particular RX50 is a DECmate RX50
or a VAX RX50. VMS didn't want to deal with the soft interleave because they
don't have to on the RQDX3. I lost the fight and had to go back into the
SCSI controller and rev the firmware to deal with the soft interleave.

No, it shouldn't, at least AFAIK.

This shouldn't be a problem. There are some potential difficulties
involving the gap lengths; IIRC it's possible to format floppies that
work on a PC but don't work with the HDC 9224 used on the RQDX3 because
the 9224 requires a little bit more time to clean itself up in one of
the gaps. Unfortunately, I don't recall the details; this was all a long
time ago. I think it involves the gap between the header and data fields of
a sector, but don't hold me to that.

That's good. You should not be using high-density disks.

What sort of info are you looking for? Floppy drivers are a PITA to write
and you should be happy the RQDX3 is hiding it from you.

>drive (well, any one that sports DS jumpers) on the RQDX3 and it'll

The DEC drive changes speed based on the head write current signal of
the interface. AT drives don't change speed; the data separator on an
AT controller runs at 300KHz for low-density instead of 250KHz to deal
with that little slice o' heaven. If you stick any HD AT drive on an
RQDX3, you may be able to read high-density disks, but you probably will
not be able to read low-density disks (i.e., RX50s).

Oh yeah. Since the DEC drives change speed, that means there's an extra
little slice o' heaven in the floppy support code to wait for the drive
to change speed when the density changes. Are you _sure_ you want
documentation for that little slice o' heaven?

Well, that disagrees with this memo right here which specifies a 3:1
interleave. It's hard to argue with code, though, and since I don't have
my 8051 code for the SCSI floppy controller handy, I'll have to believe
Tim on this one.

Gee, let's not forget the old IBM RT-PC dinosaur.....(:+}}...
It was an entirely different beastie by the same name, that I am sure
a few of us have played with over the years.  It's a prime candidate for
the UHS style fodder, if there were any interest in the thing besides
with me.  Anyone else aboard play with that dinosaur critter?

Yes, I would like to see Warren mirror such things, as space and utility
dictate.  Sometimes some redundancy in these forgotten lores is good.
I am sure there are other such docs and texts of wisdom that collectively
we should centralize in the archives, space, copyrights, permissions, etc.,
to be worked out in some way.  At least, link to the urls, as long as the
urls don't break.

A litle note like:
Look at http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/Quasijarus/compress.html to see how
to decompress the files. 
in the FORMAT file can save much time if you are a Quasijarus beginner. 
Or a Link "HOWTO install Quasijarus" with a note about the compress
issue, creating tapes, ... on the Quasijarus main page will do the job
also.

Again. "Look at Distributions/4bsd/components/compress.tar" can save

OK. Tomorrow is a new day, new luck. I will mount the TK50Z in the MVII

will stay inactive until I get a working, 2.11BSD capable PDP11 CPU.

I'd prefer to not put things into the archive unless they were Unix-related.
Notwithstanding that comment, if there's enough disk space, why not.
However, it would have to be in an area which was marked as generic information.

Pointers would go on the web pages (that's easy). Real files in the Archive :-)

As part of the division of things into system/platform-specific and
Unix-generic areas, I'm updating the Unix Heritage Society web pages.
A preview is at http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/tuhs/

We need more affiliated groups! Bob, you want to lead an IBM group?
David, how about an encumbered BSD group? Minnie will provide web space,
archive area, mail list as required.

The web page above is the place to put pointers to hardware information
and other useful stuff, unless that has already been done by an affiliated
group. So start sending me URLs :-)

The existing pups at minnie mail list will become the tuhs at minnie list. A
new pups at minnie list will be created for PDP-11 specific stuff. Next week
sometime.

In a month say, I'll reorganise the structure of the PUPS Archive, and
rename it as the Unix Archive. If you have mirrors, don't worry I'll
e-mail out a shell script with lots of mkdir and mv commands in it :-)

Cheers,
	Warren

At present, Michael Sokolov looks after the 4BSD VAX section of the
archive under the aegis of the Quasijarus project. Michael, do you want
to continue to do this? Or should we separate the historical 4BSDs for
someone to curate while you manage the ongoing Quasijarus work?

Hi --

	Wow, quite a bit of interest in 2.11 these days - I suppose I should
	get back into it (too many other projects, etc and so little time ;))

	Not for eons - the RX50 I had was so flakey (well, actually it finally
	got to the point it was declared broke) it was replaced with a 1.2mb
	5.25" Teac "PC" drive).

	No, in fact I'd have expected an error on the first 'dd'.

	Using 'cmp -l' will show where the differences are.   If they are only
	in the first couple sectors but the rest compare ok then I think I
	know what the problem might be.

	I'd also, not that it would make any difference (I hope), use the
	raw device for speed purposes (RX50 is slow enough as it is ;)):

		dd if=testrx50.img of=/dev/rra12a

	Indeed it is related to disklabel support.  In the face of a missing
	or corrupt disklabel the kernel is supposed (and I think it is in this
	case) synthesize a label that spans the entire disk with the 'a'
	partition. 

	I do not know why the first two sectors are not being written if the
	synthetic label is being used.  It's probably a bug having to deal
	with not setting the "enable write for label area" when the fake label
	is being used.  Sigh.   I have a floppy drive on my 11/73 - I'll try
	to find time and play around before going on vacation in a couple weeks.

	The first sector should have been written (that's the boot block), the
	label sector is the 2nd sector and that's 'write protected' unless
	either an ioctl() is done or the 'disklabel' program is used to
	un-writeprotect it.

	Try doing a 

		disklabel -W /dev/rra12a

	to enable writing the label sector.  If that works then the problem
	lies in not setting that bit when a corrupt/missing label is seen.

	Normally this isn't necessary since filesystems are created on disks
	and they're not treated as raw output bitcontainers.  Floppies are
	special in that 'raw' device usage is more common.

> Finally, I noticed there is no floppy-specific code in the MSCP driver, so
> all the gory details of floppy control (along with the gory details of the

	Quite so.  To the driver the RX50 is just another MSCP disk.  

	Oh, for debugging purposes you can enable more or all of the MSCP
	messages with the 'sysctl' command:

		sysctl -w machdep.mscp.printf=X

		where X is a bitmask (at present only the first 4 bits are in
		use).   Setting X to 15 will enable every printf the driver
		has.  

 * Bit 0 = print/log all non successful response packets
 * Bit 1 = print/log datagram arrival
 * Bit 2 = print status of all response packets _except_ for datagrams
 * Bit 3 = enable debug/log statements not covered by one of the above

	See the pdpuba/ra.c sources for more details, and what printf/log
	statements are covered by which bit.

No, I do not and will not separate these.

Warren, can we talk about all this sometime later, leaving the affected areas

Well... No... But...

You later note that 2.11 don't write the first two sectors, even though it
don't give you any errors. So, I'm not surprised by the result. the first
1K are probably very different. Try to compare everything after that 1K
and see if that is the same.

NetBSD-current runs well on VAXstations 3100 and 4000m{60,90}. OK, it
is no pure BSD in Michaels sense and it is not that lean. But it is a
good OS, free, modern, ...

After looking at the data, I'm not suprised, either -- I've proven, if
nothing else, that the 'diff' command is not broken :) This command
seek-whence was for illusutrative purposes; by far the strangest thing to
me is the Interleave Problem. First R/W UNIX block device I've ever seen
that's not bijective (to slightly abuse the term).

It's the first PDP operating system I've enjoyed working with, and one of
the coolest UNIX implementations I've had the pleasure of working with.
Every programmer who writes 150MB bloatware should study it.

I unearthed two Teac 55-G series floppy drives, and they're both broken
(won't format w/verify) -- the RX50 isn't the only flakey floppy. I've got
a few Toshibas and Matsushitas I'm gonna fool around with, though. Though
I find that about 90% of what I learn about everything computer related
involves one thing or another that doesn't work; so in a way I can thank
DEC for screwball H/W. About 10 YA, I used a DECmate II with an RX50 on a
daily basis, and had 0 problems; of course, I had preformatted DEC disks
and no interchange (at the time I had two computers -- an Atari 130XE and
DECmate II)

Some is, some ain't. Aside from the also-mentioned "interleave problem,"
whereby the RX50 seems to interleave output data (isn't the hardware
supposed to take care of this, if it is indeed hardware interleave, 
though I'm 95% sure I formatted 1:1...yes, unless the RQDX3 is unlike
_every_ floppy controller I've seen in the past ten years)

I, also, although I'm not going on vacation in the near future, and I
don't have an 11/73 -- but, I suppose if I can find time to play with my
PDP @ all (which I suppose I have -- it's now, courtesy of Network Address
Translation and SLIP, not only connected to my Apartment Network, but also
to the Internet. Now to find a Web browser that fits in 64K I space or
segments well. Is CERN line-mode still being maintaned?), I'll work on
this. I hope to be able to use the RX50 for sneakernet purposes, despite
my network connection, as 19.2K is pretty damned slow, and while I'm
excited at the prospect of diviplexing SLIP over all 40 ports on all five
of my muxes, I'm somewhat less excited at the prospect of designing and
coding it; besides, I only have three serial ports on my PC, and one's for
the modem). Though Priority One is getting my LA75 working -- once again
It Worked In RSX (much better than I did, I might add :).

I will. Thanks. I didn't even know 2.11 had 'sysctl'. Cool.

Yup.. But only with 4.3BSD on it.

The assembly mnemonics stil crack me up. Seems like IBM somehow
misunderstood 'RISC' for Reduced Mnemonics.

The comments inserted in assembly code by the C compiler gave some
indication of the brokenness of the CPU.. Lots of NOP's added in several
places with remarks like "Add NOPs, otherwise register contents will be wrong".

But hey...

Before that I was used to working with 40 students on a uVAX 3600
(which I now own and run :-), so to me these RT's were pretty darn
quick!

Still would like to get my grubby paws on one though. Somehow this 
collection of old UNIX machines is becoming an obsession :-)
