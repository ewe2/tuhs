Yes. Thanks.  I do remember it in 6 and the hack in cc to run it or not(it
took years for me to break the habit of starting a C program with a #) but
what I don=E2=80=99t remember was it in v5 - which we only ran briefly (I
personally never saw V4 either although I know Columbia and I believe
Harvard had it)
