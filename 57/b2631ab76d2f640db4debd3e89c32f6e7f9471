Subject: [TUHS] Origin of 'kill -9'?
Message-ID: <CAEoi9W6OKH0NTpWj9=AHqW5+-EJAvN1aF+uQVee0wQDbFbuS-A@mail.gmail.com>

I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that this just occurred to me. Is the
reason that SIGKILL has the numeric value 9 because cats are reported to
have nine lives? Clearly the connection between 'cat' and 'kill -9' would
make for a irreverent but harmless inside joke if so....
