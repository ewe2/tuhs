Boy, I'm amazed at the controversy here.   Yeah, I thought the feature was odd when it appeared, but it's not nearly as bizarre as the perils of allowing random users to mount disks (we hacked our mostly V6 kernel at JHU to disable setuid on mounted disks)  or the fact that non-privileged users could invoke setuid/setgid (managed to exploit a few bugs here in the day).
