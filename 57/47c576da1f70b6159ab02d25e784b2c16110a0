Subject: [TUHS] RAND editor e19
Message-ID: <45a02f23.DpvriVG9cjfLRrXZ%gunnarr@acm.org>

Hi,

does anyone still have the source code for the RAND editor
e19 <http://www.rand.org/pubs/notes/N2239-1/>? One can read
on the net that it was once available as public domain from
ftp.rand.org, but this machine seems not available anymore.

There is an archive rand.tar.Z in the 2.10 (BSD) directory of
CSRG CD 1, but this contains the older version e14. I think
it would be good to also have the final version e19 in the
Unix archive.

Thanks

	Gunnar
