Message-ID: <428D9F65.9040605@icpnet.pl>

Hi,
I have added test version of binary kernel for Coherent 4.2.10 with
support for fixed 128 MB RAM(tested on 300 MHZ system).
Check

http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~apopiele/embed.html.

I have approval of the owner of Coherent, so it is legal to download and
use this kernel.
