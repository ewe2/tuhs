Subject: [TUHS] early version of top
Message-ID: <20111219111448.Horde.a30SW6Qd9PdO7w6Y6fFbxzA@avocado.salatschuessel.net>


Hi,

I wonder if someone has an early version of top lying around? I'd
like to try getting it to work on my ZEUS clone. I'd start with
1.0 from 1984 if possible ;)

   Regards, Oliver
