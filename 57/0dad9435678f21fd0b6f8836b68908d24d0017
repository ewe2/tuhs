Seems about as fast as I remember the hardware being, but that was
well over 25 years ago, so I don't know for sure.

Yes, Georgia Tech got 3B2s and 3B20s. An instructor there referred to the
3B20s as white elephants, and explained it to me (since I didn't know):
A white elephant is something obviously rare and valuable, but what
exactly do you do with it? :-)

Ours had a bunch of the CDC 300 Meg washing machine disk drives. A huge
amount of storage for the time. We (the lab staff) wanted to port BSD
Unix to them, but that never went anywhere.

I remember occasionally just pulling the plug...

The 3B1 was a pleasure in comparison. Afforadable on a personal level
and eminently usable.
