You are right: 000137. The funny thing is, I had it right the first time.
I'll go update the web page.

On the other header fields, I agree with your idea, but for some reason, I
have this vague recollection that there was a reason for what I did with
them. It's always a bad idea to second guess something you did a year ago
and "fix" it (see the 000137 thing). It's working, so I'd best leave it
alone until it's proven to be broken. I think I remember setting it up that
way after reading through the source for some boot loader.

Hmm, yes, it was the "boot" program. VTserver squirts down a small loader
via ODT, which then loads boot.dd. Same as the boot program that the 512
byte rauboot program loads. This one:

73Boot from ra(0,0,0) at 0172150
: ra(0,0,0)unix

 Boot.dd knows enough to chat with the console so you can tell it what file
you want off the virtual tape or hard drive, and it does some decoding of
the header, but it's limited. Maybe I should go read that code again.
