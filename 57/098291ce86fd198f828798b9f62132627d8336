Well the obvious next step is to patch the kernel to do the backing up
and erasing.

I implemented this for myself once, but I've lost the code since then. I
*think* the right place is in tty.c, around line 489 (that's where it
currently handles the special echo rule for the kill character, anyway).
You'll just want to check for the erase character (and the same modes
that are checked for the kill character) and echo
backspace/space/backspace.
