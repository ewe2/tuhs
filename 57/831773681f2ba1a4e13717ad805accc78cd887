I believe the SEP RELAG-3 system (www.sep.de) is based on LSI-11, not sure
it is written in assembler, though. Perhaps Torsten could tell ...

Let me toss in another possibility.  Around that time (late 70's -
early 80's) we (Marine Physical Lab) were running an RT-11 emulator on
a couple of our PDP-11 Unix systems.  Product of Human Computing
Resources, as I remember.  Once you can emulate RT-11, you can run all
of its CUSPs:  assembler, linker, Fortran, what have you.  Assuming, of
course, that you have appropriate licenses etc.

We did it to get a reasonably capable Fortran compiler with our Unix.
