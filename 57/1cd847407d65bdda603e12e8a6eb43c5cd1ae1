Absolutely!  Even MERT documentation would be interesting.  The other  
two systems you mention are probably interesting too, except that I've  
never even heard about them so I can't say.

For the record, I've posted a couple of times to the list asking  
various esoteric questions about virtualization.  That's why I'm  
interested in MERT in particular.
