Clem, thanks a lot for writing this. I think I have connected few dots
now. Like, I was long aware that there were various groups of computer
users, but never before I had the thought about how this "divide"
contributed so much to creation and adoption of Unix.

I suppose I like Unix even more now.

Ahem. I do not see myself selling or buying during golf
course... Especially if it has to do with computers...

I will see if I can have my hand on it.

I definitely like this attitude.

Yikes. Five kilodollars, what a deal.

When I learned C, in middle/late 80-ties, it was my third language
after Basic and Pascal. I did not have computer at that time and I
wrote short programs in a notebook. I wonder if I could locate the
notebook and if any of this code would run. But, compared to the first
two, C had something fresh in it. Nowadays, however, this freshness is
a little bit trapped under a ton of supporting libraries. Back at the
time, the fact there was a C compiler on every computer I heard about,
and standard library gave it a bit of unified look, and I could write
C oneliners on less paper, more idiomatic (saves time! all those
begin/end words replaced by mere curly braces, very nice) - all of
this made C very interesting to me.

I hope C would have been invented even without Unix.
