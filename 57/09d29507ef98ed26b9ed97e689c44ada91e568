Quite the opposite happened to me in Britain. I wanted to
import an early computer-generated film to show. When I
inquired whether there would be any customs implications,
I was asked whether the film was exposed or not. Britain
charged duty only on exposed film.

With apologies for straying ever farther from Unix,
Doug
