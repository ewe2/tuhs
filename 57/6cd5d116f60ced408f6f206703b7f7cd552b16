I can answer some of the below, as I was looking into that a few years =
ago.

> 81. Q:  What was the first Unix network?
> A: spider
> You thought it was Datakit, didn't you? But Sandy Fraser had an =
earlier

>=20
> When did Alexander G Fraser's spider cell network happen? For that =
matter,

Spider was designed between 1969 and 1974 - the final lab report (#23) =
dates from December 1974. It was based around a serial loop running at =
T1 signalling speed (~1.5Mhz). Here is a video recorded by Dr. Fraser =
about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DojRtJ1U6Qzw (first half is =
about Spider, second half about Datakit).

It connected to its hosts via a (discrete TTL-based) microcontroller or =
=E2=80=9CTIU=E2=80=9D and seems to have been connected almost =
immediately to Unix systems: the oldest driver I have been able to =
locate is in the V4 tree =
(https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=3DV4/nsys/dmr/tdir/tiu.c). =
It used a DMA-based parallel interface into the PDP11. As such, it seems =
to have been much faster than the typical Datakit connection later - but =
I know too little about Datakit to be sure.

There is an interesting visit report from 1975 that discusses some of =
the stuff that was done with Spider here: =
https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:rq704hx4375/rq704hx4375.pdf
Beyond those experiments I think Spider usage was limited to file =
serving (=E2=80=99nfs=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98ufs=E2=80=99) and printing =
(=E2=80=99npr=E2=80=99). It would seem logical that it was used for =
remote login, but I have not found any traces of such usage. Same for =
email usage.

=46rom what little I know, I think that Datakit became operational in a =
test network in 1979 and as a product in 1982.

> I  thought the answer was "ARPANET" since we had a NCP on 4th edition =
Unix
> in late 1974 or early 1975 from the University of Illinois dating from =
that
> time (the code in TUHS appears to be based on V6 + a number of =
patches).

=E2=80=9CNetwork Unix=E2=80=9D =
(https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc681.html) was written by Steve =
Holmgren, Gary Grossman and Steve Bunch in the last 3 months of 1974. To =
my best knowledge they used V5 and migrated to V6 as it came along. I =
think they were getting regular update tapes, and they implemented their =
system as a device driver (plus userland support) to be able to keep up =
with the steady flow of updates. Greg Chesson was also involved with =
this Arpanet Unix.

As far as I can tell, Arpanet Unix saw fairly wide deployment within the =
Arpanet research community, also as a front end processor for other =
systems.

A few years back I asked on this list why =E2=80=9CNetwork Unix=E2=80=9D =
was not more enthusiastically received by the core Unix development team =
and (conceptually) integrated into the main code base. I understood the =
replies as that (i) people were very satisfied with Spider; and (ii) =
being part of Bell they wanted a networking system that was more =
compatible with the Bell network, i.e. Datakit.

=3D=3D

In my opinion both =E2=80=9CSpider Unix=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CArpanet =
Unix=E2=80=9D threw a very long conceptual shadow. =46rom Spider =
onwards, the Research systems viewed the network as a device (Spider), =
that could be multiplexed (V8 streams) or even mounted (Plan9). The Arpa =
lineage saw the network as a long distance bidirectional pipe, with the =
actual I/O device hidden from view; this view persists all the way to =
4.2BSD and beyond.

I often wonder if it was (is?) possible to come up with a design with =
the conceptual clarity of Plan9, but organised around the =E2=80=9Cnetwork=
 as a pipe=E2=80=9D view instead.
