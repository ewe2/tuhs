We talked about this before: You are the only person who does not attack me 
when I write that SCCS is much faster than RCS, just because you know ;-)

RCS was not a advantage for the developer community as it's use was based on a 
missunderstanding of properties.

The first system to implement something based on previous good ideas was BK and 
AFAIK, GIT was implemented originally as an empty shelf that aimed to imitate 
the CLI from BK.
