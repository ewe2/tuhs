I believe it's been publicly stated that it was a mistake in early Unix.
Apparently, Rob Pike had a Google+ post to this effect back in 2012 (or
earlier): I see a reference to it from another mailing list around that
time. Unfortunately, the Google+ content is now lost. Rob, do you have a
copy?

Who made the change and what was their motivation?

Speaking from memory, I think the intent was to avoid showing '.' and '..',
and that a programming error accidentally hid all dotfiles; probably this
went unnoticed because there just weren't many of them at the time. This
was corrected in 7th Edition, but the existing behavior had already escaped
into the world via Berkeley.

I suspect the "dot file" convention came later, as a side-effect of
observed behavior of ls.
