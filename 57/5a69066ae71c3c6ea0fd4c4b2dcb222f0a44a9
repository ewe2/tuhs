No... :-)

Yup. I found a pty.c in the NCP system, it's clearly the ancestor (comments
match):

    > I suspect BBN got it from the Bruce Borden's Rand distribution tape

Or possibly indirectly; my copy of the NCP came from NOSC via SRI. In addition
to the one above, there are also these:

  https://minnie.tuhs.org//cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=SRI-NOSC/dmr/misc/pty.c.ill
  https://minnie.tuhs.org//cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=SRI-NOSC/dmr/misc/pty.c.x

Here:

  https://minnie.tuhs.org//cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=BBN-V6/dmr/pty.c

is the BBN version, you can compare the them all. The MIT one is derived from
the BBN one.

Well, _RAND_ called them 'ports':

Somewhere I found a document about the UofI code, I think they wrote it from
scratch? Sorry, too lazy to look at it. See here:

for links.
