This SCO technical article explains in detail how to set up Micnet
networking on SCO Unix.

https://www.scosales.com/ta/kb/103649.htmlOB

Amusingly, the article says "The System Administrator's Guide for older
versions of SCO UNIX System V/386 contained a section on the Micnet network,
but this is not present in the SCO UNIX System V Release 3.2 Version 4.0
documentation. The documentation for this network is provided here.  Users
who wish to use this network system will require this documentation."

So it seems by the early 90's SCO was indeed phasing out the old Xenix
Micnet networking scheme.

Reading that article is interesting, and Micnet seems to have been a fragile
concoction. The article even says at the end: "You can only use mail to
transfer small files.  Large files are randomly truncated by mail." Not the
most reassuring thing to read about the computer system you are using...
