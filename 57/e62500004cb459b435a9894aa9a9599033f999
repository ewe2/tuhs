I've been asking this question around for a few years now.  My interest is in seeing the 10th Edition get released.
I've been told by sources in the Labs that there is no "9th Edition" in distribution format.  I'm only aware of the Labs'
archive copy and Norman Wilson's copies of 10th Edition still in existance...

Word is that Alcatel-Lucent and AT&T both don't care about it anymore.  I'm pretty sure it'd be up to Novell to add
8th, 9th, and 10th Edition UNIX to the "Ancient UNIX" license.  Might be a bit trickier getting SysIII and SysV on the
list, though.

I've been shooting e-mails to Novell's Intellectual Property office every few months for a while, but got no response.
It's probably time someone picked up the phone and attempted to navigate their menus.  We'd probably need the 
right person to call, though.  I've been meaning to set up a petition site to get a few signatures and see if we could
get Dennis Ritchie or someone to try to make a call.  Since this has come up again, I might give it a shot to see if
I can at least find a point of contact...

I don't believe so, as they were from the labs not USL. However,
Norman or Dennis would be able to clarify.

Cheers,
