I was at CRL from 1989 to 1994.  I sent an inquiry to our informal =
mailing list.

We had written an audio server along the lines of the X server =
(http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/CRL-93-8.pdf) and Tom =
Levergood wrote an application called Store24 to keep a rolling 24 =
history of WBUR (local NPR station).  We thought about using speech =
recognition to build a searchable index for it.

The next idea was to do the same thing for Video, perhaps using the =
closed captioning feed to develop the index.  Dave Wecker (now at =
Microsoft Research) reports working on extracting data from NPR news =
streams and it would find the appropriate audio or video clip.  He=E2=80=99=
s not sure he published that.

Jim Gettys cites =
http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/CRL-99-2.pdf (Indexing =
Multimedia for the Internet) and notes that all the DEC techreports are =
hidden away at http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/ =
<http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/>. Choose =E2=80=9CBrowse by year=E2=80=
