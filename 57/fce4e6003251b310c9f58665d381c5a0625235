Jon gets it, I'm not the only one.  I do the same thing with a big
invisble box, it gives you a mental place to place things.

Also agree with the "box that fits this text" problem, pic really could
use a sizeof("this text in the current font/point size/line spacing")
that returns x,y.  But I don't see how to do that because pic doesn't
have that info, pic would need to be able to ask troff what those are.

Oh, and I've written my own crappy version of grap(1) that spits out
pic, it was pretty easy.

So at least Jon sees pic like I do and I suspect there are plenty more
who do as well.  Spend some time writing some pic scripts and I suspect
anyone can get good at seeing what it is doing.  It's a super pleasant
little language.
