I have no memory of this, but that doesn't mean it's false.

Also in my defense, suggesting an option compared to actually adding
the code is a lesser crime. Or is it?

Anyway I removed all the options from research cat, including -u. That
counts for something.

 Handling pipes strikes me as a waste of code, but hey, anything is better =
than that version I replaced.
