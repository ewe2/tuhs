Github has this project: https://github.com/DoctorWkt/unix-jun72
with a June 1972 Unix kernel. Doing a "make", the generated build/unix is:

-rwxrwxrwx 1 wkt wkt 36432 Jan 21 10:10 build/unix

but I don't have a PDP-11 "size" command to give details.

http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dennis_v3/ has a Unix
system written in C, timestamped August 31, 1973 (just before Fourth Edition).
Inside nsys.tar.gz you will find:

-rw-r--r-- 0/0           26820 1973-09-24 03:41 u

which is the kernel image.

Unfortunately, we don't have a kernel from 1st Edition or 4th Edition.

Cheers, Warren
