Hi,

Found this in a box of papers... Scanned it in yesterday. Posting in
case it's of list interest:

https://docs.telegraphics.com.au/Microsoft_The%20Xenix%20Operating%20System_Abstract_January%204,%201982.tif

An OCR'd PDF version will eventually appear here:
http://chiclassiccomp.org/docs/index.php?dir=%2Fcomputing/Microsoft
(but it's not there yet).
