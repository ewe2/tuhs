U of M had the Teletype room which had teletypes (ASR 33's) with integral dataphones.     These got replaced with the LA36 decwriters most of which had APL character sets as well.   Upstairs was the Hazeltine room full of a half dozen Hazeltines that used ~ as the graphic escape (causing the HAZEL stty mode...leave poor tilde alone!) and one Tektronics storage scope monster.

My first C program was on one of JHU's teletypes complete with \( and \) for it being upper case only lacked the { } characters.
