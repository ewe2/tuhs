A couple more options occurred to me after I posted.

Maybe run tp in apout? Actually, V7 through 4.4BSD has a tp that is
written in C. Maybe see if you can get it to compile on a modern system.

Well, you could try to make one using rcp as a starting point.

Or send a shar to the terminal to be executed by an interactive shell.
(I make no claims about how well typical shar archivers work with the v6
shell and utilities; you might have to write one.)

AncientFS is read-only, but adding write capability might be an
interesting project.
