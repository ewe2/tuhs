Does anyone know what the fix is for this:

./ci_compile_expr.c: In function 'opcode_offset':
./ci_compile_expr.c:599:11: error: 'LONGLONG_FORM_OFFSET' undeclared (first use
in this function)
    return LONGLONG_FORM_OFFSET;

IIRC it used a separate graphics library built directly on top of x11 (or sunview) that provided variable scrolling etc. scrolling speed and direction depended on the distance you dragged the mouse pointer from its initial position. You could click on any source like and add a break or custom code in interpreted C. You could click on the data structure window and follow linked list structures etc. The last version was 3.38 in 2003. I don???t think it works with anything more modern than gcc3. The nicest debugger I ever used.
