I found out what the problem was.....(sheepishly
ducking...(:+\\...).  At 3 in the morning I had
a typeo in the config file that the old eyeballs
did not catch.  I had typed in the partitions
to allocate to root and swap, as opposed to just
the the disks.  It compiled fine, but when run,
it paniced and dumped itself all over the floor.
So much for myopic eyes programming at 3 in the
morning.....
