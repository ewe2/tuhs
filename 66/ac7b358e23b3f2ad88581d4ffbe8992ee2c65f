External names were limited to 7 (user-defined) characters because the compiler prepended the _ to them. Function names were always external in that era of C. Internal variables could be up to 8 characters. As for longer names, they were allowed but only the first 8 ( including the compiler supplied _ for external names) were signiicant.

I'll look for my documentation from v6.
