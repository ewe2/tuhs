The wecho_wchar(3ncurses) page[0] on my Debian box happens to mention
the following[1] in a discussion about incorporating Unicode support:

<quote>
    ·   The lantern is a special case.  It originated with  the  AT&T  4410
        terminal  in the early 1980s.  There is no accessible documentation
        depicting the lantern symbol on the AT&T terminal.

        Lacking documentation, most readers assume that a storm lantern was
        intended.  But there are several possibilities, all with problems.

        Unicode  6.0  (2010)  does provide two lantern symbols: U+1F383 and
        U+1F3EE.  Those were not available  in  2002,  and  are  irrelevant
        since  they  lie  outside the BMP and as a result are not generally
        available in terminals.  They are not storm lanterns, in any case.

        Most storm lanterns have a tapering glass chimney (to guard against
        tipping); some have a wire grid protecting the chimney.

        For  the  tapering  appearance, ☃ U+2603 was adequate.  In use on a
        terminal, no one can tell what the image represents.  Unicode calls
        it a snowman.

        Others  have suggested these alternatives: § U+00A7 (section mark),
        Θ U+0398 (theta), Φ U+03A6 (phi), δ U+03B4 (delta), ⌧ U+2327 (x  in
        a  rectangle), ╬ U+256C (forms double vertical and horizontal), and
        ☒ U+2612 (ballot box with x).

        $ dpkg -S $(man -aw wecho_wchar)
