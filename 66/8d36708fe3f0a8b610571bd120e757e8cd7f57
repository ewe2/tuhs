My favourite C /* */ style is this:

/*
 * foo
 * bar
 */

Is that what you meant?  And recent C also accepts // as a comment, which 
I use like this:

    /*
     * This is where we do some neat stuff.
     */
    foo();
    weird_function();	// Yes, we need to call this here...
    bar();

I'm quite taken by BIND, though, which accepts

/* this */
// this
# and this.
