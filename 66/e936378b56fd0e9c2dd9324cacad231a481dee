Yea. The oldest one we have is patch 195. which is good news!

I think so. There's 40 files that appear on a line starting with 'rm ' or
'Xrm ' (well maybe a few more if you count a non-functional lint removed,
no way to know for sure due to the '*').
10 of these files are either binaries, or are rendant man pages (meaning
the canonical copy is elsewhere and in a pinch we could have a very close
copy just omitting them entirely or copying from the canonical place). The
binaries can be regenerated. There's 3 files in pcc that can likely be
snagged from 2.10.1. There's 8 files named 'shortnames.h' that can be had
from 2.10.1 as well. There's 2 files that were created and then later
deleted. There's one non-existent file that was deleted. there's 10
toolchain related files that we can get from 2.10.1 and/or the CSRG SCCS
tree (haven't checked to see if the PDP-11 versions are there, they aren't
in the easily browsable svn conversion). The entire source for ar, nm and
ld are removed, but I think that 2.10.1 are the same, and/or CSRG repo
fallback. That leaves nsys.c as the only file not existing in 2.10.1, which
makes sense... it implements the new system call convention in 2.11, and it
too may be in the SCCS tree...

So based on that, I think it's worth giving it a try... :) Comments?

Warner
