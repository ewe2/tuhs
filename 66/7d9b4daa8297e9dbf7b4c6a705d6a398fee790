> Reaching outside of UNIX, RSX/11 used external supervisor-mode =
processes called ACPs (ancillary control processes) to implement file =
systems. I don't know exactly how they were plugged in, but I do know =
they were pluggable, so their interface must have constituted a =
file-system switch of some sort. RSX dates back into the 1970s. At some =
point in the latter part of the 1980s, Ralph Stamerjohn (a name =
instantly recognizable in the 16-bit DEC software world) gave a DECUS =
talk about implementing a remote file system through ACPs: a stub ACP on =
the client exporting RPCs over the network, a real one at the server =
end. I remember chatting with him about how that did and didn't resemble =
the way pjw had done it; interesting architectural comparison.

I am still digesting all the inputs (thanks, all!)

The above post made me realise that the delineation of what is a FSS/VFS =
or not, is not so easy.

I did a little bit of reading, and the concept of an ACP arrived with =
RSX11D in May 1973, but only matured in RSX11M in November 1974. As I =
understand it, originally in RSX11 file system code was closely tied to =
the low-level device driver for each device. ACP=E2=80=99s separated the =
file system code from the device driver itself, and became separate =
processes.

In essence there were two switches: one switch into abstract devices, =
implemented in ACP code and one kernel switch to deal with hardware =
interfacing. The first is indeed like a file system switch (although =
still tied to specific devices).

Looking at this stuff made me realise that my retro machine of choice =
(the TI990) went through a similar evolution. In the early seventies it =
had a sort of abstract device switch that linked to individual =E2=80=98de=
vice service routines=E2=80=99 (drivers). Initially, these modelled =
batch oriented =E2=80=98logical units=E2=80=99 that tied to files at the =
job control level. Later (late 70=E2=80=99s), the =E2=80=98open=E2=80=99 =
command would carry a file name and the file system was delegated to the =
device service routine. Still later (say 1983) this was used for =
networked disks.

As several people have observed in this topic, indeed there appears to =
be a close relationship between a device switch and a file system =
switch.
