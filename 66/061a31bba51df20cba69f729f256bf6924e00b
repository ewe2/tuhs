Dunno.   The first I dealt with was the f77 based on the pcc backend.

I was not clear, evidently, although part of this is my memory's fault :-)

 

There was a fortran compiler on v6, written in assembly. I was wondering who wrote it.

Funny but: I once had a compile fail on Motorola's MPL compiler, which was written in fortran. It had so many continued comment lines that the 16-bit column number went negative, and I got a fairly obscure error. 

 

Anyone remember who wrote it?
