Still there in FORTRAN 77.

Still there in FORTRAN 77.

The compiler recognize "GOTO I". And I have to be assigned to a 
statement number (label). It has to be an integer variable, and when you 
assign it to a label, you cannot do any arithmetic with it anymore. And 
you assign it with a special statement. Thus, it can be used to store 
what label to jump to, but you cannot use arithmetic to set what it 
should jump to.

It's actually not that hard. All this stuff is fairly simple to deal 
with. The real horror in FORTRAN is EQUIVALENCE, which can give C a fair 
fight for real horror stories.

But of course, bad programmers can mess things up beyond belief in any 
language.

(And I never went beyond FORTRAN 77, so I don't know how current 
versions look like. I stayed with PDP-11s (well, still do), and nothing 
newer than FORTRAN 77 exists there. :-) )
