I had a bizarre side project to re-host old GCC 1.x on Windows so I could cross compile early Linux kernels (it actually works too!)

I was going down the path of cross compiling 386BSD when I ran into the boot block hell of it being really inconvenient to stage any kernel in a way to boot test.

Anyway PCC is more or less alive these days, and supports both i386 and AMDx64.  I'd suppose cross compiling from that may be doable.  I'd shoved Tahoe through GCC 1.42 for the i386, and most of the C actually built.  Of course no assembly, no boot/stand and I gave up just as quickly as the low stuff is well over my head.  But my point being that it ought to be something that could be done, there was even that Quasijarous VAX which was Tahoe with POSIX removed.....
