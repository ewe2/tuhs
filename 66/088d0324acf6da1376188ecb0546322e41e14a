It was used in academia although it did appear elsewhere for instance in
some PLC applications, for a long while some supertankers were running
PS/2s with Optio22 I/O boards to control pumps and whatnot.

I have seen the media kits in person recently.  They comically come with an
=E2=80=9Caction=E2=80=9D key cap for your Model M.  I have a picture of int=

I don=E2=80=99t think the lack of popularity was any conspiracy.  SCO had m=
