This thread brings to mind a wonderful saying which I just saw in another forum:

"A wise man speaks when he feels he has something to say - a fool speaks when
he feels he has to say something."

And to reply in advance to the 'but I did't realize so many other people had
sent in replies' - try scanning your emailbox before replying to messages to a
large list.

S/N is to be hallowed.
