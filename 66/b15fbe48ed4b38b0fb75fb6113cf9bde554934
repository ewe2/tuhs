I think the key reason is that the shell does not build an AST from
the command you type, instead executing the phrases it encounters as it
sees them.  So when the shell sees ">file", it opens "file" for writing
in preparation of the rest of the command.  If no command comes, the
line is handled the same way as an empty one and the redirections are
discarded.  The shell could print an error here, but avoiding the side
effect of opening "file" for lines just consisting of redirects would be
difficult.  But then, why should it print an error?  The behaviour is
not harmful after all and I'd say that nobody really thought about this
being a thing when the shell was originally written.

Yours,
