Huh, I'm not sure about the Sun 3/50 ethernet being faster than disk.  It
is possible because diskless 3/50's worked fairly well.  The similar
era Apollos were miserable without disk, I wanted nothing to do with
them but I was fine on a 3/50.  Not great but it worked.  They worked
better with 8MB of ram, 4 was tight.
