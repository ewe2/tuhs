Yes. And if there are binaries, like for 4.4BSD-Lite, they are on 
the ISO file system, not in tar archives. So many file system attributes
like links are lost, device nodes are plain files, ... 
I made 4.4BSD-Lite working on my HP9000 433t, but it was a bit
complicated, required a netbooted NetBSD, problems with disklabel
differences 4.4BSD <=> NetBSD, ... It works now (more or less) 
and when I have the time I work on a build to update the machine
to the final 4.4BSD-Lite2. 
e.g. 4.3BSD-Reno binaries for HP9000 300 would be fine. VAX binaries 
are already in the archive. With that you can put a VAX and a HP300 
side by side and see and feel the the difference from architecture
to architecture. The same for 4.4BSD on HP300, SPARC, PMAX, ...
Or some 4.[012]BSD on a VAX 11/7[35]0. Are you willing to rebuild
the world on a 0.3 / 0.6 VUP machine with <= 2MB RAM?
