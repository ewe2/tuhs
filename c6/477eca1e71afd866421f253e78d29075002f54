I'm curious whether the same thing happens if you try that in some
other shell? (Not sure how widely here documents were supported back
then, but I'm asking anyway.)

The PC value in the panic report ("pc 161324") strikes me as high, but
161324 octal is 58068 decimal, so it's not excessively so, and perhaps
in line with what one might expect to see with a kernel pinned near
top of memory. Are the offsets in the backtrace constant, i.e. does it
always crash on the same code?

Not knowing what cpuerr 20 is specifically doesn't help, and at least
http://www.retro11.de/ouxr/29bsd/usr/src/sys/sys/trap.c.html#n:112
(which doesn't seem to be too far from what you are running) isn't
terribly enlightening; CPUERR is simply a pointer into a memory-mapped
register of some kind, as seen at
http://www.retro11.de/ouxr/29bsd/usr/include/sys/iopage.h.html#m:CPUERR,
and at least pdp11_cpumod.c from the simh source code at
http://simh.trailing-edge.com/interim/pdp11_cpumod.c wasn't terribly
enlightening, though of course I could be looking in entirely the
wrong place.
