Precisely, but idiots keep repeating those "quotes" (if they were repeated 
accurately at all) in some sort of an effort to make the so-called 
"experts" look silly; a form of reverse jealousy/snobbery or something? 
It really pisses me off, and I'm sure that there's a medical term for 
it...

I came across a web site that had these populist quotes, alongside the 
original *taken in context*, but I'm damned if I can find it now.

I mean, how many people could afford a 7094, FFS?  The power bill, the air 
conditioning, the team of technicians, the warehouse of spare parts...

Hell, I'll bet that my iPhone has more power than our System-360/50, but 
it has nowhere near the sheer I/O throughput of a mainframe :-)
