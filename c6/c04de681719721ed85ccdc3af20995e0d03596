Yup. There are lots of issues here. The story made it to /. 
http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/02/16/2322243&mode=thread&tid=99
and things like media longevity, data formats, and future
availability came up in the comments section. I believe we need to
somehow provide the future with the benefit of our intelligence and
experience as well as with information. And TUHS can be of help
there. Besides, a great deal of Unix history (not all of it be any
means) was created in the US: Bell Labs, Digital, Sun, IBM, SCO,
Xenix, etc. So there is clearly a US 'interest'. I guess the
question may be whether the Library is going to archive systems or
restrict itself to content, ie web pages.
