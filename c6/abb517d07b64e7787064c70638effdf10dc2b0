Subject: [TUHS] Fwd: Helping in the battle against SCO
Message-ID: <3F5F8707.7070504@aclaro.com>

What about comparing SVR1/2 to 2.4.x?  SCO seems to be picking on the 
early 2.4.x codebase.  This should also pick up the SGI code comments in 
the malloc() function that were recently publicized, though I'm not sure 
which version Linus removed the code from.

Matt.
