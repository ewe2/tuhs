Not so sure about that; we had that C at MIT, but only regular troff (which
had been hacked to drive a Varian).

No, typesetter C definitely pre-dated V7. The 'PWB1' system at MIT had the new
C.

Looking at the documentation files for the extension (e.g. addition of
'long's), none of them have dates in them (alas), but my hard-copy printout of
one is dated "May 8 1978", and it was several years old at that point.

(Also, several sources give '79 for V7 - Salus says 'June 1979').
