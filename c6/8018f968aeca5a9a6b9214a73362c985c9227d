Helios: a Unix-like system running on Transputers (and TI C40, and a few others).

It had a similar notion of a universal protocol for servers to hook into the "file" namespace as Plan9 / 9P, and a shell that included operators for spawning tasks on other CPUs, parallel execution, and so on.

They'd ported some basic GNU userland: GCC, GMake, etc, as well as the basic sources (ls, and co -- not sure where they came from or if they were written from scratch).  There was even an X11R5 (maybe R4?) server that would work with a few of the framebuffers that some of the Transputer boards had.

All good fun.  Sadly didn't last too long: likely killed off by Inmos' late delivery of the second gen T9000 processor like most of the Transputer world, but they disappeared after trying to move onto other CPUs seemingly unsuccessfully.
