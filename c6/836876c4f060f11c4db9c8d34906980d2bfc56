RT-11 does support magtape installation via a special version of DUP
called MDUP.  If you look on a full RT-11 V5.x distribution, you will
find "MDUP.MT", "MDUP.MS", and (depending on version number) "MDUP.AI"
and "MDUP.MU".  These are "snapshots" of RT-11 systems with a single
tape driver (MT, MS, or MU) and a number of different disk drivers
installed (so they don't have to be FETCHed) and running the special
install-only build of DUP.

I think there is some MDUP info in the doc set, though it is
heavily oriented (of course) towards magtape installtion, not
serial port installation.  But the idea is sound.

Yes, this works, and is even officially supported in the later 5.x
releases (where it is used as part of the AI installation procedure.)
