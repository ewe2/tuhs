Not "intentionally" as "let me slow this down" but as in "it's faster 
and cheaper to make a slower cpu so I'll just give you more of them".

The market has shown, repeatedly, that more slow cpus are not as fun
as less faster cpus.  

It's not a hard concept and I struggle to understand why it's a point
to discuss.

Yeah, so what?  That wasn't the point being discussed though you and Perry
keep pushing it.
