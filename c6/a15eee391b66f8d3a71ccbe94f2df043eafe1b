Neat!  Do you think we will ever be able to recover those bits or is it too
obscure and unobtanium like the rs6000 Mach port?

As an aside I=E2=80=99ve near complete technical references for both of the=
se
platforms (RT, rs6000) and they were quite comprehensive for doing OS
ports. I wondered why there was no free open source OS for them but I now
suspect people just had fear of IBM, some real and some imagined.
