The 3B4000 had a 3B20 inside that acted as the bootstrap controller (ala the micro-pdp inside the larger Vaxen doing similar duty).  Most impressively, said 3B20, with the CPU and IO power of a match stick, was also the Ethernet portal for the entire 3B4000.  It couldn't even come close to keeping up with its 10 mbit/s NIC.

AT&T flogged this abomination to us as the core of our "distributed network environment."  Actually, they flogged it to us as a "1 million dollar donation in kind" because they knew nobody would buy that piece of shit, but this way they got the tax write off, and our beloved University president got to grin madly at a press conference.

When they replaced it with a half-dozen 3B2-xxx servers (about a year later) we at least got a marginal improvement in network throughput.  But they cancelled that out with RFS.

Basically, the 3B2s (and the 3B4K by extension) were designed to hang off the side of the 4ESS and collect toll call records for billing purposes.  Anyone remember Tuxedo?

I don't think we ever landed one of those in the shop.  It seemed like an intriguing bit of gear back when I looked at it.  Decades ago, now.
