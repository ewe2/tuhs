I think I've heard of people doing nolisting before and ran across the 
term within the last week.

I wonder how effective it is.

I recently wrote a gray mail server (in Perl) that ran into the problem 
of the 3rd bullet point in Drawbacks.  -  My workaround has been to 
return ICMP errors, much like nolisting probably does.

I will have to give Nolisting more thought and mess with it.
