I did some searching and the previous answer is correct.   Neither V6 or PWB 1 have any of the str functions.    V7 and 32V both have them (including strncpy).
I was wrong in my conjecture it came over with the portable (later to be std) io library.   It seems to have happened in the revamping of libc into seperate subdirectories.
