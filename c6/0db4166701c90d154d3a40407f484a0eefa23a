Well, me, I'd just use 'od' - but then again, I have ucode for disassembling
PDP-11 octal! :-) (OK, OK, so a lot of the less common instructions I have
to look up! :-)

But, seriously, yeah, 'db' is probably the way to go.

FWIW, it's possible to get 'adb' running under V6 without much (any?) work,
too. Although maybe it needs the 'phototypesetter' C compiler? I'd have to
check...

There's also a 'cdb' running around (I found a copy on the 'Shoppa disks'),
which is basically 'db' but augmented with a few useful commands - maybe stack
backtrace, I don't recall the details, the documentation in on my V6, and I
don't feel like spinning it up just to look for that.
