Hijacking this a bit but much props to Tom, he has done so much.  I 
learned he exposed the IOMMU to user space in Linux, you have to be
a geek to get how cool that is, it's life changing for VMs and Tom
just sort of said yeah, I did that, like it was not a big deal.

So I hosted Tom and a bunch of other systems guys at my place, we did
a rib fest and talked about systems.  It's the most fun I've had in
years, Kirk and Eric came and spent the night in my guest house and
Kirk dryly said "could we do this more often than every 20 years" 
because I used to go to their house for wine tastings.  But it had
been at least 20 years.

Kevin Bowling was the energy that got that meeting going and he has
asked me if there was some way to get an East Coast version of that
going.  He really wants the DEC people, he has a theory that if we
could get the PDP-11 people and the VAX people there would be so many
good stories.

Would there be any interest in getting the DEC people together and 
getting them to tell stories?  I hate to travel but I'd travel for
that, especially if we got bwk and other Bell Labs people like 
Doug to show up.

Pugs, happy to see you here, this list is fun.
