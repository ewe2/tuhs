Betreff: [TUHS] The first PDP-7 running Unix

> In honor of the Unix 50 party tomorrow, I wrote an analysis of the
> available data to conclude the first PDP-7 that Ken and Dennis used to
> bring up Unix on was serial number 34. I've not seen this result elsewhere,
>
> but if it's common place, please let me know.
>
> https://bsdimp.blogspot.com/2019/07/the-pdp-7-where-unix-began.html
>
> One surprise from the analysis: there was only one pdp-7 in the world that
>
> could have run the original v0 unix. It's the only one that had the RB09
>
> hard drive (though the asset list referenced in the article listed a RC09
>
> on that system).
