Warren There are a number of usenix tapes missing in your archives.   The fi=
rst three were called 1 2 and 3 from the mid 70s but where included in the H=
arvard tape*** from about 76 or 77 which I sort of consider the first usenix=
 tape.  Note that This is an stp format distribution.     Which IIRC the v6 t=
p could read or at least read it enough to pull the stp binary off the tape w=
hich would then allow you read the whole thing.      You will need the v6 ar=
 because the directories inside the tape were archived as files called cont.=
a   And I think I remember that some of those were compressed with pack/unpa=
ck tools which were in the wild in those days =E2=80=94 probably also on the=
 Harvard tape.    As I mentioned the other day the 1BSD tape you have seems t=
o be a conversion from stp to tar.  =20

FYI:  one of the issues with tp and stp is that the directory for the tape i=
s at the beginning of the tape itself and is fixed in size [this is have DEC=
tape worked].  Because it was fixed in size folks archived directories toget=
her so the tp directory needed only the folder and a single file it.   FWIW O=
ne of the big enhancements tar provided over tp was the threading the direct=
ory throughout the archive which eliminated tat issue, but of course if ther=
e is a tape error recovery is more difficult.  IIRC Harvard had added a seco=
nd directory to the end of tp in the stp format to help reliability.  Ie if y=
ou had errors in the tp directory at the front of the tape, you had a chance=
 to recover by using the second copy of it.  =20


*** the Harvard tape takes it name from the meeting at Harvard of the Unix N=
ews readers.  This would become USENIX as an org shortly there after.   The e=
arlier tapes (1 2 and 3) were what files had been collected at earlier meeti=
ngs.=20

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.=
