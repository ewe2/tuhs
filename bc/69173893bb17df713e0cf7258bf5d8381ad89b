=E2=80=A6 and after Mary Ann was done with it (sometime 1981?), =
Professor Fabry gave the UCB Onyx to a bunch of undergraduates which =
they used as the first computer of the Undergraduate Computing Facility =
(UCF, predecessor to the UCB XCF which had a pile of Suns to play with) =
in room B50 (basement) of Evans Hall. I was one of those undergrads.

That machine became the =E2=80=9Cx=E2=80=9D host on the UCB BerkNet, and =
it was where B version netnews software was written by Matt Glickman (he =
was a high school student at the time and while he had Mary Ann=E2=80=99s =
patronage, my memory is that none of the more official computer services =
in CS or the Computer Center would give him an account - but we did). At =
the time, every other computer had restrictions on who could use =E2=80=98=
em, or that you had to pay hefty fees for use (the computer center =
PDP-11/70s were in that class) - our policy was: if you have a current =
UCB student ID, we=E2=80=99ll give you an account. We didn=E2=80=99t =
care whether you were a CS or Engineering student, or not.

I remember fixing bugs in various bits of BSD stuff we added to the =
userland and kernel - we had full source to play with, which was nice. =
Adding job control was a top priority, and one of our hacks was to =
change the tty line discipline to restore previous =E2=80=9Ccooked=E2=80=9D=
 character processing state if the program in foreground which had last =
changed it exited non-zero - that way, programs that modified tty state =
didn=E2=80=99t need to be recoded for job control too, which, in a =
system with PDP-11-like memory restrictions (64k text, 64k data maximum =
per process), was useful.

We trained an awful lot of students in the ways of Unix, and many of =
them became system administrators of the explosion of Unix systems which =
came to UCB later: the workstation clusters, other microcomputer based =
Unixes, etc. Kernel hackers (systems programmers) too.

Mary Ann also allowed me to photocopy a samizdat copy of the Lions Book, =
too. I still have that =E2=80=A6 somewhere, though I bought a copy of =
the Peter Salus 1996 republication, too.
