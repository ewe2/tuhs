It is not about wages, when I was a grad student I got $16K and had to 
pay tuition and rent and everything else out of that.

It's not about money.  It's about caring about your craft.  I cared,
the people I have worked with in industry cared, if they didn't I
left.

The point I was trying to make was that you can be a student and still
be a pro.  Or not.  The pros care about their craft.  The Mach people,
in my you-get-what-you-paid-for opinion, were not pros.  They got a
lot done in a sloppy way and they left a mess.

I don't know how to say it more clearly, there are plenty examples of
students that wrote clean code.  Mach was cool, clean code it was not.
