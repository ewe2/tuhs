On a historical note, I am curious if anyone on the list remembers much 
about the development of the first spell checkers in Unix? Good 'ol 
remarkably accurate wikipedia suggests that it is descended from SAIL's 
DEC PDP-10 version. Who wrote the first standalone tool for unix and did 
they, as the wikip article says, base it on the DEC PDP-10 version 
(surely it would have been c, not assembly)? I see the man page for it 
in v6, but no executable. Just curious.
