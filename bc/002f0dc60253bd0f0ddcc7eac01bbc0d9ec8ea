I'm sure. I've the man-page for lkdata() and unlk()

       #include <sys/lockblk.h>

       long lkdata (fildes, flag, lkblk);
       int fildes, flag;
       struct lockblk *lkblk;

       long unlk (fildes, flag, lkblk);
       int fildes, flag;
       struct lockblk *lkblk;

in the eastern germany english was not teached (or very rarely) so many
things - even in the world of the computers - where kept in german - so
did the man pages.

I can post the man-page link but your german isn't probably that good ;)
