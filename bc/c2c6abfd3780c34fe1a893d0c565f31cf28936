We may not need mount afterall.  The init process mounts /dev/rk0 on
/usr during startup (after the second "1:" label on e12-01).

Btw, how does one manipulate the consoel switches in simh?  The
init process goes into single user mode (top of init on e12-01)
if the console switches are set appropriately..  I've stepped through
this code to verify that it is not doing that with our config
(if it was, it should go straight to shell with no login prompt).
