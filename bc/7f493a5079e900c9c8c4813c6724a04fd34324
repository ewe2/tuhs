Note that the reflecting layer in factory produced CDs is aluminium.
A thin layer of lacquer is protecting the reflector.

As an interesting eye opening experiment I dumped one of these AOL promo CDs
we used to be bombarded with in a bowl of lukewarm water.  Plain water, 25
degrC. Within a day the aluminium layer had holes in it the size of dimes.
Apparantly the protective lacquer was very substandard.

El-cheapo CDR can have similar characteristics.
