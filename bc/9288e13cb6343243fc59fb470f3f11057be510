Remember Eedie & Eddie, Peter Langston’s DecTalk voice synthesizers who would answer the phone with “Yes, operator, I will accept the charges!” and then responded to touch tone commands to perform algorithmic compositions and sing songs together to you over the telephone?

Good thing Bellcore had all the free long distance phone service they could use, because anyone who knew the phone number for Eedie & Eddie could use it to make as many free third party charge long distance phone calls as they desired! 

(Spoiler: The phone number was listed in the title of Peter S. Langston’s 1986  Summer USENIX paper!)

Another way to parboil your brain with it was to set the "update interval" to 5 seconds (a.k.a. a "flash" game) and have a several hour (instead of the more typical several month) gaming session with like-minded crazies ... I mean, "players" ... in a terminal room.
