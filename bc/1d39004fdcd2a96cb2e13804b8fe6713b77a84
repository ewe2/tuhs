There are lots of RPC protocols that run over TCP which is for the
most part an unstructured byte stream, so there's no reason why RPC
couldn't be run over a local file transport in a similar way
(especially with one that preserves message boundaries, unlike TCP,
which requires application-layer protocols to implement their own
framing).
