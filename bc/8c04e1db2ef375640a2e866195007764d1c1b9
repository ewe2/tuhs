About old sun software.
I work for Sun PS as regional manager and I have secured a stunningly 
large cardboard box with Sun software.
It is all on tape and there is a bundle of it.
If you guys can sort out the legal thing I could go through the box and 
send you all the non duplicate things.
Would that be fun?
