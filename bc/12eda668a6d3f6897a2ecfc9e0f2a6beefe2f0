Unless I have utterly forgotten, EMT was to be used by DEC and TRAP
by users.  Since Bell Labs was a user, they used TRAP (I asked ken --
I think it was ken, definitely not Ken -- about this).  Of course,
DEC didn't anticipate that any user would write an operating system!

On RSTS/E as opposed to RSTS, both EMT and TRAP went to the user
executive.  To reach the kernel, you did EMT 377 followed by another
EMT, but EMT 377; EMT 377 was vectored back to the user as an EMT 377.
That's what allowed RSTS/E to host other OSes that used EMT.
