ls(1) in Plan9 reports everything. There are no 'hidden' files according to the traditional UNIX meaning. The convention for config files is to place them under $home/lib. But there are so few of these it's not really an issue.  Most users get away with lib/profile and lib/plumbing and don't require anything else.
