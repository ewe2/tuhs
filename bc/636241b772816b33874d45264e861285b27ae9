I count "derived" as meaning that I can trace a continuous code lineage from one
to the other. So V7 -> 32V -> 3BSD -> 4.xBSD -> 4.4BSD-Lite -> Open Src BSDs.

But Linux isn't derived, in this sense.

I'm following the official trademark. I must admit that I dithered in each
direction, but then decided to stick to the official, blessed version of
the typography.

Glad you guys liked the paper.
