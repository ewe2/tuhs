I think we can lay a lot of the blame for that major annoyance on the two related facts:
a: there is no universal windowing system everybody adheres to, just two major commercial ones with 
spin-offs for smartphones and the like;
b: a lot of Linux developers are chasing MS Windows in hope of desktop market share and copy MS 
Windows features and misfeatures.

A major irony is that MS Windows itself has chased Linux somewhat on the graphical user interface 
front - Linux was the platform of GUI redesign for OLPC and Android, Microsoft took the bait and tried 
it as a desktop in MS Win 8.0 and got slammed for it.

Setting out standards for a herd of cats is not much of an option; the best one could do is publish RFCs 
giving a list of features that have been proven to work in practice and hope for the best.
