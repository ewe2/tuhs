There exists in one of our listmembers archives the last
running V10 UNIX for VAX on I believe MVII or MVIII class
machines.  The availability of it remains a bit in limbo.
But, it would be nice to have that available in the public
archives, if I could make the suggestion.  I would be of
the opinion, also, that it would be nice to have them in
the publicly available arena for educational, hobby, or
whatever the current nomenclature is, use.  Perhaps
if that person is listening, the subject might be approachable
to whomever controls the legalese mumbo-jumbo.  It is a
long-shot, but ya never know if ya don't ask.....(:+}}...
