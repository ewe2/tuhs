Interesting; similar, though not identical to some material I captured back
in the 1990s on TOPS-10 FILDAE in a discussion about Linux filesystem
permission semantics...

It seemed interesting, so I added it to a web page:
linuxfinances.info/info/fs.html

The claim is that there would be a fildae control file like the following:
# anything in a directory named "private" is off limits
*/private/*:*:*:*:
# people in group "foo" get full (create, delete, read, write,
# execute) access to everything in the foo project directory
~/projects/foo/*:*:foo:*:cdrwx
# people playing mygame can update the high score file
~/mygame/score.dat:*:*:
~/mygame/bin/mygame:rw
# some friends have access to the RCS files for mygame
~/mygame/src/RCS/*:dennis,kevin,josh:*:
/usr/bin/ci:rw
~/mygame/src/RCS/*:dennis,kevin,josh:*:
/usr/bin/co:rw
# I'll put stuff I want everyone to read in my ~/public directory
# I'll make the public directory 744, so no one will actually have
# to check .access_list, but I'll still put in this entry for
completeness
~/public/*:*:*:*:r# anything left over gets no access*:*:*:*:
--=20
When confronted by a difficult problem, solve it by reducing it to the
question, "How would the Lone Ranger handle this?"
