fred was certainly a character.

perhaps ken or rob might confirm this, but i recall at least one of the =
canoe trips demonstrated
the effects of dropping flour sacks onto canoes from a small airplane. =
(i was not present on any
of these trips, but heard this from grampp.)

he was also responsible for occasionally buying bulk bags of barely =
digestible cheese crackers
(we called them cheese awfuls) and leaving them in the Unix Room to be =
eaten.
