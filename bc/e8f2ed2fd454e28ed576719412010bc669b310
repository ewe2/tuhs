I'm puzzled about the "minus YP/NIS". I negotiated the IBM NFS license 
on behalf of AIX, but was inclusive of the rest of the company, so I 
think ACIS put NFS into AOS under the auspices of that license. I 
remember discussing with the Palo Alto ACIS folks at the time.

I only had AOS at home, without Ethernet, so wouldn't have tried to use 
NFS or YP. But I would have thought that ACIS would have included YP.
