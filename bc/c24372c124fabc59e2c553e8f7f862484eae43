:-)

In 1985 for a client I had to check if Sendmail's
implementation of SMTP met FIPS standard or some such (don't
ask -- I don't recall most of the details now). I got pretty
familiar with it.  But ever since then I have not wanted to
use it. I switched to PostFix a long time ago but that too has
become rather complicated.
