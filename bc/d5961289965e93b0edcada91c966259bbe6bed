To bring the topic back to some relevance to SIMH:=20

Does it _matter_ that we=E2=80=99ve ended up with a handful of Linux variant=
s (RH, Ubuntu, etc, plus Android) and BSD derivatives (macOS, iOS, etc) domi=
nating the Unix world?

If xBSD has some great idea, it=E2=80=99ll get wedged into Linux (one can ar=
gue about the elegance of course) and the Apple *OS as soon as it proves ben=
eficial to enough users.  If one out-performs the other, you can bet someone=
 will track it down and fix it.=20

Even Windows is adopting Unix/Linux concepts now.

If the kernel.org tree is both the source of many distro variants and the si=
nk for many successful ideas, I can only hope OpenSIMH has similar success.=20=


Vive la diff=C3=A9rence!
