Before people devote too much effort to flogging a dead horse, I,
too, have recently tried to build a gcc cross-compiler for the
PDP-11 with no success.  I have not seen a version that worked
since GCC 2.something.  It is possible that changes to GCC have
broken the PDP-11 code and that no one is keeping it up.  I would
love to hear otherwise if anyone has successfully built a pdp-11
cross compiler using anything vaguely current.
