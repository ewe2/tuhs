I'd like 'gatech' if nobody got it.  I was ...!{gatech,emory}!skeeve!arnold
until ~ 1997 when I moved to Israel. I was also arnold at skeeve.atl.ga.us
with Emory acting as my MX and mail forwarder. I ran 'smail' for many
years, I might even have the source around somewhere.

Thanks,

Arnold

P.S. At the very least, it'd be fun to come back up as plain 'skeeve'.
