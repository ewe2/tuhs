I wouldn't call it an error, merely a misleading sentence. .EX/.EE is,
after all, an extension in Gnu, albeit not original to Gnu. And I
didn't intend to impugn anybody. The sentence, "Ingo Schwarze stated 
incorrectly" was apparently slipped into the quotation to provide 
missing context. I do appreciate, however, how quickly the 
inexactness was repaired.
