I have that paper (=E2=80=9CThe Unix 8th Edition Network File =
System=E2=80=9D), it was presented at a March 1985 ACM conference. =
However, there are indications that the roots of the file system switch =
existed earlier, possibly much earlier.

I think Doug McIlroy once described 1973 as a pivotal year for Unix, =
with many concepts devised that would blossom in the following 3-5 =
years. I=E2=80=99m increasingly tempted to think that Summer =E2=80=9981 =
- Summer =E2=80=9982 was a similarly pivotal year.

That is a good idea. If someone has the email address I=E2=80=99d =
appreciate an off list message.
