It was certainly that way with 386BSD.  Jolitz released 0.0, and a lot
of us made improvements.  Then he released 0.1, with none of our
improvements at all in it.  We pulled up all our fixes, and made more.
Then he released 0.2, still with nothing from the net included.  That's
when NetBSD was born.  (FreeBSD forked off later, due to disagreements
over whether to concentrate on Intel processors (the FreeBSD crowd), or
stick to the multi-platform approach (NetBSD).)
