There is an email header in the file. If you edit it and remove everything before the %!PS-Adobe-2.0 preamble, it will load with gs and converts perfectly to pdf with ps2pdf.

Unfortunately Ghostscript can't convert that .ps file to a PDF.

He might have started with make for ksh83 and 86, but switched to Fowler's 
nmake and then shipped that /bin/sh script in ksh88 for people (everyone, 
basically) who didn't have nmake.

Changing that was one of the controversial modifications made to ksh93 in 
ksh-2020. It's pretty complex. 

Here's a paper that describes part of it:
