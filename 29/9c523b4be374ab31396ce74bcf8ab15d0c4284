I don't think that I agree with this.  I recall that there was a "public terminal
room" on maybe the 4th floor of building 2 that was filled with random terminals
of all types hooked to modems.  It's where I first came across glass ttys.  I know
that many of the UNIX machines had modems; I would borrow a Silent 700 or Execuport
so that I could work from home which annoyed my parents since I would tie up the
phone.  So while I don't recall doing so one could dial one up from one of the glass
ttys in the public terminal room.
