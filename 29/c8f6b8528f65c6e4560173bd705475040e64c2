I expect it would.  It's not hard to write a formatter program.  I wrote
one for my Acorn Archimedes, and an RX50 copier program as well.

I seem to recall that DEC let people copy XXDP between machines without too
much excitement.

So long as they're labelled SD or DD and not HD, they have the right
coercivity.  Some people argue that the fineness of the emulsion may be a
factor, but actually you'd have to be incredibly unlucky to have a flaw on
a disk that would allow it to be perfect for SD but not DD.  Some people
have likewise argued that the disk head gap is only about half as wide for
80-track as it is for 40-track, but that's irrelevant: even if the gap is a
third of the track pitch, thats around 1/300", the resulting bit density
(300 bpi) on the radius of the disk is still much coarser than the bit
density around the circumference (about 3300 bpi for single density).

I do have a few very old S/S floppies with flaws on the second side, and
which therefore aren't good to use as D/S (I value my data!) but I have
hundreds more sold as S/S that are work fine as D/S.  They just weren't
certified that way; they probably just weren't tested, in the days when
lots of disks didn't need to be.
