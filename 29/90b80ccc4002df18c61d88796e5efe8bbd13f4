Subject: [TUHS] Has dmr's home page moved?
Message-ID: <20110726225330.GA15845@minnie.tuhs.org>

I went to Dennis' home page this morning to find something, and it seems
to be gone. The URL I'm using is http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/

Does anybody know if it's moved or, if not, who to contact to fix it?
I'm actually after the hi-res version of the photo with dmr and ken
at the PDP-11/20 console. I think I have a copy cached away. If not, does
anybody else have a copy?

Cheers,
	Warren
