I think it is a problem, or better a gap, a void, with the current
standard that software has no option to become informed of the
event of a leap second for one, but further more that CLOCK_TAI is
not available.  I think it would make things easier if software
which wants just that can get it, e.g., for periodic timer events
etc.  This is surely not a healing given that most timestamps etc.
are based on UTC, but i think the severity of the problems could
possibly be lowered.  Especially now that multi-hour smears seem
to become used by big companies it seems to be important to have
a correct clock available.  This is in fact something i don't
really understand, at _that_ level that is to say.  If, e.g.,
Google and Bloomberg both would have stated instead that they
slew the leap second, then only a single second would have been
affected, instead of multiple hours.
