	Yes, it does.   A bug in the parsing.   Why it does not affect all
	the lines is unknown.   Perhaps some trailing whitespace caused the
	parser to exhibit the bug.

	What is the exact message?   I did a "strings /unix" and could not
	not find a string that looked mentioned unknown or interrupt.

	That would seem to indicate that the device is interrupting but not
	at the expected vector.

	It is possible to use 'adb' to look at the contents of the vectors.

	adb -k /unix /dev/kmem
	0344/o

	will show the contents of the 0344 vector.  The value there should
	be equal to 'cnrint' (or cnxint - I forget which comes first).

	Definitely worth trying.

	Ah, ok.  Thanks for the correction.   I misread the initial mail item.

	:)  

	I did the the same thing - wondered why I could never get a clean
	file system.   Then I realized what was going on.

	Cheers,
