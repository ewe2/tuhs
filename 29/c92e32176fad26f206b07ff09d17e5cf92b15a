Blackberry's phones are no longer QNX-based (they fell to the advancing
Android hordes) but they still own it and are targeting the IVI market  
with it, apparently.  They have a no-commercial-use no-cost license
available.
       
The first QNX device I saw in the wild was the 3com Audrey, which was a
little all-in-one computer with an infrared keyboard and a resistive    
touchscreen.  3com seemed to want to sell them for kitchen use, but then
the dot-com bust happened and the Audrey went with it.  The QNX
deployment on it was sufficiently unixlike that step one in doing
anything interesting was exploiting a privilege escalation and editing  
the passwd file.
