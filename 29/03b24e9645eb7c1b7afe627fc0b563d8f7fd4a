Unless you use a WYSIWYG tool that generates DocBook, you should avoid it.
Your fingers will kill you.  I have written books in troff, DocBook
and Texinfo.  Texinfo is *by far* the superior markup language.

Using Texinfo can generate DocBook which your publisher can turn into PDF.
(I have done this, three times at least.)  But working directly in
DocBook just plain hurts.

The MM macros are the most capable of the standard sets that are
out there, although possibly the MOM macros distributed with groff
are even more so; I have not investigated fully.

My own wish for the next genie in a lamp that I come across would be
for a texinfo --> troff translator.
