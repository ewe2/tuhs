Hi Paul

We talked about this a bit more in the comments on the video, with
Gavin doing some experiment afterwards.

While at the show, one experiment we did was to redirection the
bas(1)ic program's output to a file and what we found was that (a)
characters would still sometimes be lost (which is how we determined
it's not due to a serial communications, directly and (b) the dropped
characters would coalesce together into a small run.

Gavin's speculation at the time was that the floppy driver
interfered/interrupted the bas' output somehow, since we noticed there
was also disk activity coinciding roughly in time with a bout of
dropped characters.

What is unusual about Gavin's machine (at the time of this video) is
that everything was on floppies - including root, tmp, etc. because he
did not have a functioning fixed disk yet. It may be a configuration
that was rarely used, e.g., scratch space for bas on floppy. (We found
bas seems to read the source code from the file system even at
runtime.)

Any insights welcome - esp. if you can put them in the comments there.

Peace,
Dave
