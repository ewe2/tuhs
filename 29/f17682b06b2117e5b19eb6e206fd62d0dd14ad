Since we've wondered off-topic...

There are two periods of time in the spring and late summer when many
Orthodox Jews don't shave (5 and 3 weeks long, respectively). The deal
I reached with my wife is that I have a beard from the start of the
first one to the end of the second one.  It's worked now for just over
30 years... :-)
