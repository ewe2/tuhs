No, it was Jan 1.

It wasn't so much a 'conversion', as that was the date on which, except for a
few sites which got special _temporary_ dispensation to finish their
preparations, support for NCP was turned off for most ARPANET hosts. Prior to
that date, most hosts on the ARPANET had been running both, and after that,
only TCP worked. (Non-ARPANET hosts on the then-nascent Internet had always
only been using TCP before that date, of course.)
