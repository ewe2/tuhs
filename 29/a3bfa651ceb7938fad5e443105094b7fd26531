The other set of claims made, which may be stronger, was that IBM and
Redhat used their dominant position to lock out OSes other than Linux,
including FreeBSD from their cloud platform.

Their copyright claims look to be a bit different than the old SCO lawsuit.

Reading their complaint, it is somewhat different than the old suit...
FreeBSD is mentioned like 34 times too, since Xinuos based their products
based on it. And their product is locked out of the IBM/Redhat cloud
platform/ecosystem. The copyright stuff seems almost an afterthought...
