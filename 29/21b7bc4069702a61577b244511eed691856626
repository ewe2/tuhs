Subject: [TUHS] History of top
Message-ID: <7wzi0p60mj.fsf@junk.nocrew.org>

Hello,

I'm curious about the history of "top".  As far as I can see, the first
version was written by William LeFebvre and posted to net.sources in
1984.  I'm surprised it appeared that late.  Were there any other
versions or similar Unix programs before that?

Best regards,
Lars Brinkhoff
