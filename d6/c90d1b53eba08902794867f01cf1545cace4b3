A typical Canadian :-)  There is only one game, and it's called Cricket; 
where else can you see a sport that can take five days, and ends up in a 
draw?

I thought PWB (makers of "make") came from Harvard?  Other than that, Sys 
III/V was presented by suits; enough said.  System III was, well, what 
System V was going to be like...  It never had TCP/IP, only BNU (i.e. UUCP 
with a jazzed-up name).

Gahh...  I still have flash-backs to that awful "cu" command,

Perhaps it's my experience with Lionel Singer et al, but I really learned
to hate SysIII/V...
