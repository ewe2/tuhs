I see them in the context of Usenet via UUCP, so rnews.

The best that I can tell is that they are simply the messages that need 
to be sent written into a single file that is then transferred via some 
mechanism, ftp being a common one.

It looks like it might be the output of nntpsend or send-nntp.  Or 
perhaps output of downstream / related UUCP commands.

I often see it mentioned in close proximity of DNews.
