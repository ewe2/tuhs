They are still active though I can't remember what their software is
called these days. It has grown a lot of features, e.g. IMAP message
store.

According to the MMDF FAQ, MMDF was also the basis for PP, but my PP
manual says MMDF was just the inspiration, and it suggests that Kille and
his team rewrote it from scratch. PP was the UK Grey Book / X.400 mailer,
and (according to its manual) its name definitely did not stand for
Postman Pat. PP is still around as the (commercial) ISODE mail server.

When I worked at Demon Internet in 1997-2000, they were using MMDF for
their mail servers - I gather this came from their origins as a SCO
consultancy.

At Cambridge, our central email relay was named the "PP Switch" in about
1991 (IIRC) and it is still to this day called ppsw.cam.ac.uk.
