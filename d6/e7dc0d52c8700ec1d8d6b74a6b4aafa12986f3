If V10 was formally released, then yes - I would make that argument and
feel free to say it to the judge.

That said, did Caldera (and/or Nokia) officially release it or are they
just 'not noticing' that it is available in the wild?

I was under the impression that the only thing official is through V7.  But
all the other versions have 'leaked' and are widely available, and whoever
owns that IP at this point, is not pursuing protection.   I am aware that
Caldera ended up with rights of 'UNIX' - certainly through SVR5 -- and they
released V1-V7 and 32V under their license (pointed too in the earlier
message).  However, I am ownsnot aware of who formally owns V8-V10 (I would
assume Caldera also but that IP might have stayed with Lucent then Nokia as
part of that BTL IP transfer].  Also, did Nokia 'formally' release Plan9 or
Inferno -- is there a document like the Caldera one?
