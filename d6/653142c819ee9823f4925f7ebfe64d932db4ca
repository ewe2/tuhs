Remember that FORTRAN also was a latecomer. It was a shock 
to convert from the full character set of the Flexowriters at
Whirlwind to the rebarbative upper-case-only of the 704.

In that vein, there was a period when the Chicago Manual Style 
disparaged uppercase text, with an exception being made for
computer programs, which of course should be presented in           
upper case.
