I don't remember any HP-Windows, but I do remember learning UCSD Pascal 
around 1985-1986 on HP RISC-based (I think) workstations. I learned to 
control plotters over RS-232. I used Memomaker and PAM on HP 110 laptops 
(with amazing battery life). The first software I ever sold was my clone 
of PAM written in Turbo Pascal to provide a user interface (file manager 
and application menu) for generic MS-DOS.  I don't think PAM was ever 
for HPUX, but maybe.

http://www.hpmuseum.net/  knows about Memomaker.
