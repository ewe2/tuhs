My login name story has many fewer characters.  At Bell Labs, it was
common for people to use their initials as their login name.  Dennis was
dmr, I was scj, Mike Lesk was mel, etc.  (Ken was an exception--he was
ken).  When Bjarne Stroustrup joined the company, he chose the login name
bs.  Several of us tried to tactfully suggest that this might not be the
best choice, but he stuck with it...
