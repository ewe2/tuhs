It's not a composite, either.  And there are already many cases where
you have to say "let p be an _odd_ prime" because the statement fails
for p=2, so many that maybe allowing 1 in (and having to explain it away
in many more theorems) is not much worse that having it in a special
weird category of its own.

It's just terminology.
