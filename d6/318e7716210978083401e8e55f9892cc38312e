I own one of the 11/23 based models together with a 6800 and 68000 in
circuit emulator. It is complete, I have manuals, it runs some sort of
UNIX V7 caled TENIX. I have a spare 11/73 CPU board that I can plug into
it in exchange to the 11/23 CPU.

I need the instalation media or at least the stand alone tools for this
machine. It needs a fsck(8) but fsck(8) is a stand alone tool...
It would be really great if someone could help with this.

Hmmm. That machine would be a great exhibition at the next the Vintage
Computing Festival Europa.
