Thinking about this typesetter C may have been later with ditroff.  

Sent from my PDP-7 Running UNIX V0 expect things to be almost but not quite.

When the first typesetter was procured typesetter roff aka troff, was born which assumes the C/A/T as the output device (which is a binary format).    This is also were typesetter C comes from.   Note these are 3 separate and different programs although nroff and troff mostly take the same input language.  These were included in V5/6/7 IIRC
