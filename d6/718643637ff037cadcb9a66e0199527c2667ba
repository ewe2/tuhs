â€‹I do not remember the BBN share memory code, but the Columbus shared
memory and semaphore changes were certainly known in 1978 and 1979.   I
remember seeing a man page for them from one of the OYOC types - Phil Karn
maybe, but its possible it was tjk.   As quick scan of my paper archives,
did not turn anything up; and I do not remember any system at CMU that had
the code, only looking at a hard copy of the man pages.

My memory is that the API changed a little by the time they became the
System V API; as I remember thinking that the IPC was "new" when I first
saw it in a system that had all three.
