As the inventor of "at", I can tell you that cron existed for quite some=20
time, but was little used.  An arcane set of manipulations was required=20
to get things to run, and there was little demand.   But there were a=20
bunch of us all using the same PDP-11, and I wanted to add a job to run=20
at 3AM that would be a bit of CPU hog.  I struggled and finally got=20
something to work.  And thinking about it, I realized that what I really=20
wanted to say was
    at 3am command-line
I made a shell script that did the bare minimum and advertised it on=20
motd.  Within a day or two, Dennis grabbed it and made sure that the job=20
would run in the proper directory with the correct permissions, and=20
otherwise behave the way I wanted it to.

As many of you know, the rule with Unix was "you can touch anything, but=20
if you change it, you own it."  This was a great way to turn arguments=20
into progress.  I think I "owned" at for at most two days.  I had a=20
similar experience with
spell--I think my ownership of spell lasted about 2 weeks.

In both cases, I was delighted to provide the "sperm of the idea" and=20
let someone else carry and deliver the baby.
