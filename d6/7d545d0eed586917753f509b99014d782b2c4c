The problem isn't the fact that it's signed, it's the fact that it's
only a 24-bit value (i.e. the high 8 bits are replaced with
sign-extension of bit 23). Look at the hex - expected 0x499602d2 vs
actual 0xff9602d2

However, OSX only claims compliance to Issue 6 (unistd.h _XOPEN_VERSION
600), and the text requiring that the full 32-bit value be preserved is
new to Issue 7.
