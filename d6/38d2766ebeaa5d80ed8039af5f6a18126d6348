This is kind of illustrative of the '60s acid trip that perpetuates in
programming "Everything's a string maaaaan".  The output is seen as
truth because the representation is for some reason too hard to get at
or too hard to cascade through the system.

There's a total comedy of work going on in the unix way of a wc
pipeline versus calling a length function on a list.  Nonetheless, the
unix pipeline was and is often magnitude easier for a single user to
get at.  This kind of thing is amusing and endearing to me about our
profession in modern day.

Regards,
Kevin

'll bet that ? was bound to a complicated function that just displayed the =
results and didn't properly abstract out the UI (printing) from the data co=
