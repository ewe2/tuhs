The name 'ditroff' for Device Independent Troff was how AT&T marketed /
sold / licensed it when they released it to the world.  The new name
was necessary to distinguish it from the original troff in V7 / System III /
System V.

It's understandable that inside Research no such distinction was made.
Nonetheless, the V8 and V10 archives show that the C/A/T variant was
still around (at least in /usr/src/cmd) under the name otroff.

HTH,

Arnold
