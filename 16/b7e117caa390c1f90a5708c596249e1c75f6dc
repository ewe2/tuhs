Thank you!  So:
- if(1) gets as arguments an expression to evaluate and the command to 
execute if the expression is true, and
- goto(1) changes the seek offset of the shared standard input file 
descriptor to match the label's position in the file.
This is a much simpler implementation that what I thought would be the 
case, but, true to the spirit of Unix, remarkably effective.
