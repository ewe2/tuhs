No, to my knowledge NO compiler I ever came across (I worked on the dark side DOS BATCH, RT-11, RSX-11, and RSTS-11 in various languages though primarily MACRO-11 and FORTRAN) ever used this linkage.    Certainly, none of the UNIX products did.   It was goofy.    We played around with it and it just didn’t do anything you couldn’t do better with JSR/RET and some clever stack manipulation with MOV instructions.
