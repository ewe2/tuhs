It should be possible. We are now using the V2 assembler to build the
kernel a.out, which means that you could put the kernel source onto the
filesystem and do the assembly on V1 natively.

We need to recreate enough of the boot chain to make self-support possible.
James Markevitch I think was working on this; James, can you give us a
status report?
