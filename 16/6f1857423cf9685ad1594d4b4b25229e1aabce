A very nice addition to the archives. Thank you.

I well remember our disbelief that Mark Williams wrote all its own
code, unlike other vendors who had professed the same. As Dennis
described, we had fun putting together  black-box tests that
recognized  undocumented quirks (or bugs) in our code. We were
duly impressed when the results came back negative.
