I still use 80 columns on my xterms.  Like Larry said, most things in Unix
still looks perfect on 80 columns display, plus it's easier to read -- less
eye movements from left to right.  If you think about it, regular books
have a similar format.  It has been scientifically proven that very long
lines are just harder and slower to read.
