Hi Warren. Evan K. here from Vintage Computer Festival, etc.
I'm trying to find out who invented the Chroot command in Version 7 Unix.
Could you help, possibly including a post to TUHS email list on my behalf?
I posted to our local (northeast US) list and also emailed Brian Kernighan and 
Bill Cheswick.
Hoping this leads to an answer. I'm looking for a name, not just generalities.
Thanks very much.
