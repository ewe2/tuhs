OK,  I mounted the CD-ROM and looked for copyright statements.  The
only one I found was /COPYRGHT.TXT, a modified 8 paragraph BSD license
with \r\n line delimiters, attached.

Arguably it only applies to the OS sources, but it's the only license
I can see.  It probibits commercial distributions, but the important
clause from our point of view is:

   * 5. Non-commercial distribution of the complete source and/or binary
   *	release at no charge to the user (such as from an official Internet
   *	archive site) is permitted.

I was going to take out just the source tree, but another clause
states:

   * 7. Non-commercial and/or commercial distribution of an incomplete,
   *	altered, or otherwise modified source and/or binary release is not
   *	permitted.

Since this is the only copyright statement, I assume that this means I
can put up the entire CD image, but not just part of it, so that's
what I've done.  It's at http://www.lemis.com/grog/src/386BSD-1.0.bz2 .

If anybody finds anything that indicates that it shouldn't be made
available, please let me know and I'll pull it.

Greg
