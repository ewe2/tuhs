I'm sure there are all sorts of problems with C.  Somehow we both never
encountered them.

My experience is that people come up with this or that, and they are
right, there is a there there, but Eric and I, he more than me, we just
wrote a ton of code in C, like 3-4 decades, all of that code works and
works better than the people who second guess us.  Our code works.

I've been through coverity trying to tell us where the problems were,
they found none.  I've been through Intel's fancy compiler that would
make things faster, it was a .1-.5%.  I don't remember, it was nothing.

I'm good with my understanding of C.  I get that you get it at a more
detailed level, go you.  I get it at a more basic practical level and
that has served me well.
