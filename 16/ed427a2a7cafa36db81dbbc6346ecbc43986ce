In most countries of the world, including the ones all of us live in,
you don't have a choice whether to honour copyright law.  If you do
not honour copyrights, you're breaking the law.  In many countries,
even encouraging people to break the law is a crime.  If you choose to
live in such a society, the least you can do is adapt to it, no matter
how ridiculous you may consider it.  I would certainly be a lot
happier if you stopped this kind of behaviour in public.
