You probably meant "SMP", built by Wolfram and others at Caltech:
http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/smp-symbolic-manipulation-program/

It sounds like Mathematica probably did not _directly_ derive from SMP
due to a court ruling.

  "A dispute with the administration over the intellectual property
rights regarding SMP—patents, copyright, and faculty involvement in
commercial ventures—eventually caused him to resign from Caltech.
SMP was further developed and marketed commercially by Inference Corp.
of Los Angeles during 1983–1988."

Curiously, the above text has been copied and pasted verbatim all
over the web and it's not clear where it originated. "SMP was
essentially Version Zero of the more ambitious Mathematica system" is
also all over the web including Wikipedia.

Nowadays we'd just run gcc :)
